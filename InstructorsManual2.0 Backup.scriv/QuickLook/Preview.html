  Declassification<br/>
The declassification of homosexuality is assured.  The only characters who argue against it are Bieber and Socarides.  The NY Times obituary of Socarides quotes Gilbert Herdt of National Sexuality Resource Center in San Francisco as saying “Socarides outlived his time.” That is roughly correct. While it may not have occurred to many psychiatrists in 1971 that the classification of homosexuality was a problem for the homosexual community, once it was pointed out,...</p>

In many ways, this is not a game about Psychology or Psychiatry, it is a game about the Philosophy of Science. This shouldn't really be surprising, as the history of the Psychology and Psychiatry is intimately linked to the history of the Philosophy of Science. Arguments made by Wundt, Freud, Watson, Hull Skinner and Miller all rely heavily on claims regarding what is or is not a legitimate scientific claim. This issues has not disappeared from underg...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Rules and Procedures</strong><br/> While there is a great deal to prepare for this game, my experience has taught me that the largest challenge the students will face is understanding that psychology and psychiatry were not always as they are now presented.  Most students come to the game believing that (a) psychology is a science and (b) psychiatry is a medical practice.  Both of those claims were not settled in the public mind in 1970.  In fact, most of the tension in this game revolves around the efforts to make psychiatry co...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Voting</strong><br/>  Voting<br/>
I've left the issue of membership in the APA, and the right to vote on many of the main issues, intentionally vague. This is to allow for some flexibility for the instructor. The issue of who can practice mental health treatment is a game issue, realized in competing proposals in 1973.  As a corrollary then, the issue of membership in the APA may be brought forward. This can also play out as one of the causes of the great 'fission' that may occur starting in 1975.<br/>

 Emotional responses in a human child.<br/>
Background: Many psychologists--Freud included--have held, with little evidence in support, that the human mind is built on a variety of instincts, such as self-preservation, sexual activity, etc. Emotional responses to fearful stimuli, such as rats and spiders, is commonly considered to be innate, possibly as a result of evolutionary pressures to avoid infectious or poisonous creatures.  This experiment seeks to condition a fear-response in a human infant...</p>

Mental rotation of three-dimensional objects<br/>
Background: Mentally rotating 3-dimensional objects is one indicator of spatial reasoning in humans. And it is one that is tempting to explain in terms of internal mental imagery. The 'cognitive hypothesis' holds that in order to solve mental rotation problems, a cognitive representation of the presented object must be rotated in the mind before an identification can be made - and it is that hypothesis that we wish to test here.<br/>
Rationale: When asked...</p>

On Being Sane in Insane Places<br/>
<br/>
Background<br/>
However much mental health practitioners may be personally convinced that we can tell the normal from the abnormal, the evidence is simply not compelling. It is commonplace, for example, to read about murder trials wherein eminent psychiatrists for the defense are contradicted by equally eminent psychiatrists for the prosecution on the matter of the defendant's sanity. More generally, there are a great deal of conflicting data on the reliability, utili...</p>

Adjustment of Homosexual and Heterosexual Women<br/>
Background The traditional psychiatric belief that homosexual men are emotionally unstable has recently been challenged by Evelyn Hooker's study of non-prisoner non-patient homosexual men.  There have been a few similar studies on women.  The contention that homosexual women are neurotic has typically been voiced by clinicians reporting on their own patients. One exception is the recent psychometric investigation by Kenyon (1968) who studied a non...</p>

A Re-analysis of the Reliability of Psychiatric Diagnosis<br/>
Introduction<br/>
Classification systems such as diagnosis have two primary properties, reliability and validity. Reliability refers to the consistency with which subjects are classified; validity, to the utility of the system for its various purposes. In the case of psychiatric diagnosis, the purposes of the classification system are communication about clinical features, aetiology, course of illness and treatment. A necessary constraint on ...</p>

Interpersonal Dynamics in a Simulated Prison<br/>
Background<br/>
After he had spent four years in a Siberian prison the great Russian novelist Dostoevsky commented, surprisingly, that his time in prison had created in him a deep optimism about the ultimate future of mankind because, as he put it, if man could survive the horrors of prison life he must surely be a “creature who could withstand anything.” In the century which has passed since Dostoevsky’s imprisonment, little has changed to render the mai...</p>
