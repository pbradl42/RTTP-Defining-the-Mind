            <Title>MentalRotation</Title>
            <Text>
Mental rotation of three-dimensional objects
Background: Mentally rotating 3-dimensional objects is one indicator of spatial reasoning in humans. And it is one that is tempting to explain in terms of internal mental imagery. The 'cognitive hypothesis' holds that in order to solve mental rotation problems, a cognitive representation of the presented object must be rotated in the mind before an identification can be made - and it is that hypothesis that we wish to test here.
Rationale: When asked to match three-dimensional objects presented in two-dimensional format, individuals report imagining the object in three-dimensions and rotating them mentally to test against the other possibilities. Introspective reports are, of course, notoriously difficult to address in a scientific way, but that does not mean that we cannot study the phenomenon. If individuals are manipulating mental representations, we would expect a measurable difference in reaction time given a matching task.
Experimental Design: A number of adult subjects (the size of the class) will presented with pairs of two-dimensional line drawings of three-dimensional blocks. Each subject will be asked to indicate as quickly as possible if the two were drawings of the same object rotated in space or different objects. Half of the experimental set will be rotated versions of the same object, the other half not. They will be presented to the subjects in random order. The time it takes to respond will be measured using computer software. We hypothesize that the amount of time necessary to respond will be correlated with the angle of rotation of the two objects, thus establishing the cognitive hypothesis.

Significance and Contribution
This research has the potential to discover observable data that is consistent with the introspective reports of individuals.

            <Text>￼ConceptffiGTO SLEER PERCFTANCE TO DREAM Ludy T. Benjamin, Jr.There are probably more m5rths and misunderstandings about sleep and dreaming than about any other aspect of human behavior except sex.For most people, sleep and dreamingwill occupy one third of their lives, yet few individuals are aware of even the most rudimentary information about this activity. For example, consider tJre following facts: Apparently everyone dreams; that i;, there are no nondreamers, only nonrecallers. In an 8-hour night of sleep most people will have from four to five dreams, usually on quite unrelated topics. The great majority of dreams are in color. Sleep leaming apparently does not occur. Dreams are not always filled with easily interpretable psychological meanings, as popular literature would have one believe.The study of sleep and dreaming is still in its infancy. Most of what we know about this area is the result of research occurring in the last 25 years and is principally due to the development of electrophysiological techniques (particularly the electroencephalograph, or EEG) and the discovery, in 1953, of rapid eye movements (REMs) during sleep.The purposes of this exercise are (a) to help students focus attention on their own sleep and dreaming patterns, (b) to generate data for class discussion, (c) to introduce students to the concept of data collection in sleep and dreaming, (d) to illustrate appropriate statistical measures for summarizing the data, and (e) to aid students in understanding the interpretation of data in general and these data in particular.Pass out the "Sleep and Dreaming Record" to each student, providing multiple copies-one for each day that records will be kept (14 consecutive nights provides a good sample). Tell the students why the data are being collected and indicate that participation is voh:ntary. Explain that they can conceal their identity by marking their records with a number (six or seven digits in length) that they make up on their own. This procedure allows them to identify their statistics in reference to others in class when the srurunary data are provided later. Note that it takes only about 5 minutes each day to complete tlre record.Ask all students to begrn their records on the same day and to keep their record sheets at home. Request ttrat during the time the records are being kept, discussion among students regarding their sleep and dreaming pattems be minimal to avoid unintentional influences on the data. Give explicit instructions on record keeping. (It is a good idea to have one "practice run" to insure that everyone understands the record- keeping system before continuing for 14 days.) The record provided is only a sample. Feel free to modify it as appropriate.When the time period is completed and students have turned in all of their records, the tedious part begins for the fsagfrgl-thsPreparation of ClassInstructions796ACTIVITIES HANDBOOKMISCELLACTIVITYDiscussir

Each student's records should be summarized separately, and data should be anaTyzedfor the group as a whole. A summary sheet for the students should then be prepared, which lists everyone who participated (by number) and provides the group analyses. For example, Student# rcZAS+ can examine tl-rat column number of the summary sheet to find a mean sleep time of 7.3 hours (over 14 days), with a range of 5.6-9.7 hours. The student can then compare these figures with those of other students and with those for the class as a whole, based on the group data.Sleep and Drcaminp RecordStudent Number Date1.

Obituary for Harry Frederick Harlow (1905-1981). Harlow's research career, spanning a full half century, was notable for its single-minded adherence to the search for understanding of a single species, for the imaginative methods he devised for the study of both cognition and motivation, and for the crucially important findings these methods provided. His careful empirical development of the facts of behavioral development led to prepositional generalizations that have contributed notably to an understanding of human as well as monkey motivational development.

On Being Sane in Insane Places

Background
However much mental health practitioners may be personally convinced that we can tell the normal from the abnormal, the evidence is simply not compelling. It is commonplace, for example, to read about murder trials wherein eminent psychiatrists for the defense are contradicted by equally eminent psychiatrists for the prosecution on the matter of the defendant's sanity. More generally, there are a great deal of conflicting data on the reliability, utility, and meaning of such terms as “sanity,” “insanity,” “mental illness” and “schizophrenia.” Finally, as early as 1934, Ruth Benedict suggested that normality and abnormality are not universal. What is viewed as normal in one culture may be seen as quite aberrant in another.
Rationale
How do we know precisely what constitutes “normality” or mental illness? Conventional wisdom suggests that specially trained professionals have the ability to make resolably accurate diagnoses. In this research, however, we intend to challenge that assumption. What is—and what is not-- “normal” may have to do with the labels that are applied to people in particular settings.
Experimental Design
Eight sane people, of varied backgrounds, will gain secret admission to 12 different hospitals, from varied geographical regions of the United States. Their diagnostic experiences will constitute the data of the of the study.  The 'pseudopatients' will call the hospital for an appointment, complaining of 'hearing voices.' When asked what the voices said, they will reply that it was unclear, but that they were 'empty,' 'hollow,' and 'thud.'  The pseudopatients will report that voices were unfamiliar and in the same gender as the pseudopatient. After admission to the psychiatric ward, the pseudopatient will cease simulating symptoms of abnormality.  
The amount of time it takes for the pseudopatient to be released, along with any diagnoses and treatments, will be recorded.
Significance and Contributions
This study provides and opportunity to test the reliability of psychiatric diagnosis in the 'real world,' rather than the controlled environment of a university lab.  The hospital environment imposes a special environment on its members in which the actions of a normal person could be misinterpreted as 'insane' or 'abnormal.'  This study will determine the extent of that influence on psychiatric diagnosis.

GardnerWe often make judgments about the behavior of other people, determining whether particular acts were or were not appropriate. Occasionallywe may even decide, based on our observations, *rat someone is "mentally ill." This exercise offers a classroom opportunity to study such attributions.Ask for six volunteers to play roles in a skit. Take them out of the room and have them choose a role from six 3 x 5 inch cards bearing the following descriptions:1. You are an escaped convict, previously convicted of murder. 2. You are a successful business executive whose spouse justannounced the existence of a love affair, whose child is in the hospital, and whose car broke down this moming.3. You are married with two children and unemployed; you desperately need a job and are on your way to an interview.4. You are on yourway to a sale.5. You are lonely, have few friends, became bored watching TV, and are going somewhere just to have something to do.6. You are waiting at the bus stop for the bus. Your role is to try to engage each of the waiting passengers in conversation so that the class can observe how they act. Some questions that you might ask are: Do you have the proper time? Does the bus usually run late?While the actors study their roles, return to the room and instnrct the other students to observe closely the behavior of each actor. Bring in tlre actor who drew the sixth role-the catalyst. Then bring in the other actors one by one, and let them interact with the catalyst for about 1 minute each.When the skit is over, have the actors return to their seats. On the chalkboard, set up a matrix with the names of the actors in a vertical column on the left; list them in any order, except put tlre catalyst's name last. Tell the class that the six actors were playing rolds, that you are going to list those roles across the top of tlre matrix, and tJlat you are going to poll the class to determine how many believe each actor could have been piaying each role. AIso tell them that you are going to include a role that no one played. Then list the roles one at a tjme, polling students on each one before you list the next. List the roles in the same order as they appear above, but insert "a mentally ill person" between the third and fourth roles.Adapted from tlre "Mental Illness Game" by James M.

Adjustment of Homosexual and Heterosexual Women
Background The traditional psychiatric belief that homosexual men are emotionally unstable has recently been challenged by Evelyn Hooker's study of non-prisoner non-patient homosexual men.  There have been a few similar studies on women.  The contention that homosexual women are neurotic has typically been voiced by clinicians reporting on their own patients. One exception is the recent psychometric investigation by Kenyon (1968) who studied a non-clinical group of English homosexual women, and concluded that they were higher in neuroticism than a comparison group of heterosexuals. In contrast to the 'illness' notion of homosexuality, the authors of three psychometric studies dealing with non-clinical homosexuals and heterosexuals reported that heterosexual women were not better adjusted than homosexuals. (Armon, 1960; Freedman, 1968;
Rationale
The paucity of research in this area is exemplified by the fact that a total of only four studies, noted above, have been found to date. Even the clinical literature, which is replete with case studies and therapeutic discussions concerning male homosexuality, is strikingly sparse in the area of lesbianism. The present study is proposed to add to the small body of data we now have on the adjustment of homosexual versus heterosexual women.
Experimental Design
Working with the leadership of the New York branch of the Daughters of Bilitis, a questionnaire will be sent out to recruit members for the study. And additional questionnaire will be distributed through a popular homophile bookstore in Greenwich Village, New York. And equivalent number of heterosexual women will be recruited from the undergraduate and graduate population of local colleges and universities.
Several different instruments will be used to measure the overal psychological adjustment of the participants, including Scheier and Cattal's Neuroticism Scale Questionnaire (NSQ) (1961) tests of Alienation and Trust (Struening &amp; Richardson, 1965), Goal Directedness, Self-Acceptance and Sense of Self (Dignan, 1965), Dependency (Comry, 1964), Nurturance (Harvey et al. 1966) and Neuroticism (MacGuire 1966). The Crowne and Marlow Social Desirability Scale (1960) will also be used.  The differences on these measures between the homosexual and heterosexual women will be compared to test the 'illness' model of homosexuality in women..
Significance and Contribution
Recent interest in and discussions of the 'illness' model of male homosexuality have almost completely ignored the parallel issues for homosexual women. This study is a small step towards closing that gap.

The music from the movie )aws could be replaced by music from any currcntthriller, with appropriate modifications in imagery. No prior knowledge of psychol- ogy is necessary, and the activity is suitable for classes of all sizes.CoNceprMlrrnrlts NrrorolNsrnucrrotsThe concept of classical conditioning is often difficult for students to grasp if the instructor immediately begins to use the time-honored example of Pavlov and his dogs. The students may get lost in the maze of terms-Us, UR, CR, CS-and fail to see any relevance between slobbering dogs and human leaming. Thus I think that it is important to begin a presentation of classical conditioning with a real-life example that most students have experienced.You will need a tape recording of a few seconds of the shark-attack music from the movie /aws.I use this demonstration at the beginning of the section on conditioning in general psychology classes before I introduce the concepts. First I ask students to close their eyes and engage in mental imagery. I tell them to imagine that it is a hot summer day and that they are at the beach. The sun is scorching. They are getting hotter and hotter, can stand it no longer, run toward the ocean, and splash in the shallow water. Then they swim out to deeper water and enjoy cooling off after being in the sun. It is fairly easy to stretch this imagery process out for 2 or 3 minutes. Then, as unobtrusively as possible, I start the music ftom [aws.

Without knowing the appropriate classical conditioning terms/ students are able to explain in their own words what happened during the movie. They can tell you that the shark (technically a CS, but a US in this demonstration) yields a response of fear or disgust (the UR).

J. \MoodsThis activify provides an intriguing introduction to discussions of the accuracy and reliability of humans as observers of behavioral events and environmental characteristics.A portable tape recorder, some imagination, and decent weather.Introduce the activity to the students simply by explaining that you are going to test their powers of observation-their skill as observers. TelI them that you are going to ask a colleague of yours (or a particular member of the class) to lead the class on a 15- or 2O-minute joumey around the school grounds. Inform the students that nothing unusual has been planned, and instruct tlrem simply to observe the normal activities and circumstances in which they find themselves. They can be told thatfollowing the walk, you will be asking them some questions about their observations.As your colleague or class member is leading the class on the joumey aror:nd the campus, follow a strort distance behind-close enough to be able to observe the class and its environment but sufficiently removed to be able to speak quietly into a portable tape recorder without being heard by the class. As the walk proceeds, record approximately 50-60 questions on the tape, spontaneously drawn from your own observations of events and objects. (You may wish to prearrange the route to be followed and walk it through once by yourself to practice the questioning routine.) Each question you record should be followed immediately by the answer. Questions should be completely factual and objectively confirmable. Following are some examples:"How many planes flew overhead as we reached the playing field?""In what activily was tfre first group of students encountered by the class engaged?""Where was the class when the nearby tmck backfired?""What color was the car that passed tlte class at the entrance to the parking lot?"Avoid questiprns with answers that are a matter of opinion ("Was it a nice day?" "Did it se'em waim?" ).Upon returning to the classroom, play each recorded question in turn and stop the recorder before the correct answer is played. Have students write their answers down on paper, and then play back the correct answer. On the chalkboard, keep a record of the number of right and wrong answers to each question.The broad variation in student responses should provide gist for a discussion of (a) the reliabitity of human observations, (b) the "truth" of courtroom testimony, (c) the benefits of structuring tJre collection ofYDBOOKMETHODOLOGYConcePtMaterials Needed lnstruc{ionsDiscussion

There is little advance preparation, and it is suitable for c/asses of virtually any size. You will need to give some thought to how you will instruct the"experimenter(s)" in the procedures without informing the learnels) during this in-class exercise.CotlctPrHuman operant conditioning is often demonstrated by asking the subject to say nouns and then rein{orcing the plural but not the singular form. Another technique is to ask the subject to say numbers and then reinforce those numbers divisible by 2. The short- coming of these procedures is that the subject is limited by the instructions to two classes of responses, whereas the animal in the typical Skinner box can make many more different responses even if the space is limited. In addition, the procedures do not display shaping of the response by successive approximation, and as a consequence, there are no changes in the criteria for reinforcement that are present in shaping. Moteover, during extinction, one cannot watch the behavior revert to previously re- warded responses. These shortcomings can be minimized by doing the activity out-lined here.No materials are required except pencil and paper. Score sheets must be constructed by those doing the rein{orcing.Twelve words are shown to the subject, and his or her instructions are simply to try to get as many points as possible. He or she is to say the word, and following the word the experimenter will say either "Point" or "No point." The experimenter should record which word was given and whether a reinforcement was given for each trial. The words to be used are underfed, misread, understand, underctudy, mistake, mistead, underctanding, mistaken, underpaid, underctandingly, misinform, and mistakenly.The experimenter first reinJorces any word that begins with "mis," by saying "Point." Once the subject has picked three words in succession that begin with the syllable "mis" and received three reinforcements in succession, the experimenter should change the criterion so that-rein{orcement is received only if the first two syilables "mistake . ." ate chosen., Again, after the subject has received three rein- forcements in succession, the criterion is changed so that only the word with the three syllables "mistaken . ." is reinforced. AJter three more successive reinforcements/ only the word "mistakenly" is reinJorced. After five correct responses in succession, the reinforcement is no longer given for any word, thus beginning the extinction proc- ess. The extinction session should last at least three minutes.LEARNING AND MEMORY r67Mlrrntlls Nrrorolxstnucrrors
￼DrscussrolThe students can work in pairs, with one as the subject and one as the erperi- menter, or one student can be used to demonstrate the phenomena. Ask the subiect to pick his or her words by number, because that will facilitate recording the responses. Ir order to draw a cumulative response cunre, it is necessary to have someone record how many cofiect responses occur in each 3-minute period.Once the cumulative response eurves for acquisition and extinction have been drawn, have students make observations on the rate of responding (indicated by the slopet. You might dsk them to try to specify what a reacquisition curve might look like or.a curve showing spontaneorii' recovery. If a number of subiects are conditioned then individual differences in rate will occur, so you may wish to ask what is it about the behavior in the situation that might account for such individual differences. The re- gression back through previously reinforced responses that is often observed in ani- mals may also occur. Ask the class how such behavior-going back through previously reinforced responses-might be adaptive for an animal in its natural environment.Gleitman, H. (1986). Psychology {2nd ed., pp. 101-ll3f.

Yet most of us tend to downplay that role, possibly feeling that to admit such control over our behavior would be to admit that our lives are overly determined. Often when students read in their texts about classical and operant conditioning, tJrey tend to associate that type of leaming with infrahuman animals. That is, "Dogs, rats, and pigeons are aflected by conditioning, but it doesn't play any role in my behavior." This activity is designed to provide a starting point for discussion of conditioning in humans.While discussing operant conditioning, intermpt your lecture with "Oh, by the way, before I forget again" and then ask a question to which you know you will get either an almost totally positive or negative response. For example, if your students are primarily seniors, you might say, "f was supposed to ask, how many of you have signed for a diploma for graduation?" All students will usually raise a hand. Then tell them to hold the position they are in and ask if anyone told them to raise their hands or even mentioned raising hands.The usual response is a chorus of groans as the students recognize that they have been "used." Discuss the activit5i as an example of human conditioning. Ask students to generate other examples that describe conditioning in humans. You can use the ensuing discussion as a bridge to talking about conditioning techniques used with humans in behavior therapy.Bellack, A. S., &amp; Hersen, M.

Younglndiana University-Purdue Univetsity at Fort WaWeStudents develop hands-on skills in problem formulation, classification of disorders, developing treatment plans, and assessing the prognoses of actual or simulated clients in this exercise. Although a.film or video presentation of a clinical interview works best,.you can do this activity with an audiotaped interview or even a written history. The simulation procedure generally should be introduced 4 to 5 weeks into the course, afterstudents have been prepared in the background they will need to engage lin this miniclinic assessrnent exercise. A full class session for the actual presentation of the interview, the assessment, and ensuingdiscussion is recommended. The student worksheets for completing the assessrnent are provided.CorucrptMany notable teachers of psychology, textbook authors, and practicing psychologists (Beniamin &amp; Lowman, 1981, McKeachie,I9TSi Radford 8L Rose, I980| have im- plored professors to give undergraduate students the experience of actually working at the tasks that psychologists perform. In many undergraduate lecture courses, students become oriented to what clinicians do and may even observe audiotaped or videotaped examples of clinical activities. Yet, because of ethical concerns (e.g., confidentiality problems, using untrained students to make interventions or impor- tant decisions regarding a client) or the sheer numbers of students involved, psychol- ogy students are rarely directed to-attempt the hands-on exercise of clinical skills. When students are tested in abnormal psychology courses, they are often expected to make diagnostic decisions, provide a prognosis, and define the relevance of particu- lar forms of therapy for different disorders-all based on fragments of hypothetical cases, often presented in the form of multiple-choice items. This article describes a method that involves students in the relevant simulation of a variety of clinical experiences. We have employed these techniques or "miniclinics" in several courses that contain units related to clinical assessment and intervention (e.g. abnormal,child development, and introductory psychology courses).Besides the three student worksheets that are replicated here, the most important element of the miniclinic exercise is the case material presented by the instructor- ideally, written background information and films or videotapes. Satisfactory but less revealing and stimulating for discussion are written case histories.Recently, there has been an increase in both the quality and the selection of clinical vignettes {both actual and simulated productions). These are often available from book publishers for a small fee or at no charge to instructors who have adopted the publisher's text book in abnormal psychology.The film catalogues of colleges and universities are another excellent source of such material. The film "Otto-A Case Study in Abnormal Behavior" (Film No. ECl404, l6; available from the Audio-Visual Center, Indiana University, Bloom- ington, IN 47405-5901) features a case enactment designed to be studied from thePERSONALITY, ABNORMAL, AND CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGY r 163

This fine fiim mav he ^.r^_ separately or in a series o? fil*, dlsphying various representat;;;;r;:Jil:[: the hypothetical Otro from their own model of therapy.The paper-and-pencil materials include three worksheers: (a) Intake and prob- lem Formulation, (bl DSM-III classification, and (c) Treatment plan and Prognosis. These forms should be reproduced for each student.Undergraduate students are assigned at random to one of several ,,clinic,, groups representing a model or school of psychopathology (e.g., psychoanalytic, behalvioral, client-centered, existential, biological). we harr" iorrrJ thargroups of 6-t0 sruden$ function effectively for these- exercises. During the course of the semester, asare convened, students are rot'ated to other models. This procedure ensures "tini., that eachstudent is exposed to the full complement of therapeutic approaches and helps each student develop ease of communication with other members of the class.The clinic simulation procedure is generally introduced approximately 4 or 5 weeks into the semester. This timing permits the instructor to cover, in standard sequence/ introductory chapters on abnormal psychology, the various models or approaches to psychopathology, the chapters on classification and assessment pro- cedures, and at least one content chapter focusing on the disorders themselves. There chapters are usually followed by material covering the remaining cliagnostic catego- ries- The experienced instructor will frequently find that most textbooks follow tLis fairly standard sequence.Critical to the success of the exercise is the effective introduction of the material in chapters about models of psychopathology and the Diagnostic and. Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Third Edition (DSM-III;American psychiatric Associa- tion, 1980)' When these chapters are taught (and they should be introduced early in the coursef , it is important to prepare the students for the eventual clinic exercise by demonstrating how a case can be viewed by the various models, regardless of the diagnosis agreed upon from the DSM-III. For example, depression can be viewed asresulting from a chemical imbalance, from a reduction in reinforcement, or from a symbolic loss accentuated by a fixation in the oral stage of development. Thus, before students are actually given the clinic assignment, it is imporianr that they have understood to some degree the ideas behind the various models, the nature of the classification system, and at least one area of disorders outlined in the DSM-\il,Tirne requirements for the exercise vary with the depth of each instructor's involvement with the procedure. For example, some instructors may not wish to have the clinic groups complete each form for each case presented. However, aker the stimulus case has been presented, at least 30 minutes of discussion and process' ing should be made available for the groups. Additional time for a general review of each group's findings, a discussion of agreement within and among groups, and apresentation of new material by the instructor is needed. fo, thoroug=h-processing of the exercise, a full hour should be allotted. Group discussion ,.rd ti" irocessing of information can be carried over from one class session to the next. However,wehave found the process to be smoother when the entire exercise is completed within one class session. Problems of absenteeism/ retention of the case matJrial, and so forth are minimized when closure is achieved within one crass period.Students in each of the miniclinics are presented with an overview of the natlJt,e of the learning task. prior to the acrual presentation of case -r;;;i;;;.rJ.nrc ineach clinic are reminded of the particular concerns and variables relevant to their discr164 zACTIVITIES HANDBOOK, VOL. 3.

The psychoanalytical group is, for example, cued to look for important fea- tures of early childhood, for current defense mechanisms employed, and for the possible forms that an eventual transference might take. Simiiar coaching is directed toward members of other miniclinics. These instructions are provided to students in a general session so students can become further aware of the di.fferentiation in task and approach of the various therapeutic schools.When clinic assignments and the general review have been completed, the full case presentation is made, starting with background information provided by the instructor. Each group also receives a copy of the written case history. it is helpful to select cases with a good deal of background information so that students from each clinic have enough potential information to make a case for the relevance or efficacy of their mode. After the background information is presented, the recording of the case is played. Next, students divide into clinic groups to discuss the case and to complete the paper-and-pencil assignments. While the students are working in their groups, it is helpful for the instructor to interact with each group in progress.The paper-and-pencil assignments consist of three worksheets: Intake and Problem Formulation, DSM-III Classification, and Treatment Plan and Prognosis. Students are instructed to tailor their observations to their assigned perspective on the Intake and Problem Formulation Worksheet. For example, under the Historical Antecedent section, behaviorists are encouraged to note possible early learning his- tories, psychoanalysts are told to report possible developmental trauma, and stu- dents in the physiological clinic are directed to focus on possible early signs of neurological disorder, brain iniury, congenital problem, and so forth. Each student is required to complete this form, although group discussion may take place before each student has completed the assignment.The DSM-III worksheet requires students in each of the clinics to review all five axes of the DSM-/IL Of course, students are informed that they will rarely utilize all axes in classifuing a case. As with the intake and Problem Formulation Worksheet, each student is required to complete a form after group discussion. Students are encouraged to stick to their guns even if others in the clinic disagree. Because of this practice, reliability estimates may be made for each clinic,The classification exercise is followed by the completion of the Treatment Plan and Prognosis Worksheet. It is here that students are able to exercise the most creativity and to display familiarity with their assigned model of practice. Interven- tions should be justified on the basis of problem documentation and relevance to the student's particular mode. The prognosis section is also to be completed with refer- ence to the assigned model and with consideration of the available resources and circumstances relevant to the model (e.g., How well would an older adult with an IQ of 7S do in traditional psychoanalysis?).With the worksheets completed, the full class reassembles to process the results of the exercise. The instructor leads d discussion of each worksheet activity, high- lighting the points of view for each model represented. In addition, a discussion of agreement or disagreement on diagnosis, etiology, and treatment both within and among groups may be held. Rough estimates of percent agreement within groups may be calculated by simply dividing the number of agreements (with the correct diagnostic category) by the combined number of agreements and disagreements within each group. It should be made clear to students, however, that this number is only a rough estimate that is probably inflated because it does not account for the number of agreements that would be expected by chance.

Advantages include teaching students the rigors of keeping within theoretical models, teaching the logical connection between an etio- logical conception of problems and interventions associated with particular models, and exploring the problem of how models relate (or do not relate| to the current classification system. Finally, students are able to learn clinical material *ittrout rote. They learn that the DSM-II/ is a real tool and enjoy exercising their diagnostic skill through safe risk taking in the miniclinic.The problems associated with this process include the always-present possibility that passive students will remain passive and let others complete the exercise. The medical students/ disease syndrome and the phenomena of the "instant expert/, can also be stimulated by this activity, yet early warnings and effective feedback in class can do much to prevent these problems.One final and nontechnical note summarizing the process is in order: Both students and instructors who use this process find it a lot of fun!American Psychiatric Association. {1980).

Then cut these 2-inch squares into a variet5r of shapes. TWenty of the pieces should have only straight edges, and 20 pieces should have at least one curved side each. (Save them in an envelope for repeated use.) Mix up the paper shapes and spread them out on a desk or table top. Ask for a student volunteer. Tell the volunteer to start picking up the pieces of paper one at a time and place them in a box. Each time the student picks one of the pieces that has a curye on it, say "Yes, that is correct." Each time the student picks up a completely straight-edged piece, give no reinforcement at all. Usually within 10 to 15 draws, the student will "learn" what has been defined as the "correct response" and will swiftly continue picking up pieces until all of the curved pieces are gone. (The students observing usually begin to approvingly glggle as the volunteer receives rapid positive reinforcements.)Ask the student to tell the class what she or he has learned. Be sure to point out to the class thatthe only input given the student (aside frorn the initial direction to pick up pieces) was in the form of Positive Reinforcement. Nothing was said about shapes or any other facet of the task. Ask t.I:e student to relate to the class what went through his or her mind during the leaming process. Various trial-and-error strategies often emerge here (e.g., "At first I thought it was the larger pieces that were correct because t}le first big one I picked up was correct.")

The main purposes of this activity are to help students (a) understand the importance of having clear operational definitions, (b) learn to calculate interobserver reliability, and (d think about ways to improve a study that has low interobserver reliability. ln addition, students gain practice in using time sampling and come to realize that observation as a data collection technique is more complex than casual observation.CorvcrprMerrrrals NrroeoThis exercise heips students realize that observation as a data collection tech- nique is more complex than casual observation. It introduces students to the use of time sampling, the calculation of interobserver reliability, and the importance of having clear operational deftnitions.You will need a tO-min videotape of human or animal behavior, a VCR and mon- itor for showing the tape to the class, a watch with a second hand, and enough copies of the handouts described later for each student in the class. Students will need pencils and will probably want calcuiators.To be most effective, the videotape should be of a group of humans or animals that are active enough to produce several different types of behaviors. If at least some of those behaviors occur quite frequently and in several individuals at a time, students will come away with a better understanding of why time sampling is useful. My tape is of a group of white geese at a local park. (I would be happy to provide a copy of this taped segment to anyone who sends me a blank video- tape.) There are many other possibilities for foo-tage that will meet the previously described requirements. For example, you could videotape small children perform- ing at a school program or playing at a birthday pafty, or you could get some footage of one of the livelier species at your local zoo. If you or someone you know is planning to visit another country you may be able to obtain a tape of. festival or other group event from another culture. The videos that some univer- sities make of their graduation ceremonies could also be used. If you have access to a VCR, you could tape a segment of an appropriate televised event. Althoughmany television programs show groups engaging in behaviors that meet the cri- teria identified at the beginning of this discussion, most do not show this activity, uninterrupted by close-ups of individuals or pans to scenery and other locationsRISEARcH METHoDs AND srArlsrrcs r57^

There are exceptions, however, that would make good tapes for this activity: Televised New Year's Eve bashes usually show quite long segments of partyers, sporting events such as basketball or volleyball also show fairly long segments of activity on the court, and dance club shows on cable channels run segments of coupies dancing for the duration of a complete song.Prepare three handouts. The ffrst should contain a data collection sheet with a row for each observation interval and a column for each behavior students are to record (see appendix A). The second should contain a list of behaviors (I rec- ommend no more than six to eight), their operational definitions {some of which are purposely clearer than others), and a simple formula for inter-rater reliability (see appendix B). The third handout should contain a set of postobsewation ques- tions (see appendix C).This activity should be prefaced with a lecture on the use of observation tech- niques, including the advantages and disadvantages of time sampiing in relation to other observation techniques (e.g., event sampling and narrative recording) and the concept of interobserver reliability. Although the basic observation techniques described in methods textbooks are much the same, the labels given to particular techniques vary. The following definitions of observation technrques are provided to facilitate gathering background lecture material and to prevent misunderstand- ing.Time sampling is a technique in which the observer defi.nes several target behaviors, divides the observation period into short intervals, and then alternates from observing to recording every other interval. In contrast, in event sampling the observer deftnes a target behavior and records every instance of that behavior as it occurs throughout the observation period . A narrative recording is a running description of behavior in which everything that is said or done during the ob- servation period is recorded. The following are particularly useful sources for lec- ture material: chapter 5 from Bordens and Abbott 11996l, chapters 5,7, and 8 from Martin and Bateson (1993); and chapter 19 from Martin and Pear (19961.Give each student all three handouts, and allow them a few minutes to read through the list of behaviors and operational definitions and become familiar with the layout of the data collection sheet. Have students work in 15-s intervals- alternating between 15 s for observing and 15 s for recording observations com- pleted in the previous 15-s interval. For each observation interval, they simply look for whether or not each target behavior occurs. If the behavior occurs at least once in the observation intewal, they are to place a tally mark in the appropriate column on the data sheet during the recording interval. Rather than having stu- dents keep track of their own intervals, use a watch with a second hand to time intervals for them. It works best if you simply call out "observe" or "teeord" at the beginning of alternate lS-s intervals. Explain to students that data collection will last for a total of 10 min. Each minute represents an observation period and is divided into 30-s sessions. During each 30-s session, students will have a 15-s interval to observe the behavior on the videotape and a lS-s intewal to record their observations. It is important for students to understand what they are ob- serving and recording; be sure to explain that they are recording the occurrence of target behaviors. That is, they are looking for whether or not a behavior occuls; they are not looking for the number of times a speciffc behavior occurs.58 IACTTVTilES HANDBOOK, VOL. 4
￼I tDtscussloNAfter 10 min, have students stop observing and work on the postobservation questions {see appendix C). As appendix C illustrates, students will ftrst answer several questions individuall, then compare those answers with a partner, and finally calculate interobserver reliability with their partner for each of the target behaviors.Follow up with a class discussion of students' responses to the postobservation questions. Focus on those questions where partners' responses differed most often and on those behaviors that had the highest and lowest interobserver reliability. Then discuss possible reasons for these trends. With my tape of geese and set of behaviors, for example, students generally have very high interobserver reliability for displays and for tail shakes and low reliability for feeding and submission. When exploring possible reasons for these findings, student comments tend to focus on the importance of careful operational definitions and on problems with observation. For example, students notice that my operational definition of dis- play behavior is much more concrete than my definition of submission, that the definition for feeding was too narrow to encompass much of what they wanted to be able to code as feeding behavior, and that several of the behaviors were difftcult to identify accurately because of the distance from which the videotape was shot. For example, one student declared that she wanted a better definition of feeding, because "sometimes I thought they might be, but I couldn't see if they really had food in their mouths or not."Next ask students to offer possible solutions for the reliability problems they have encountered. We talk about clarifying operational definitions. For example, several students decided that "touching beak to the ground several times in a row" would have defined feeding in a way that would have allowed them to record what they thought was feeding behavior. Students also brought up the possibility of reviewing the tape and discussing discrepancies between observers in order to resolve disagreements or practicing with sample tapes to improve reliability be- fore viewing actual data tapes. This second idea was an elaboration on one stu- dent's comment that he "wished we could have watched the whole tape ffrst while reading the definitions and then dane the recording part.'/ The students also decided that the value of a high-power zoom lens should not be underestimated if one wants to observe detailed behaviors and remain unobtrusive. Overall, stu- dents' responses to the activity indicated that not only did they learn a great deal, but that they enjoyed the activity as well.A minor variation on this activity could allow students to discover for them- selves that one of the pitfalls to time sampling is that there wiil always be lost data (i.e., behaviors that occur during recording intervals rather than observation) intervals). Instead of having the entire class ijbserve and record during the same I intervals, divide the class in half, and have each half observe and record during I opposite intervals. Have each half of the class pool their data and calculate the I mean number of intervals in which tail shakes, feeding, grooming, display, ag-t gression, and submission were observed by their group. Students should find thatIfor behaviors that occur frequently, there will be little difference between the means reported by each half of the class. For example, the two halves of the class should be quite similar on mean number of tail shakes, simply because this occurs almost continuously among geese. Horlvever, for relatively infrequent behaviors, such as displays of agglession, students are likely to notice differences betweenRESEARcH METHoDS AND srATrsrlcs l59
￼Wnrrrruc Cotr,rporuerrreports by the two halves of the class. This can lead to a discussion of the relative usefulness of time sampling versus event sampling for observing infrequent be- haviors. (Obviously, if you use this alternative procedure and you still want stu- dents to calculate interobserver reliability, they must do so by pairing up with someone from the same half of the class.)Instructors who want to provide their students with an opportunity to do more writing than the small amount required to complete appendix C may add one of the following writing components to the activity.l. Have students reflect on their expectations of observation in general and time sampling in particular. AJter giving students a brief description of the exercise they are about to engage in, ask them to respond to the question, "What do you think will happen when we do this time sampling obser- vation?" After the exercise is complete, have students reread their earlier expectations and write a response to the following two questions: (a) "Which of your earlier expectations were met and why do you think this happened?" and (b) "Which of your earlier expectations were not met and why do you think this happened?" As a follow-up, students could construct a list on the chalkboard of the group's most common expectations, identify those that were not met/ and then discuss whether those unmet expecta- tions would make them more or less likely to want to use this method in their own future research.2. Have students write a report to the researchers who set up the study. In that report, students should point out the strengths and weaknesses of the study and suggest improvements. This writing component could be fol- lowed by a small-group discussion in which students compare the strengths and weaknesses they noticed and try to identify the most meth- odologically sound and practical suggestions for improvement. You could also ask the students to use this small-group time to rewrite the opera- tional deffnitions that they found lacking.3. Instructors who have their students keep journals might consider having them include an entry about this observation activity. Students could be asked to respond to the question "What do you feei you learned from this observation exercise?" If content analysis is covered in your course, you could have students use these journal responses as data and attempt to code them into categories.Bordens, K. S., &amp; Abbott, B. B. (19961.

CaudleThe College of Staten Island, City (Jniversity of New YorkThis activity provides a visual demonstration of the well-known limitation on information processing capacity represented by the C. A. Miller's phrase "the magical number seven, plus or minus two." Students are Presented with an. arrays of dots, arranged either randomly or in patterns. A graph of students' iudgments of the number of dots in each array demonstrates the limits of information pro- cessing capacity and the facilitative effect of chunking. The demonstration also provides opportunities to explore aspects of experimental design and descriptive statistics.CoNcrprThe phrase "magical number seven/ plus or minus two" refers to the limited capacity of short-term memory {Miller, 1956). This activity, unlike the auditory demonstrations typically included in introductory texts/ uses visual stimuli to demonstrate this capacity and the value of chunking. It easily can be extended to cover erperimental design and descriptive statistics.In addition to chalk and a chalkboard, you will need 17 stimulus items, each c-onstructed from a sheet of Stlz-by-Ll in. whitb paper and black or blue coiored adhesive dots approximately 3fo in. in diameter. These dots are available in office supply stores. A total of 136 dots are needed.Prepare the 17 stimulus items as indicated in appendix A. Each must consist of one sheet of paper with the number of dots indicated distributed either ran- domly or in a pattern. On the back of each sheet note lightly, for your own ref- erence, the stimulus item number as well as the number and distribution of the dots. This will enable you to check that the sheets are in the proper sequence before beginning the demonstration. -The construction of stimulus items as described here has proved adequate for classes of up to 90 students. For larger classes, you may want to construct the stimulus items by placing adhesive dots directly on overhead transparency sheets. These, however, are more difficult to handle. If you use this method, check in advance to make sure all the dots on each transparency actually project on the screen.You may also want to prepare a summary sheet that indicates the random stimulus item numbers in order of increasing number of dots (stimulus items 6, 3, 12, I, 16, 14,9, LL,5,4, 17,2,8, and 13) and the patterned item numbers inMEMORYr 189
￼the same order (stimulus items 15, 7, and 10). This will facilitate the construction of the results gaph.lNsrnucnoNs PreparationRrconorNc RrsulrsOn a table in front of you, arrange the stimulus items face down from Item I (on top) through Item 17 {on the bottom). Ask the class to turn to a blank page in their notebooks and number from line I through line 17.Say to the class: "I am going to show you some sheets of paper with dots on them. For each sheet, I wili give you three beats to get ready, one beat to watch, and one beat to write down the number of dots you see on that sheet. Write your answer for each sheet on a drfferent line, going from Line 1 through tine iZ. t will not be calling out line numbers, so just keep going until we finish. For each sheet, I wiil say, 'dah, dah, dah, look, write."' Demonstrate with hand motions how you will hold up a stimulus item on "look."Strmu/us PrcsentationShow each sheet by countin&amp; at approximately I sec per beat, "dah, dah, dah, look, write." As you say "look," hold up a stimulus item. As you say "write," put the sheet face down. Repeat for each stimulus item.Draw a graph on the chalkboard. Label the verticai axis "Number of Persons Correct" and mark it in units of 10. Label the horizontal axis "Number of Dots" and number it from I to 14 (the maximum number of dots).Referring to your summary sheet listing all the stimulus items, go through each item in the order of increasing dots and ask for a show of hands as to the number of students who wrote down the correct number. For examplet sayt "sheet 6 had one dot. How many of you were correct?" Follow this with, "Sheet 12, two dots," and so on. It is helpful to know in advance how many are actually present so you can subtract the number of people wrong when almost everyone is correct. With a large class, divide the class into sections and have someone count each section.Using this procedure, record the number of persons correctly responding to random arrangements of 1 through 14 dots. For each stimulus item, count the number of correct persons and plot a solid dot at the appropriate place on the graph. Connect the solid dots with solid lines to complete the graph. Then record the number of persons correctly responding to the three items with dots aranged in patterns. Indicate the number correct with small hollow circles and connect these with broken lines. Complete your graph with a key indicating that solid circles connected by a solid line correspond to random arrangements, whereas hollow circles connected with a broken line indicate pattern arrangements.Typicaily, for random arrangements of dots, virtually the entire class is correct for I through 5 dots. Thereafter, the number of persons correct begins to decline, and does so precipitously for 10 through 14 dots. Your graph will not be perfect, but the trend should be clearly apparent.Once you have constructed the graph for random arrangements, ask the class to interpret the graph. Identify the point where lots of people begin to makeDtscussroN190 IACTTVTflES HANDBOO&amp; VOL. 4

Askthe-class to compare the number correct for 9, lO, and 12 dots arranged in patternswith the number correct for 9, 10, and 12 dots distributed randomly..4sk forsuggestions as to why the results are as they are. Introduce the conceprof chunk-ing to explain the dramatic increase in capacity when information is organized into patterns.AJter discussing the main findings of the demonstration, you can extend theactivity by having students analyze it in terms of experimental design. Have themidentify the independent variables (there are two: the total numblr of dots andthe type of arrangement/ random or pattern) and the dependent variable (numberof persons correct) for the demonstration. Ask for someone to state a relationshipbetween the independent and dependent variables that was illustrated by thisactivity. (As the number of dots increased the number of persons corrett de-creased. However, the number of persons correct was higher when the dots were in a pattern.)Continuing your discussion of variables, ask the class to identify possible uncontrolled variables that might have affected the outcome. These mlglt lnctude such things as distance from the stimulus items, viewing angle, m&amp;ement of stimulus items as you held them up, inadvertent variations in viewing time, and so forth. Ask for suggestions as to how to adequately control for these variables, and describe laboratory instruments, such as the tachistoscope, that have been designed to enable increased control over such variables.Finally, it is good to point out how avery large number of individual responses (roughly 17 times the number of people who participated) can be summarized by means of a single graph. This illustrates the value of graphs and other forms of statistics for making dara manageable and understandable.Several writing exercises can be assigned to assess students, understanding ofinformation-processing capacity as illustrated by this activity. For example, -askthe students to wdte a paragraph summarizing the purpose of the demonstrationand describing the independent variable, the dependent variable, and the relation- ship between them.As a follow-up to the classroom discussion of uncontrolled. variables, you can also have students choose one of these variables and design an experiment in which it becomes an independent variable while other variables are controlled. Have students explain in writing how results could be summarized in a graph.Finally, have students write descriptions of situations in which chunt&lt;ing otvisual information into patterns is important. These might include occupat;ns{e.g., air traffic controller or musician), sports (e.g., football or basketballi boardgames (e.g., chess), and activities of daily iife (e.g., finding one,s car in a largeparking lot or ftnding items during a trip to a supermarket). In each instance, havestudents indicate why they believe chunking is of value. Some examples of studiesreporting visual chunking are noted in the Reference and Suggested Reading sec- tions.Miller, G. A. (1956).

At the bottom of the handout, there is space for the student to interpret the me_aning of Doris's dream. The dream is the same on each handout, but the description of Doris is not.CoNcrprMnrenrnls NerorolrustnucrrorusDrscussror.rThis activity is designed to help students understand that the interpretation of dreams, like the interpretation of other stimuli, can be influenced by prior knowl- edge, expectancies, motivation, emotion, and other top down processes. More spe- cificaliy, it illustrates how easily a clinician's prior knowledge-about a client might prompt very different conclusions about the meaning of dream content.This activity provides an easy way to show students the link between prin- ciples that guide the perception of objects and those that operate in social per- ception in general and in psychotherapy in particular.You will need copies of each of the three handouts given in appendixes A, B, and C. Collate the three items before you hand them out, so that one third of the students will receive each version.To aid class discussion of varying dream interpretations, it is helpful to have each version of Doris's demographics and life history on overhead transparencies in print large enough to be read from the back of the room.Give each student a version of the Doris handout. After a few minutes, ask the students to write their interpretation of the dream at the bottom-and perhaps the back-of the handout. You can either collect and read aloud some of the interpretations, or just ask students to read them aloud.As the readings proceed, it will soon become obvious to the class that something is amiss. At this point, reveal the differences in the three descriptions of Doris and point out the influence those differences had on the interpretations of Doris's dream.You can end this demonstration by pointing out that clinicians are aware of the role of prior knowledge in dream analysis (and other aspects of therapy). This is why, for example, they tend to base conclusions about clients on a series of dreams rather than on just one and why they seek to combine assessment infor- mation from various sources, such as tests and interviews. I have found that stim- ulating class discussions result {rom pointing out that, in spite of such efforts, clinicians are as vulnerable as the rest of us to the biasing effects of expectancy in dealing with clients.374 IACTTVTflES I{ANDBOO&amp; VOL. 4THE Rorp oF Pruon INronMATroNIN DnEem ANATYSISDouglas A.

            <Text> 	Overview of the conceptual issues at stake
In many ways, this is not a game about Psychology or Psychiatry, it is a game about the Philosophy of Science. This shouldn't really be surprising, as the history of the Psychology and Psychiatry is intimately linked to the history of the Philosophy of Science. Arguments made by Wundt, Freud, Watson, Hull Skinner and Miller all rely heavily on claims regarding what is or is not a legitimate scientific claim. This issues has not disappeared from undergraduate Psychological classroom either.  The APA's current guidelines for the Undergraduate Major in Psychology, published 2010, lists 10 learning outcomes for a major. The first is:
	Goal 1: Knowledge Base of Psychology
Demonstrate familiarity with the major concepts, theoretical perspectives, empirical findings, and historical trends in psychology
	Suggested Learning Outcomes
  1.1.	Characterize the nature of psychology as a discipline
  a)	Explain why psychology is a science.
  b)	Identify and explain the primary objectives of psychology: describing, understanding, predicting, and controlling behavior and mental processes.
  c)	Compare and contrast the assumptions and methods of psychology with those of other disciplines
  d)	Describe the contributions of psychology perspectives to interdisciplinary collaboration.
If the reader compares (b) to the definitions offered by the various historical figures in the 'Brief History of Psychology' in the gamebook, you will no doubt recognize the theoretical pluralism embodied in that statement.  My main for quoting this document is, however, (a).
The question if psychology is a science is a question of demarcation – the classic issue in the Philosophy of Science.  Answering why psychology is a science assumes a positive answer to the demarcation problem, and hence, a particular view in the Philosophy of Science.  Thus, Wundt charged Hebart with non-scientific investigations into introspection, because they did not adequately control the environment. Watson charged that McDougall's notion of behaviors having a 'purpose' was non-scientific, because they did not follow strict verificationism in the philosophy of science. When Hull charged that Tolman's explanations were unscientific because they positing internal entities, he did so by citing Newton (who, the critic would note, posited 'force', an invisible entity that was criticized at the time as an 'occult' power) (1935). Miller and Chomsky rejected Skinner's arguments by citing Philosophers of Science such as Patrick Suppes, who contend that the history of science shows that scientists do posit internal entities, if they can modeled.
Textbooks: A brief review of introductory textbooks in psychology demonstrates that the current crop of answers here is not good-

Many of the issues raised in the course of the game are appropriately philosophical.  While we've instructed the students to focus on the evidence, and its relationship with the claims asserted, one is often forced to notice how few of the great conflicts in the history of psychology and psychiatry are actually about the quality of the evidence presented. The conflicts are, most frequently, actually about whether the evidence in question can be considered 'scientific.' 
Some of these issues that will make an appearance in the game are:
	Is mental illness a disorder of an individual or a society? (i.e. are the entities studied in psychology individual humans or human societies?) -Clark, Albee, Szasz
	Is medical model an appropriate model for the classification, diagnostic criteria and treatment of mental disorders? Szasz, Albee v. Spitzer
	Related: Should mental disorders be classified in terms of their causes (etiology), or their symptoms? (psychoanalysts v. Spitzer)
	Are mental health norms defined in terms of statistical frequency of a given behavior in the population, or ideals of human behavior? (Anastasi v. Bieber)
	Is modeling / abductive reasoning a scientific method, or is science limited to explanations of observable behavior in terms of observable behavior? (cognitivists v. behaviorists)
	What are the responsibilities of scientists who study humans and human societies for social advocacy? (Chomsky, Skinner, Albee, Clark v. Tyler, Bieber)

            <Text> 	Major Events
 	Declassification
The declassification of homosexuality is assured.  The only characters who argue against it are Bieber and Socarides.  The NY Times obituary of Socarides quotes Gilbert Herdt of National Sexuality Resource Center in San Francisco as saying “Socarides outlived his time.” That is roughly correct. While it may not have occurred to many psychiatrists in 1971 that the classification of homosexuality was a problem for the homosexual community, once it was pointed out, the opinion swung: 58% of the population approved in 1973, and there is great embarrassment about that era today. 
As such, the main debate here is about the procedure by which homosexuality will be removed. Green and Marmor will be tempted to just ram it through the board of directors without consulting the population.  That should be avoided.  I've set up the game so that Marmor's original proposal should be remanded to the nomenclature committee, which will report in 1972, requiring a final vote of the membership in 1973.  While the result is not in doubt, without that process, Socarides' rhetoric that the decision was political, not scientific, will be bolstered.
 	DSM-III
The issue in the DSM-III is not the actual categories, but whether the categories should be based on the etiology or the observable symptoms.  At the same time, the Spitzer taskforce should propose a covering definition of 'mental illness' that will directly challenge the views of Szasz and Albee.  It should fail (it did, in reality). 

 	Fission
Members of the factions have the option to form splinter associations: the behaviorists found the “Society for the Experimental Analysis of Behavior” (actual founding 1957), and found two journals: Journal of the Experimental Analysis of Behavior and Journal of Applied Behavioral Analysis. Psychoanalysts form the American Psychoanalytic Association (actual founding in 1911, but grew rapidly in this era) and the journal Journal of the American Psychoanalytic Association (JAPA), and the Cognitivists form the Cognitive Science Society (1979) and its associated journals. 
No students are given direct instruction on whether the fission requires withdrawal from the APA. Some, esp. those playing Beiber and Socarides, may feel stronger about the fission than the cognitivists Miller and Chomsky.  This is historically appropriate–by the mid-1980s, cognitivism generally dominated the APA.  Contemporary behaviorism has adapted to resemble cognitivism in many ways, by include talk of 'motivations' and of the 'function of behavior' in their explanations.

If the game master chooses, he or she may introduce or encourage the development of a compromise position like the DSM-IV: 
… although this manual provides a classification of mental disorders, it must be admitted that no definition adequately specifies precise boundaries for the concept of ‘mental disorder.’ The concept of mental disorder, like many other concepts in medicine and science, lacks a consistent operational definition that covers all situations. All medical conditions are defined on various levels of abstraction--for example, structural pathology (e.g., ulcerative colitis), symptom presentation (e.g., migraine), deviance from a physiological norm (e.g., hypertension), and etiology (e.g., pneumococcal pneumonia). Mental disorders have also been defined by a variety of concepts (e.g., distress, dyscontrol, disadvantage, disability, inflexibility, irrationality, syndromal pattern, etiology, and statistical deviation). Each is a useful indicator for a mental disorder, but none is equivalent to the concept, and different situations call for different definitions.” 
With something like the 7 part definition included there in:

Features
	A a clinically significant behavioral or psychological syndrome or pattern that occurs in an individual
	B is associated with present distress (e.g., a painful symptom) or disability (i.e., impairment in one or more important areas of functioning) or with a significantly increased risk of suffering death, pain, disability, or an important loss of freedom
	C must not be merely an expeMillctable and culturally sanctioned response to a particular event, for example, the death of a loved one
	D a manifestation of a behavioral, psychological, or biological dysfunction in the individual
	E neither deviant behavior (e.g., political, religious, or sexual) nor conflicts that are primarily between the individual and society are mental disorders unless the deviance or conflict is a symptom of a dysfunction in the individual
Other Considerations
	F no definition adequately specifies precise boundaries for the concept of “mental disorder”
	G the concept of mental disorder (like many other concepts in medicine and science) lacks a consistent operational definition that covers all situations

            <Text> While there is a great deal to prepare for this game, my experience has taught me that the largest challenge the students will face is understanding that psychology and psychiatry were not always as they are now presented.  Most students come to the game believing that (a) psychology is a science and (b) psychiatry is a medical practice.  Both of those claims were not settled in the public mind in 1970.  In fact, most of the tension in this game revolves around the efforts to make psychiatry conform to 'the medical model' and psychology conform to the model of the natural sciences, thereby legitimizing them as worthwhile endeavors.
Psychology, on the other hand, had been suffering a crisis of legitimacy since its inception, which is why so many of their arguments are really metatheoretical arguments on the nature of science.  The behaviorists believe that introducing new methodologies, like the cognitivists propose, would further weaken their claims to be a scientific discipline. 
Generally speaking, our students come to psychology and psychiatry through textbooks. And as a result, they are primed to believe, unreflectively, that contemporary narrative of these disciplines is settled fact. Furthermore, these students know nothing of the rise and regularization of health insurance companies and billing procedures following the inception of Medicare and Medicade in 1965. For them, managed care, billable hours and check-box diagnoses have always been a part of their medical experience. It was not in 1970. Since the 1970s, the psychiatrists and clinical psychologists have been under extraordinary pressure to create a system of diagnosis that will allow them to be compensated for their work under this system. Spitzer's shift from etiological psychiatry to descriptive psychiatry was a major salvo in that struggle. 
It is difficult to get them to feel the pressure to legitimize psychiatry and psychology that drove much of the work in this era. But one can make progress by explicitly emphasizing the crisis of legitimacy before beginning the game.
Many of the stories of this period—especially those from the members of the Spitzer task force—recall a time of great confusion. Spitzer is often characterized as acting almost singlehandedly, ignoring the hard work that others put into the classifications they proposed. If students feel confused and overwhelmed with all of the proposals being brought forward and the changes being made, that is partially intentional. 
While I believe that the removal of homosexuality was the correct decision, both morally and scientifically, that does not mean that the dissenters who point out the political bullying that went into passing the resolutions do not have a point. I want the students to come away with the sense that this period in the history of psychology and psychiatry was an all out scramble for legitimacy. Creating a sense of confusion and chaos is a necessary part of that environment.

            <Text> 	Voting
I've left the issue of membership in the APA, and the right to vote on many of the main issues, intentionally vague. This is to allow for some flexibility for the instructor. The issue of who can practice mental health treatment is a game issue, realized in competing proposals in 1973.  As a corrollary then, the issue of membership in the APA may be brought forward. This can also play out as one of the causes of the great 'fission' that may occur starting in 1975.
The characters effected are Kameny, Gittings and Gold, who are not members of the APA.  If the gamemaster wants everyone to vote, he or she should make clear from the beginning that they are considered to be members of the APA with full rights to vote.

Actual history
Little Albert
Contrary to most textbooks that repeat the myth that 'Little Albert' was successfully deconditioned by Watson, was adopted by a family in North Baltimore and went on to live a long, happy, normal life; there is recent evidence to suggest that Little Albert died as a child. 
Using photographs from the family and FBI forensics experts, Beck et al. (2009) argue  that 'Little Albert' was likely Douglas Merritte, who died at age 6 of acquired hydrocephalus, after his mother had left Hopkins.  Watson never deconditioned Little Albert, and we simply have no evidence to determine if his conditioned fears remained until his death.  
See Beck, H. P., Levinson, S., &amp; Irons, G. (2009).  “Finding Little Albert: A Journey to John B. Watson’s Infant Laboratory.” American Psychologist, 64, 605-614. doi: 10.1037/a0017234. The authors conclude:
None of the folktales we encountered during our inquiry had a factual basis. There is no evidence that the baby's mother was 'outraged‚' at her son's treatment or that Douglas's phobia proved resistant to extinction. Douglas was never deconditioned, and he was not adopted by a family north of Baltimore.
Nor was he ever an old man. Our search of seven years was longer than the little boy's life. I laid flowers on the grave of my longtime 'companion' turned, and simultaneously felt a great peace and profound loneliness.

The APA's Monitor carried the story January 2010, 41(1): http://www.apa.org/monitor/2010/01/little-albert.aspx.
There were a number of blog posts that followed, including: http://mindhacks.com/2009/10/22/little-albert-lost-and-found/. 
Socarides &amp; Bieber
The dates I used in the introduction are not exact, although I've tried to remain faithful where I could. Part of the problem here is that many of the stories that are circulated, even by eyewitnesses, vary.  Ron Gold, for example, dates the events in Hawaii to 1972, but the APA records the 1972 conference in Dallas, and the Hawaii conference to 1973.  
The Dr. H. Anonymous speech actually happened in 1972 during a symposium titled “Psychiatry: Friend or Foe to Homosexuals: A Dialogue”. It also featured Kameny and Gittings in addition to John Fryer. In 1971, Kameny, Gittings and   The panel titled “Lifestyles of non-patient homosexuals,” which the participants joking referred to as “Lifestyles of impatient homosexuals.” It featured Larry Littlejohn of the Society for Individual Rights in San Francisco, Del Martin, a founder the Lesbian activist organization Daughters of Bilitis, Lilli Vincenz, another lesbian activists, and Jack Baker, the gay president-elect of the student body of the University of Minnesota.1 I've found a number of websites and personal stories that get these two distinct events confused. At the risk of perpetuating these confusions, I've combined them into a single event in 1971.
Socarides petitioned the New York District branch for hist task force on sexual deviation. It was granted, and his report filed in 1972.  The leadership rejected the report, on the grounds that its basis in psychoanalytic theory was unacceptable. 
Complicating matters is the existence of NARTH, which has been adopted by many on the religious right in recent years.  In 1995, Socarides gave an interview to the NY Times, promoting his book “Homosexuality: A Freedom Too Far - A Psychoanalyst Answers 1,000 Questions About Causes and Cure and the Impact of the Gay Rights Movement on American Society”, in which he claimed that the declassification occurred because of political pressure and not scientific evidence.  The themes of the interview will be familiar to anyone with even tangential knowledge of the rhetoric of the far right: persecution of conservatives, liberal media bias, gay agendas and conspiracies, etc.  His son, Richard Socarides, who is gay, became a gay activist, advised President Clinton on LGBT issues, and ultimately was elected to the presidency of the activist organization 'Equality Matters.'  That fact has lead many defenders of Socarides to accuse any press figure who mentions it of making an 'ad hominem' attacks against Socarides. 
NARTH continues today under the directorship of Socarides' student Nicolosi.
The UK Newspaper 'The Independent' ran a story in January 2010 by Patrick Strudwick about his experience in gay-to-straight conversion program inspired by Nicolosi. The story created a national concern about psychiatrists in the UK who still may be offering psychotherapy to 'treat' or 'cure' homosexuality. The story is available here: http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/features/the-exgay-files-the-bizarre-world-of-gaytostraight-conversion-1884947.html
Leona Tyler Principle / Goldwater Rule
Following the Goldwater affair, the American Psychiatric Association added  section7.3 to their The Principles of Medical Ethics With Annotations Especially Applicable to Psychiatry, which states:
On occasion psychiatrists are asked for an opinion about an individual who is in the light of public attention or who has disclosed information about himself/herself through public media. In such circumstances, a psychiatrist may share with the public his or her expertise about psychiatric issues in general. However, it is unethical for a psychiatrist to offer a professional opinion unless he or she has conducted an examination and has been granted proper authorization for such a statement.
This section has become known as 'The Goldwater Rule.' For a full history, see Mayer, John D. (2010) “The Goldwater Rule: The rationale of the Goldwater Rule” Psychology Today Blog (http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-personality-analyst/201005/the-goldwater-rule)
The American Psychological Association adopted  'Leona Tyler principle' was adopted in 1973 by the American Psychological Association, and still holds today. It states:
As citizens, members of the APA have the right to advocate for any cause through the myriad of political advocacy organizations, but when psychologists and psychiatrists speak for the profession through APA public stances and proclamations, it should be from science and professional experience.  

The principle was named for Leona Tyler simply because she was president at the time, not necessarily because she advocated for it, as she does in this game. 

Marr
David Marr joins Miller and Chomsky at MIT in 1977 and then dies in 1980 of Leukemia. His posthumously published book Vision is still standard reading in cognitive science courses.
Declassification
The story of the declassification of homosexuality as a mental illness has been retold a couple of times in recent years.  Famously, Alix Spiegel, grandson of John P. Spiegel, produced a version of the story for NPR's show 'This American Life'. The episode, named '81 words' is available online at http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/204/81-words. It is an excellent retelling of these events, and partially inspired this game. Ron Gold's retelling of the event is available here: http://www.queerstories.org/custom.html.
In the character sheet for Spitzer, I express some doubts about the standard story told by Spiegel, because Spitzer's timing and motivation for inserting himself into the controversy doesn't seem to match up for normal person. In a 2005 issue of The New Yorker Magazine, Spiegel writes that 
Despite Spitzer’s genius at describing the particulars of emotional behavior, he didn’t seem to grasp other people very well. Jean Endicott, his collaborator of many years, says, “He got very inv.ved with issues, with ideas, and with questions. At times he was unaware of how people were responding to him or to the issue. He was surprised when he learned that someone was annoyed. He’d say, ‘Why was he annoyed? What’d I do?’” After years of confrontations, Spitzer is now aware of this shortcoming, and says that he struggles with it in his everyday life. “I find it very hard to give presents,” he says. “I never know what to give. A lot of people, they can see something and say, ‘Oh, that person would like that.’ But that just doesn’t happen to me. It’s not that I’m stingy. I’m just not able to project what they would like.” Frances argues that Spitzer’s emotional myopia has benefitted him in his chosen career: “He doesn’t understand people’s emotions. He knows he doesn’t. But that’s actually helpful in labeling symptoms. It provides less noise.”2
If this is correct, my argument about the implausibility of the Chair of the Nomenclature Committee attending Socarides' speech in New York without expectation of a demonstration may be wrong. I leave it in, because a student playing the part needs to think himself or herself into Spitzer's position, not his particular characteristics—and whatever unique mind Robert Spitzer has, it is probably uncommon in undergraduates.
Spitzer Task force
 See ch 3 of  Kutchins &amp; Kirk (2003) Making Us Crazy.  
Homdysphilia was proposed by Spitzer without consultation with the subcommittee on human sexuality.  Green sent Spitzer a strongly worded criticism of both the classification and the method Sptizer used to introduce it and resigns in protest.  Spitzer constructs a 'survey' instrument that he sends out to the entire taskforce and finds that there isn't enough agreement on the issue to leave it with the subcommittee, and presents the idea to the entire taskforce, thus outmaneuvering Green. The committee narrowly approves 'ego-dystonic homosexuality', but isn't thrilled. Judd Marmor, who voted in favor, writes later that he would have preferred no mention of homosexuality, but politics required it.
Averson Therapy
(from wikipedia) Since 1994, the American Psychological Association has declared that aversion therapy is a dangerous practice that does not work.[citation needed] Since 2006, the use of aversion therapy to treat homosexuality has been in violation of the codes of conduct and professional guidelines of the American Psychological Association and American Psychiatric Association. The use of aversion therapy to treat homosexuality is illegal in some countries. The standard in psychotherapy in America and Europe is currently Gay Affirmative Psychotherapy. Guidelines for Gay Affirmative Psychotherapy can be found by APA. [4]

From Issues in Psychotherapy with Lesbian and Gay Men: A Survey of Psychologists. Linda Garnets, Los Angeles, CA Kristin A. Hancock, Berkeley, CA Susan D. Cochran, California State University, Northridge Jacqueline Goodchilds, University of California, Los Angeles Letitia Anne Peplau, University of California, Los Angeles. Report of the APA. http://search.apa.org/search?facet=classification%3aSexuality||classification%3aTherapy&amp;query=Aversion%20Therapy
In 1975, the American Psychological Association (APA) took a strong stance regarding bias toward lesbians and gay men, resolving that homosexuality per se implies no impairment in judgment, reliability or general social and vocational abilities (see Appendix A for the full text of the resolution). The APA urged psychologists to take the lead in removing the stigma of mental illness long associated with homosexual orientations (Conger, 1975). In recent years, attention has been drawn to ways in which a client's ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, or physical disability can affect clinical judgment and treatment strategies. There has been a corresponding effort to develop guidelines to help practitioners avoid bias in psychotherapy (APA, 1975). Recognizing that practice does not spontaneously or quickly follow policy changes, the Committee on Lesbian and Gay Concerns (CLGC), sponsored jointly by the Board of Social and Ethical Responsibility in Psychology (BSERP) and the Board of Professional Affairs (BPA), formed a task force in 1984 to investigate the range of bias that may occur in psychotherapy with lesbians and gay men. This article is an abridged report of the task force's research, findings, and recommendations.

Reparative therapy
rejected repeatedly by the APA, most recently in 2008.
Evelyn Hooker
E. Hooker was given 1991 Award for Distinguished Contribution to Psychology in the Public Interest, presented by the American Psychological Association. The citation read:

"When homosexuals were considered to be mentally ill, were forced out of government jobs, and were arrested in police raids, Evelyn Hooker courageously sought and obtained research support from the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) to compare a matched sample of homosexual and heterosexual men. Her pioneering study, published in 1957, challenged the widespread belief that homosexuality is a pathology by demonstrating that experienced clinicians using psychological tests widely believed at the time to be appropriate could not identify the nonclinical homosexual group. This revolutionary study provided empirical evidence that normal homosexuals existed, and supported the radical idea then emerging that homosexuality is within the normal range of human behavior. Despite the stigma associated with homosexuality, she received an NIMH Research Career Award in 1961 to continue her work. In 1967, she became chair of the NIMH Task Force on Homosexuality, which provided a stamp of validation and research support for other major empirical studies. Her research, leadership, mentorship, and tireless advocacy for an accurate scientific view of homosexuality for more than three decades has been an outstanding contribution to psychology in the public interest."

A Re-analysis of the Reliability of Psychiatric Diagnosis
Introduction
Classification systems such as diagnosis have two primary properties, reliability and validity. Reliability refers to the consistency with which subjects are classified; validity, to the utility of the system for its various purposes. In the case of psychiatric diagnosis, the purposes of the classification system are communication about clinical features, aetiology, course of illness and treatment. A necessary constraint on the validity of the system is its reliability. There is no guarantee that a reliable system is valid, but assuredly an unreliable system must be invalid.
Background
Studies of the reliability of psychiatric diagnosis provide information on the upper limits of its validity. This study will consider some of the difficulties in appraising diagnostic reliability, offers a re-analysis of the available data from the literature, and suggests a possible course of action to improve psychiatric diagnosis.
Rationale
Zubin (1967) reviewed the major studies of reliability of psychiatric diagnosis performed until 1966. He noted that diagnostic reliability is referred to in three different ways: agreement between independent diagnosticians examining the same patients, stability in diagnosis over time, and similarity in diagnostic frequencies for comparable samples. It is the first sense—interjudge agreement—that is fundamental.
Recent studies of interjudge agreement of psychiatric (Schmidt and Fonda, 1956; Kreitman, 1961; Beck et al., 1962; Sandifer et al., 1964) report on agreement as to the presence of absence of a diagnosis, but they neglect to consider the rate at which diagnoses are made.
Cohen (1960) has recently developed a statistical measure (called 'kappa') of interjudge agreement that incorrporates a correction for chance agreement. This study proposes to recalculate the reliability of psychiatric diagnosis from these studies based on Cohen's Kappa.
Experimental Design
The study will use existing data, culled from five recent papers measuring the interjudge agreement of psychiatric diagnosis.
Significance and Contributions
There is little doubt that the reliability of psychiatric diagnosis is being questioned at this time. If the presumed agreement of previous work depends merely on the rate of chance agreement, psychiatry must reevaluate it classification system immediately.

 Emotional responses in a human child.
Background: Many psychologists--Freud included--have held, with little evidence in support, that the human mind is built on a variety of instincts, such as self-preservation, sexual activity, etc. Emotional responses to fearful stimuli, such as rats and spiders, is commonly considered to be innate, possibly as a result of evolutionary pressures to avoid infectious or poisonous creatures.  This experiment seeks to condition a fear-response in a human infant, thus establishing that there is no need for theoretical innate entities in our explanation of emotion in humans.
Rationale: The success of Pavlov's work conditioning reflex responses to novel stimuli in canines has shown that behaviors previously believed to be instinctual are likely to have resulted from conditioning.  The current experiment seeks to determine if that insight can be extended to humans, by conditioning a emotional response in a child—fear—that is widely believed to be instinctual. Demonstrating that these reflexes can appear without appeal to 'instinct' or 'adaptation' undermines the need for theoretically innate entities in our understanding of human behavior.
Experimental Design: A child of a single destitute mother, currently employed as a wet nurse at a local hospital (Hopkins), has been recruited for the experiment. Given the nature of his mother's employment, the child is familiar with the clinical setting of a hospital, and hence an ideal subject for this experimental protocol. Previous work with this subject at the age of 8 months has demonstrated that he exhibits fear-like responses to loud sounds: the experimenter stood behind the subject, outside of eye sight and struck a steel bar with a hammer. On the first presentation, the subject startled and raised his hands. On the second, he began to tremble. On the third, he cried and seemed to be having a fit.
The experimenter proposes the following:
At 9 months of age, we will present the subject with (randomly): a white rat, a rabbit, a dog, a monkey, with masks with and without hair, cotton wool, and burning newspapers. Given the child's upbringing, it is unlikely that he has ever encountered any of these objects before.  We expect him to have no emotional response to any of them, but if he responds, that object will be removed from the study before proceeding.
At the age of 11 months, one of the objects will be presented to him again. When he moves towards contact with the object, the experimenter will make the loud noise already established as causing a fear reaction.  Each movement towards the stimulus object will cause another loud noise stimulus.  Once the fear reaction is well conditioned, the experimenter will present the subject with the fear-conditioned object and record the response.  The child's reaction than will be compared with other similarly-aged children's reaction for typicality of fear-reactions in children.
The fear-conditioned object will be reintroduced over the subsequent weeks and months at regular intervals to determine the persistence of the conditioned response. 
Significance and Contribution
This research has the potential to experimentally confirm or deny the commonly held belief that the fear response is innate, or at least instinctual. Pavlov's experiments with classical conditioning in dogs has shown that reflexes that were previously believed to be instinctual—such as salivation—could be conditioned in response to novel stimuli. If Pavlov's approach is to be applied to humans, it is incumbent that psychologists determine the existence and nature of human instinctual reactions, and if they can be conditioned like those of the canine.

If the gamemaster wishes to make a point about the influence of psychopharmacology and health insurance companies in the development of the DSM-III, he or she may wish to make use of the 'Exhibits' included in the “Call for papers and symposia” and hang up posters advertising Miltown,   Tofranil, Librium and Valium. There are a great number of blogs and websites dedicated to storing and distributing these historical images. Here are a few:
	Miltown: http://www.homemakerblush.com/miltown-a-piece-of-1950s-homemaker-history/
	Tofranil: http://adpharm.net/blog/?s=tofranil

Valium: http://faculty.weber.edu/ewalker/Medicinal_Chemistry/topics/Psycho/psycho.htm (look for 'Valium Ads', there are three links).

At the same time,  we should remember that Medicare and Medicade were created in 1965, and the health insurance industry was being rev.utionized at this time.

As citizens, members of the APA have the right to advocate for any cause through the myriad of political advocacy organizations, but when psychologists and psychiatrists speak for the profession through APA public stances and proclamations, it should be from science and professional experience. 
On occasion psychiatrists are asked for an opinion about an individual who is in the light of public attention or who has disclosed information about himself/herself through public media. In such circumstances, a psychiatrist may share with the public his or her expertise about psychiatric issues in general. However, it is unethical for a psychiatrist to offer a professional opinion unless he or she has conducted an examination and has been granted proper authorization for such a statement.
	Hospital Privileges for Psychologists POSITION STATEMENT  (1974)
Approved by the Board of Trustees, December 1970
This statement was prepared by the Committee on Psychiatry and Psychology.

Because of professional and legal considerations, the ultimate medical responsibility for patients admitted to hospitals should remain with licensed physicians. Psychologists, like other nonmedical professionals, should be eligible for some type of hospital appointment

	Affirmative Action POSITION STATEMENT
Approved by the Board of Trustees, December 1977 Approved by the Assembly of District Branches, October 1977
This statement was prepared by the Committee of Black Psychiatrists1 and recommended by the Council on National Affairs 
THERE IS a continuous need to increase the number of minority psychiatrists; the American Psychiatric Association has consistently demonstrated its commitment to the principle of affirmative action as reflected in its efforts of recruitment and training of minority psychiatrists. APA has previously developed and instituted policies recognizing and supporting the special mental health issues of minority populations; however, there are serious threats to affirmative action programs that have facilitated the following endeavors: APA reaffirms these commitments and policies by 1) issuing a public statement drawing attention to the potential deleterious effects that such threats pose to the delivery of health services to minority groups; 2) actively participating with other professional and educational groups to assure continued recruitment and training of minority candidates in medical disciplines; and 3) further exploring and developing, through its appropriate components, mechanisms to assure continued implementation of these commitments. 


 	Research committee Issues
Unless otherwise noted, these should be brought to the research committee for discussion by the gamemaster.  If Milgram and Zimbardo are not in the game, those will need to be brought as well. The actual papers should be made available to the students who will be presenting the data, if the activities are not actually performed (they are on http://www2.mcdaniel.edu/pbradley/reacting/).
1971: 
	Shepard &amp; Metzler's 'mental rotation of three-dimensional objects' task is already approved, the task should be presented to the students, and Miller prepped on presenting the data (you'll have to register for an account here: http://opl.apa.org/Experiments/About/AboutMentalRotation.aspx), 
	Siegelman “Adjustment of Homosexual and Heterosexual Women” (likely approve) (proposed by Barbara Gittings, if in game, if not, gamemaster)
	Watson (1920). “Conditioned Emotional Reactions” http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Watson/emotion.htm* (likely reject) (proposed by gamemaster)
1972: 
	Rosehan (1973). “On being sane in insane places” 
	Fordney Settlage (1973). [citation DS Fordney Settlage, Baroff S, Cooper D 1973. Sexual experience of younger teenage girls seeking contraceptive assistance for the first time.

1973:  
	Zimbardo [full citation is Haney, Banks &amp; Zimbardo (1973).] (propsed by zimbardo, if in game, if not, gamemaster) (likely approve, will need to rewrite Ethical guidelines as result)

*Students may recognize this experiment, although I don't use the name 'little albert' in the description. They will also probably find the experiment unethical.  Many people do.  It is important not to salve that response with the standard myth that Watson deconditioned Albert after the experiment: there is no evidence that he did, or that he ever intended to. Thus, my version of the proposed experiment contains no plan for deconditioning Albert. See the 'Actual History' section below for citations.
**1973-1974: Spitzer proposes to calculate Cohen's Kappa for existing measures of reliability of psychiatric diagnosis. If the student is skilled in basic statistics, and has access to the medical literature, he or she should be encouraged to replicate the study. If this is an intro-level class without statistics, the student can present a research report of the actual study, which is available via pubmed DOI 10.1192/bjp.125.4.341
Of course, Little Albert and Rosehan cannot be completed by actual students. If the research committee approves those experiments, the instructor should charge a student with presenting the original papers during the follow years' conference.
 	Activities
Various students should be tasked with presenting proposals for research to the research committee, conducting that research if it is chosen, and presenting the findings at the following conference.  Not everything proposed can be carried out in an undergraduate classroom. Where it is impossible, the instructor should distribute the actual paper for evaluation as if it had been carried out. The instructors is, of course, encouraged to use classroom activities with which he or she is familiar. 
I've pulled a number of experiments from the APA's Activities Handbook for the Teaching of Psychology v. 1-4 that correspond to many of the topics the class will be discussing. They are listed here, and attached as PDFs at the end of this document, if you do not have access to the Handbooks. The characters listed here are suggestions.  The instructor should distribute these as he or she sees fit.
Note: Milgram and Zimbardo, if they are in the game, are directly instructed to propose experiments to the research committee ('small world' and 'prison' respectively). Spitzer and Fordney Settlage also have instructions to present studies based on their character's actual work.

**1973-1974: Spitzer proposes to calculate Cohen's Kappa for existing measures of reliability of psychiatric diagnosis. If the student is skilled in basic statistics, and has access to the medical literature, he or she should be encouraged to replicate the study. If this is an intro-level class without statistics, the student can present a research report of the actual study, which is available via pubmed DOI 10.1192/bjp.125.4.341
Of course, Little Albert and Rosehan cannot be completed by actual students. If the research committee approves those experiments, the instructor should charge a student with presenting the original papers during the follow years' conference.

Interpersonal Dynamics in a Simulated Prison
Background
After he had spent four years in a Siberian prison the great Russian novelist Dostoevsky commented, surprisingly, that his time in prison had created in him a deep optimism about the ultimate future of mankind because, as he put it, if man could survive the horrors of prison life he must surely be a “creature who could withstand anything.” In the century which has passed since Dostoevsky’s imprisonment, little has changed to render the main thrust of his statement less relevant. Although we have passed through periods of enlightened humanitarian reform, in which physical conditions within prisons have improved somewhat and the rhetoric of rehabilitation has replaced the language of punitive incarceration., the social institution of prison has continued to fail. On purely pragmatic grounds, there is substantial evidence that prisons neither “rehabilitate” nor act as deterrent to future crime—in America, recidivism rates upwards of 75% speak quite decisively to these criteria. On humanitarian grounds as well prisons have failed: our mass media are increasingly filled with accounts of atrocities committed daily, man against man, in reaction to the penal system or in the name of it. The prison undeniably creates, almost to the point of cliché, an intense hatred and disrespect in most inmates for the authority and the established order ot society into which they will eventually return. And the toll which it takes on the deterioration of human spirit for those who must administer it, as well as for those upon whom it is inflicted is incalculable.
Rationale
Attempts to provide an explanation of the deplorable condition of our penal system and its dehumanizing effects upon prisoners and guards, often focus upon what might be called the dispositional hypothesis. While this explanation is rare expressed explicitly, it is central to a prevalent non-conscious ideology: that the state of the social institution of the prison is due to the “nature” of the people who administer it, or the “nature” of the people who populate it, or both. That is, a major contributing cause to despicable conditions, violence, brutality, dehumanization and degradation exisitng with any prison can be traced to some innate or acquired characteristic of the correctional and inmate population.
The dispositional hypothesis has been embraced by the proponents of the prison status quo (blaming conditions on the evil in the prisoners), as well as by its critics (attributing the evil to guards and staff with their evil motives and deficient personality structures).  A critical evaluation of the dispositional hypothesis cannot be made directly through observation in existing prison settings, since such naturalistic observation necessarily confounds the acute effects of the environment with the chronic characteristics of the inmate and guard populations. TO separate the effects of the prison environment per se from those attributable to a priori dispositions of its inhabitants requires a research strategy in which a “new” prison is constructed, comparable in its fundamental social-psychological milieu to existing prison systems, bt entirely populated by individuals whoa re undifferentiated in all essential dimensions form the rest of soceity.
Experimental Design
Interpersonal dynamics in a prison environment are to be studied experimentally by designing a functional simulation of a prison in which subjects role-pay prisoners and guards for an extended period of time. To assess the power of the social forces on the emergent behavior in this situation, alternative explanations in terms of pre-existing dispositions are to be eliminated through subject selection. A homogeneous, “normal” sample is to be chosen after extensive interviewing and diagnostic testing of a large group of volunteer male college students. Half of the subjects are to be randomly assigned to role-play prison guards for eight hours each day, while the others role-play prisoners incarcerated for nearly one fill week. Neither group will receive any specific training in these roles. The primary investigator will role-play the prison warden, and consultants from the real prison population (both prisoners and prison officials) will be recruited to assist in the planning and implementation of the prison environment.
Continuous, direct observation of behavioral interactions will be supplemented by video-taped recording, questionnaires, self-report scales and interviews. All these data sources are likely to converge on the conclusion that this simulated prison will develop into a psychologically compelling prison environment.
Significance and Contributions
The authors believe that this demonstration will reveal new dimensions in the social psychology of imprisonment worth pursuing in future research, In addition, this research will provide a paradigm and information base for studying alternatives to existing guard training, as well as for questioning the basic operating principles o which penal institutions rest. There is great need today for prison reforms that recognize the dignity and humanity of both prisoners and guards whoa re constantly forced into one of the most intimate and potentially deadly encounters known to man. This study has the potential to inform those reforms.

GreiderThis activit5r is designed to increase student familiarity with the ways in which defense mechanisms are used. In addition to being a good teaching tool, the activity allows for the expression of a considerable amount of creativity on the part of the students' Defense mechanisms covered include regression, rationalization, repression, projection, fantasy, compensation, identification, and reaction formatjon.Ask for eight student volunteers for a role-playing exercise' I usually choose four males and four females, since I have found mixed pairs to work best in this activity. Have these eight students leave the room and go with them to explain what they are to do. First group them in male-female pairs and assign two of the defense mechanisms to each pair. Instruct each pair of students to make up two skits, one for each of the mechanisms. I usually allow them about 15 minutes to prepare their skits. While they are working, go back into the room, list the defense mechanisms on the chalkboard, and discuss each one briefly with the class. Then call the role players back into the room to put on their skits. Have each pair perform one of their two skits, and after going through the pairs have each pair do their second skit. The job of t]le class is to guess which mechanism each skit represents.In discussion you can point out the place of defense mechanisms in personality theory. You should comment on the role of defense mechanisms in normal functioning. When are these mechanisms helpfi:l? When are tlrey harmfr.rl? Conduct an anonyrnous survey of your students asking them to indicate whether or not they have used any of the defense mechanisms during the past year. Do they use some defense mechanisms more tltan others? If so, which ones?Clum, G. A., &amp; Clum, J. Mood variability and defense mechanism preference.
