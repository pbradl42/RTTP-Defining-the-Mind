### Brief History of the Study of Homosexuality in America

While homosexual behavior has appeared throughout human history, the notion of homosexuality as an “orientation” or “personality” is relatively recent.  The etymology of the word 'homosexual' itself shows the intimate connection between the idea of sexual orientation and the history of psychiatry.  According to the OED, the term first appears in print in English in C. G. Chaddock translation of R. von Krafft-Ebing 1892 *Psychopathia Sexualis*. Relevant sections are reproduced in Appendix &lt;!--\ref{app: KraftEbbing1}--&gt;.

The idea of homosexuality as a lifestyle connected to personality is, in the English speaking world at least, indelibly linked to the public persona of the author Oscar Wilde. While he was studying classics at Oxford, he began advocating aestheticism, the view that aesthetic values trump moral or social values in the understanding of art and literature. Wilde parlayed his success as a playwright into fame, cultivating a flamboyant public personal, known for dressing immaculately and flamboyantly, entertaining wealthy society women and having a sharp wit and his talent at dinner conversation. His masterwork ‘The Portrait of Dorian Gray’ plays with this persona in the characters of XX and Gray himself.

 In 1895, he and his companion Alfred Taylor were convicted of acts of 'gross indecency' and sentenced to two years hard labor. Their trial was 'the trial of the century' in the English upper-class, and to this day, many of Wilde's personal characteristics inform the common stereotypes of homosexual men, for example, fastidiousness with respect to personal appearance, extraordinary wittiness and social adeptness, esp. with upper-class women, are all traceable to Wilde himself.

The next fifty years were not kind to gay folks.  “Treatments” for homosexuals included surgical interventions such as castration, vasectomies, lobotomies, sterilization, clitoridectomies, hysterectomies; chemical interventions such as sexual stimulants, depressants, hormonal injections, and pharmacological shock; psychological interventions included adjustment therapy, psychoanalysis, hypnosis, aversion therapy that included electric shock and desensitization; and social psychological interventions patterned on Alcoholics Anonymous like 'Homosexuals Anonymous' and others.

One of the saddest stories of this era is that of Alan Turing, who was mentioned in the section above on &lt;!--\ref{concurrentdevelopments:logicandcomputing} on page \pageref{concurrentdevelopments:logicandcomputing}--&gt;. Turing was one of the greatest mathematicians and logicians of his era, if not the greatest. During WWII, he worked at Bletchley park as one of Churchill's famed code-breakers. His efforts in breaking the German codes lead directly to the development of modern logic and the invention of the electronic computer. He is generally considered to be the founder of both modern cryptography and computer science. While working at Princeton, he became friends with Claude Shannon, who is now recognized as the father of information theory. Quite literally, Turing is to the contemporary information age what Newton was to the age of mechanics, or Einstein the nuclear age.

But Turing was also gay. In 1952, he was prosecuted and convicted for being a homosexual. Sentenced to hormone therapy and stripped of his military clearance (remember, during WWII, he was directly responsible for breaking the German code, created the encryption for the Washington-DC phone line, and was privy to the highest secrets of the war), he committed suicide on June 7th, 1954. In 2009, the British Government started a program of accepting online petitions from citizens of the UK. One of the first to be submitted, and promoted by Richard Dawkins, was a call for an official apology to Alan Turing for unjust prosecution. On 10 September 2009, Prime Minister Gordon Brown issued a formal apology to Alan Turing, stating:

&gt; It is thanks to men and women who were totally committed to fighting fascism, people like Alan Turing, that the horrors of the Holocaust and of total war are part of Europe’s history and not Europe’s present. So on behalf of the British government, and all those who live freely thanks to Alan’s work I am very proud to say: we’re sorry, you deserved so much better.


During this dark period of persecution, advocates for homosexuals (at this time called 'homophile' organizations) focused primarily on changing the stereotypes of the homosexual as a step towards ending the criminalization of homosexual acts as well as the psychological and medical 'treatments.'  There was little activity within the scientific and academic communities on the issue. 

That all started to change when a young social psychologist named Evelyn Hooker started teaching at UCLA.

During WWII, young men and women who were accused of homosexuality in Pacific theater of operations tended to be discharged from the military in California ports, including San Diego, Long Beach and San Francisco. Many, if not most, of these young people could not return to their hometowns because of their dishonorable discharge from the military. As a result, a organic community of homosexuals began taking shape in many of these cities.

While teaching at UCLA, Hooker became friends with one of her graduate students, Sam Fromm. Sam was gay. In 1943, he challenged her to study 'people like him' to determine if they were mentally ill (specifically 'neurotic') independently of the biases against homosexuality inherent in the psychiatric tradition. In a 1998 interview, Hooker explained the significance of this phrase:

 &gt; “This bright young man, somewhere in his early thirties, had obviously been thinking about this for a long time. And by ‘people like us’ he meant, ‘We’re homosexual, but we don’t need psychiatrists. We don’t need psychologists. We’re not insane. We’re not any of those things they say we are.” (Eric Marcus, Windy City Times, October 31, 2007 • vol 23 no 07)

During the 1940s, Evelyn Hooker became a trusted 'outsider' of the gay community in L.A., but didn't want to conduct research on people she saw as her friends.

#### The Kinsey Report

In 1948, Alfred C. Kinsey (b. 1894 – d. August 25, 1956) published *Sexual Behavior in the Human Male*. It was revolutionary.

Kinsey and his assistants had interviewed 5,300 white males from all walks of American life. The interviews required up to 521 questions, depending on the interviewee’s experiences.  Kinsey reported that a large number of men—up to 45%—reported having at least one homosexual encounter during his adolescence.  These encounters are most frequent at young age, dropping to a stable 10% of the population by age 20-25. These numbers, Kinsey fears, may not tell the whole story because:

&gt;The social significance of the homosexual is considerably emphasized by the fact that both Jewish and Christian churches have considered this aspect of human sexuality to be abnormal and immoral. … Social custom and our Anglo-American law are sometimes very severe in penalizing one who is discovered to have had homosexual relations. In consequence, many persons who have had such experiences are psychically disturbed, and not a few of them have been in open conflict with the social organization. [p. 610][#Kinsey:1998ur]

The Kinsey report found that homosexual activity as a common part of male sexual development.  Self-identifying as a homosexual, or engaging exclusively in homosexual activity, was found to be more rare. But at 10%, it was almost twice as high as any previous scientific estimate. Almost as importantly, Kinsey identified the source of psychic disturbance *not* to be the homosexual activity itself, but the social structures that penalize such behavior.

#### Early 'Homophile' movements

\end{marginfigure}
--&gt;

Two years after the publication of the Kinsey report, a group of 'homophile' activists founded the Mattachine society, which is now generally recognized as the first national gay-rights organization.

 The Mattachine society, named for a European tradition of theater masks, sought to change the prevailing view of homosexuality by presenting the membership as no different than the mainstream heterosexual society. Its members dressed in suits and skirts, and showed no 'outward signs' of homosexuality. These 'outward signs' are, of course, those stereotypes we identified earlier as originating with Oscar Wilde. Mattachine society demonstrations---held annually in front of Independence Hall in Philadelphia on July 4th---were sober affairs of men in gray suits and women in dresses walking up and down in straight lines, conspicuously *not* holding hands or being affectionate to one another. When couples held hands, one of the leaders of the Mattachine society, Frank Kameny, famously scolded “None of that!”  See the "Rules for Picketting" published by the Mattachine Society in Figure &lt;!--\ref{fig: MattachineRules}--&gt;



At the same time, a secret social club for Lesbians called The Daughters of Bilitis was founded in San Francisco  by Del Martin and Phyllis Lyon. To stay in touch with its members they created a magazine called 'The Ladder', which came under the editorship of Barbara Gittings in 1963. The magazine flourished under Gittings' direction, growing from a simple hand-stapled newsletter to a true 40-page magazine. Gittings became a leader, along with Frank Kameny, of the Mattachine society.

#### Connecting these threads: Evelyn Hooker

After the publication of the Kinsey report, Hooker finally decided to meet Fromm's challenge. She designed an experiment to determine if homosexuals were mentally disturbed.  In 1954, she received a grant from the National Institute on Mental Health to run her study. She recruited 30 homosexuals from the Mattachine society as well as the gay community generally. An equal number of heterosexual men were recruited from civil organizations around the L.A.. Individuals in the groups were matched with respect to age, IQ and education level. All people currently in therapy for mental health were excluded from the study.  

This alone was a major step forward in the study of male homosexuality, as all previous psychological studies had found their subjects in psychiatric wards, army barracks or clinical settings. By studying only those already in psychiatric treatment, one cannot separate traits that may signify an underlying condition from traits that result from the psychiatric treatment itself.

Hooker tested the resulting 60 men using standard psychological tests: the Rorschach, Thematic Apperception Test (TAT) and the Make-A-Picture-Story Test (MAPS). The data was blinded and mixed, and then sent to psychologists with expertise on these the tests who were instructed to score them normally and return the scores.  Hooker found no significant difference between the 30 homosexual and 30 heterosexual males with respect to standard tests for mental disturbances, indicating that homosexual men were no more likely to be neurotic than equivalent heterosexual men.

Hooker presented her findings at the 1956 APA in Chicago. Her paper was published in 1957, shortly after Sam Fromm's death in a car accident. For more on Evelyn Hooker, see [#Aldrich:2005wq]

#### Stonewall: The street activists


By the 1960s, tensions were growing in the gay community. Another group of younger gay activists were growing irritated with both the slow progress of the Mattachine society and its restrictions on behavior. In 1968, a group of young 'street-activists' disrupted a meeting of the American Medical Association in New York by shouting down Charles Socarides, a Psychiatrist known for his psychoanalytic treatment of homosexuals.

But everything changed forever on Saturday, June 28, 1969 at 1:20 AM, when the police raided the Stonewall Inn in Greenwich Village. These raids were common---the police would arrest everyone, roughing people up, and generally intimidating the population.  But this time, the gay and lesbian patrons of the Stonewall resisted. Events escalated. The riots that followed lasted until Wednesday night, July 3rd. 
&lt;!--\begin{marginfigure}

\end{marginfigure}
--&gt;

On July 4th, the gay community’s attention turned to Independence Hall in Philadelphia and the Mattachine society’s annual march. As usual, Frank Kameny and Barbara Gittings, long time leaders of that gay and lesbian advocacy group, required the women to wear skirts and men suits. But the tide had turned. The young protestors from Stonewall would not conform. Kameny’s approach of assimilation  to “straight” behavior had been surpassed by the direct action begun at Stonewall. Militant groups such as the Gay Liberation Front and the Gay Activist Alliance sprouted up overnight (both started in New York). Plans were made to confront those who continued to classify homosexuality as a mental disorder, and directly challenge those who continued to treat homosexuals using barbaric methods.

Those plans included San Francisco, site of the 1970 American Psychiatric Association’s annual convention. And you already know what happened there. (See &lt;--\fullref{prolouge}--&gt; if you need a refresher).

            <Comments>In Victorian England, 'gross indecency' was defined as sexual acts between men that did not rise to the level of 'buggery'.
There is a superb website in the UK that is collecting stories of patients, doctors and nurses from this era. All are deeply disturbing, some downright terrifying.  See http://treatmenthomosexuality.co.uk/.  I'll quote just one example here, as it so perfectly illustrates classical conditioning:
“We need to remember that the discussions that went on at Maudsley in the early 50s were constantly searching for ways in which we could understand the relationship between events, so again referring to the ideas put forward by Pavlov, Skinner and Wolpe, if a situation produces anxiety and at the same time there is another even occurring then buy the process of conditioning it's quite likely that the reaction of  anxiety will become associated with the unconditioned stimulus. By thinking along those lines it seemed to me that if the process of sexual arousal and gratification is linked with something, it may well become the preferred method of seeking gratification. It seemed to me that if a person wanted to stop being involved in and interested in make figures—so long as he had bisexual potential or interests—we might be able to utilize the other half of the spectrum of potential arousal signals. And, if we did that often enough, he then might be gratified by femininity.”

You'll recall that Freud and the psychoanalytic tradition that followed him believed homosexuality was a regression fixation caused by an underlying, probably narcissistic, neurosis. See *Introductory Lectures* p. 376-384 and 529-531)
The often repeated statistic that 10% of any given population is gay or lesbian originates with Kinsey’s study.
The 'Society for Human Rights' was founded in 1924, but never gained national prominence.
Hooker, Evelyn. "The Adjustment of the Male Overt Homosexual." Journal of Projective Techniques 21(1957): 18-31.
The use of the word 'gay' as a replacement for 'homosexual' dates from precisely this time with precisely these people. The Mattachine society and the older organizations used 'homosexual' and 'homophile' to refer to themselves. Ironically, the use of ’Gay'  to mean ‘homosexual’ is no attributed to Frank Kameny himself, who started a “Gay is good” campaign in 1968, to parallel the “Black is beautiful” campaign.</Comments>

            <Title>The Logic of evidence</Title>
            <Text>

##### The Logic of evidence

###### The hypothetico-deductive method
Some have characterized the testing of hypotheses in science as a two-step process. The first step of the argument involves the deduction of a prediction from the hypothesis to be tested. Then, after we see whether the prediction turns out to be true, we can draw conclusions about the truth of the hypothesis. If the prediction turns out to be true, the hypothesis has been confirmed. The argument might run roughly as follows:
&lt;!--\begin{apatextbox}{Affirming the consequent}
If Hypothesis, then Prediction.\\ The Prediction is true. \\ \hline Therefore the hypothesis is true.
\end{apatextbox}--&gt;
If the prediction turns out to be false, the hypothesis has been falsified. The argument might be put roughly as follows:
&lt;!--\begin{apatextbox}{Modus Tollens / Denying the consequent}
If Hypothesis, then Prediction.\\ The Prediction is not true.\\ \hline Therefore, the Hypothesis is not true.
\end{apatextbox}--&gt;
Anyone who has taken Logic or Critical Thinking will notice an important difference between these two arguments. 

The first argument is invalid and the second is valid. 

 In the first case, it is possible for the both of the premises to be true and for the conclusion to nonetheless be false. For example, I could argue 'If you are not over 21, you cannot drink beer. I am not drinking beer, therefore, I am not over 21.' Both premises are true, but the conclusion is false. I am both over 21 and drinking coffee. The argument, therefore, does not *guarantee* the truth of the conclusion, and therefore is not valid.

Let us take an example from the history of science: the positions of the planets can very easily be predicted with Ptolemy's 2nd Century geocentric model of the solar system, with Kepler's heliocentric geometrical model, or with Newton's gravitational theory. We now know that none of these are technically true descriptions of planetary motion (they all have well-known exceptions or make positively false claims); still each makes a number of true predictions. Each of them can make produce premises like 'If my theory is true, then Venus will rise in the morning and in the evening', and 'Venus rises in the morning and in the evening', but the joining these true premises into an argument can not ensure that the theory is true. In fact, none of them are.

The first argument is a fallacy known as the "affirming the consequent". The second premise (the prediction) is the second term, or consequent, of the first premise (If hypothesis, then prediction). The argument states the first premise (If hypothesis then prediction) and then affirms its consequent (prediction), in order to conclude that the hypothesis is correct. 

Although arguments of this sort superficially resemble truth-preserving arguments like the second argument above, we have seen that it fails to ensure a true the conclusion when the premises are true. We will call these arguments - arguments that superficially resemble deductive arguments but are not truth-preserving - fallacies.

Not so for the second argument. If the hypothesis deductively entails an prediction and that prediction turns out to be false, then something **must** be wrong with the hypothesis. 

&lt;!--\newthought{The arguments above embody}--&gt; what is known as the "hypothetico-deductive" model of scientific reasoning. The hypothesis entails, deductively, a prediction and the prediction is then checked against the world. If the prediction turns out to be true, the hypothesis is confirmed (though not with certainty). If it turns out to be false, the hypothesis is falsified with certainty. 

&lt;!--\newthought{This fact of logic}--&gt;, that if the conclusion of a valid argument is false, at least one of its premises *must* be, lead Philosopher Karl Popper to propose a definition of scientific methodology we call “falsificationism.” According to Popper, as the hypothetical-deductive’ model of science can never *prove* anything, it is science’s responsibility to propose bold predictions that can be *falsified*. Scientists seek to disprove theories, not to prove them.  And a theory is well-supported when it cannot be---or has not been yet---falsified. Popper’s view is still widely held by scientists. &lt;!--\begin{marginfigure}

}
\label{fig: karlpopper}
\end{marginfigure}--&gt; 

&lt;!--\newthought{There is one more complexity}--&gt; to the simple hypothetico-deductive method that ought to be mentioned explicitly. Typically, the hypothesis and observed data require additional auxiliary hypotheses to entail the prediction. Suppose that we wanted to test the hypothesis about conservation of momentum. And suppose that we started balls of known momenta at known velocities and then measured their velocities after the collision. In order to know what to predict, we would have to trust our methods for moving the balls at the said velocity, and we would have to trust our techniques for measuring their velocities after the collisions. Our prediction might fail because our instruments aren’t working rather than because the hypothesis is wrong. So we need to add explicitly some assumptions about the techniques used to measure a phenomenon.&lt;!--\begin{thesis}[Auxiliary Hypothesis]\label{thesis:auxiliaryhypothesis}
An \emph{auxiliary hypothesis} is a hypothesis about the methods, techniques, materials, or instruments used in an experiment that ensures the formulation of a prediction from a hypothesis.\end{thesis}--&gt;


These assumptions — for example, that our techniques for measuring velocity are accurate — comprise the *auxiliary hypotheses* that inform our prediction. There are always a number of auxiliary hypotheses informing every prediction. In some ways, a given prediction is just one part of a web of hypotheses that come into play in a given theory.

            <Comments>A ‘premise’ is a part of an argument that is asserted as reasoning for drawing the conclusion.  In these two cases, there are two premises and one conclusion, which is separated by a single line.  A *valid* argument is one where it is impossible for the premises to be true and the conclusion false. In other words, a valid argument is one where if you agree with the premises, you *must* agree with the conclusions. 
‘Fallacy’ is a word philosophers use for commonly-used arguments that do not guarantee truth. There is a long history of cataloging fallacies, and many lists can be found online. Knowing the name of a fallacy is less important than understanding *why* they are fallacious: one could agree with all the premises, yet still disagree with the conclusion.</Comments>

            <Title>Committee Structure</Title>
            <Text>#### Committee structure

The APA is overseen by a Board of Directors, which is responsible for maintaining the organization, and approving all official public proclamations and publications of the organization.  The president, who opens the conference with his or her presidential address, also serves as chair of the Board of Directors during that conference. The secretary of the Board of Directors is responsible for maintaining the minutes for that meeting and implementing whatever policy decisions are required.

In addition to the Board of Directors, there are currently three standing committees of the APA. All standing committees report directly to the Board of Directors annually.  All standing committees have the right to request an open session at the general conference for whatever they wish. If they want to initiate a vote by membership, however, they must file a request with the Board of Directors. If the Board of Directors approves the request, the standing committee can administer a vote.

##### Board of Directors:
**Responsibilities**
* Hold open meetings each conference where topics can be discussed and voted upon.

**Powers:**

* Issue public proclamations.
* Maintain official publications, such as the DSM
* Create ad-hoc committees and task forces, as necessary.
* Oversee and receive reports from the standing committees.

**Initial Membership:**

 The membership of the Board of Directors is:

&lt;!-- \begin{longtable}[!t]{ | p{3cm} |  p{10cm} | }

The membership of the Board of Directors for the course of gameplay is contained in table &lt;!--\ref{table: boardMembership}--&gt;.

&lt;!-- \begin{longtable}[!t]{ | p{1cm} | p{2.5cm} | p{2.5cm} | p{2.5cm} | p{2.5cm} |  p{2.5cm} | }

\caption{Terms for Board of Directors members}
\label{table: boardMembership}
\end{longtable}--&gt;

The Board of Directors is one of a handful of standing committees of the APA. Standing committees are permanent institutions, whose membership is elected by the membership at large. Ad hoc (literally 'after the fact') committees or 'task forces' are created by simple majority vote of the Board of Directors and are tasked with generating a report on a specific problem or area of research. Usually, these are formed when the Board of Directors believes it has inadequate information on a specific subject. For the purposes of this game, ad hoc committees will conduct literature reviews on behalf of the Board of Directors and report to the membership. Ad hoc committees disband after the report is accepted by the Board of Directors.  

The Board of Directors has the power to create ad hoc committees or task forces as it sees fit. The membership of those committees may be specified directly by the Board of Directors at the time of creation, left to the chair of the newly created committee to decide, or even determined by popular vote of the membership. That decision is left to the Board of Directors.

Unlike the creation of ad hoc committees or task forces, the creation of new permanent standing committees require a majority vote of the APA membership, not just the Board of Directors. A full proposal for such a committee, specifying its membership structure, voting procedures, rights and responsibilities should be distributed to the membership at least 48 hours before the vote. Dissolving a standing committee requires a majority vote of the membership.

The Board of Directors represents the membership, it does not act in opposition.  It is incredibly important, then, that the Board seeks approval from the membership as a whole at every turn.  The Board is a capable of assigning duties to various subcommittees on its own, but all matters of policy should be turned over to the membership for an up or down vote.

&lt;!--\newpage--&gt;

##### Research Committee

The research committee is charged with distributing grants to fund research as well as enforcing the APA's Ethical Standards in the practice of Psychology and Psychiatry (see &lt;!--\ref{app: APAEthics}--&gt;).

**Responsibilites**

* Solicit proposals in the form of a 'call for research grants'


**Powers** 

* Award grants to those proposals it deems excellent
* Hearing and deciding on cases of research ethics, including punishments for violators up to and including removal from the APA for life.

The Research committee should solicit proposals in the form of a 'Call for Research Grants' that specifies both the deadline for submissions, as well as the time frame for reviewing submissions. The Research Committee should revise the enclosed 'Call for Research Grants' on p. &lt;!--\pageref{callforresearchgrants}--&gt; to suit their needs.

In the context of the game, winning a grant entitles the bearer to access the student body for a period of one class session, during which time he or she can perform his or her approved research project. After that period, the grantee will be expected to present his or her findings to the membership as a conference paper / report.

The Research committee should take great care in considering the scientific value of each proposal. The APA does not want to be seen supporting poor or biased research! As such, members of the Research committee are strongly advised to carefully consult the ‘&lt;!--\ref{basicscientificresearch}--&gt;’ on p. &lt;!--\pageref{basicscientificresearch}--&gt;. as well as the '&lt;!--\ref{ethicsofhumanresearch}--&gt;., on p. &lt;!--\pageref{ethicsofhumanresearch}--&gt;. of the gamebook.

The Research committee is also charged with hearing and ultimately ruling on charges of ethical transgression. It alone has the power to censure a member of the APA. And because these powers apply equally to all members, including those sitting on the Board of Directors, this power can be exercised without approval by the Board of Directors.

 The Board of Directors should hold an election each year for a new member of the Research committee.  

**Initial membership**

Members of the Research committee in 1971:

* L. Tyler (expiring 1972)
* K. Clark (expiring 1973)
* J. Marmor (expiring 1974)

&lt;!--\newpage--&gt;

##### Nomenclature Committee

The Nomenclature committee is charged with maintaining the official terminology of psychology and psychiatry.  This is embodied by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, which is the definitive source for definitions and classifications of mental disorders.  

**Responsibilites**

* Maintain the official diagnostic and statistical manual of mental illness

**Powers**

* Define what kind of behaviors qualify as ‘mental illnesses’, thereby (because of the rise of health insurance and managed care) defining what kind of behaviors psychologists and psychiatrists can get paid to treat.

It determines who can be diagnosed with what, what treatments are considered responsible and what disorders will be covered by medical insurance. If a condition does not appear in the DSM, psychiatrists cannot treat patients with that condition. Given the increasing importance of health insurance in the 1970s, it is vital to have a standardized diagnostic system to support billable treatments.

Members of the nomenclature committee serve for six years.

Members of the nomenclature committee are strongly advised to carefully consult the ‘&lt;!--\fullref{briefhistoryofthestudyofhomosexualityinamerica}--&gt;’ of the gamebook.

**Initial Membership**

Members of the nomenclature committee in 1971:

* G. Albee (expiring 1972)
* J. Spiegel (expiring 1974)
* R. Spitzer (expiring 1976)

&lt;!--\newpage--&gt;

##### Program Committee

The Program Committee is charged with scheduling the conferences. 

**Responsibilities**

* Solicit proposals from the membership
* Create the schedule for each conference

** Powers **

* Decide who gets to speak at any conference, thereby determining who has the ability to gain credibility.

The committee must remember that each conference opens with a public address from the sitting president, and each standing committee has the right to a session at each conference. Not all the standing committees will make use of that time, but each should be approached before the schedule is drawn up.

Proposals for symposia and presentations should be solicited from the general population. The committee meets in closed session (i.e. after class) to determine the conference schedule after reviewing all of the materials submitted. It is vitally important that the symposia and papers accepted represent the highest standard for academic work. They should be judged by that standard alone, not with respect to theoretical commitment or viewpoint. The conference schedule should be made available to the membership at least 48 hours before the conference begins (i.e. by Friday evening before a new conference).

The Program Committee is composed of three members, each of which serve three year terms. Hence, the Board of Directors must hold an election for a new member every year.

The schedule for the conference is set by the 'Program Committee', but there are a number of business events that must take place each year. These are outlined in &lt;!--\fullref{sample:bod}--&gt;.

**Initial membership**

Program committee in 1971:

* E. Hooker (expiring 1972)

            <Text>One way to explain why something happens is to demonstrate a cause for it. But causes typically do not operate in isolation. Encountering a virus may explain why you developed the flu, but the condition of having the flu only arises when a number of other things happen. In particular, a virus must invade a particular cell (flu viruses invade cells lining a person’s respiratory or digestive track). 

Except for the fact that some viruses break out of their generous hosts by breaking the host cell open and killing it, this all sounds harmless enough. But the consequences are what debilitate you:

* When the cells lining the respiratory track are killed, fluid can flow into your nasal passages; this is what you experience as a runny nose.

* This nasal fluid contains more viruses and as they drip down your throat they attack the cells lining it. You experience this as a sore throat.

* The virus particles that get into your bloodstream attack muscle cells, which you experience as muscle ache.

* Finally, you body is designed to resist this assault. One thing it does is produce pyrogens, chemicals that cause your body temperature to increase. The higher temperature reduces the capacity of cells to carry out their operations, including hosting the creation of new viruses.

Although it was the virus that caused the flu, a lot of other operations were going on. The virus had to rely on a complex bit of machinery to carry out its task of reproducing itself, and in the process laying you low with the flu.

In the 19th century, Franz Joseph Gall suggested phrenology, which sought to identify particular mechanisms of intelligence with particular bumps on the skull. The mechanism posited held that personality traits were localized in the brain, and the brain would be enlarged in specific areas for those traits. The enlargements could then be detected by the structure of the skull. We still accept the idea of localization, but unlike muscles, excess activity does not make the brain enlarge. Image from Wikimedia Commons}

The explanatory scenario just outlined, in which we invoke a mechanism to explain a causal effect, is extremely common in science.

* To explain the reproduction of cells, scientists describe the *mechanism* of cell reproduction.

* To explain how blood carries nutrients to tissues in the body, they describe the *mechanism* of circulation of the blood.

* To explain how people can remember events in their lives and new factual information, they describe the mechanisms of memory encoding, storage, and retrieval.

&lt;!--\begin{thesis}[Mechanism definition]
Mechanism: entities and activities organized so that a phenomenon occurs or entities and activities organized in such a way as to realize a function.
\end{thesis} --&gt;
Explaining the occurrence of a phenomenon by identifying the mechanism that produces it is perhaps the most common explanatory strategy in science. Accordingly, we need to consider in detail

* what a mechanism is

* how mechanisms are described

* how mechanisms are discovered

* how mechanisms are modeled

* how accounts of mechanism are tested.

            <Text>## Introducing The Game

This game highlights the intellectual conflicts that changed American psychiatry and psychology in the early part of the 1970s.

 It might seem a little odd, in a Reacting game, to be exploring relatively recent events. While there will be no executions, ostracisms or civil wars in this game, the intellectual stakes are no less high. What you know of Psychiatry and Psychology today---the social significance of the American Psychiatric Association’s *Diagnostic and Statistical Manual *(DSM), the use of psychopharmaceuticals for 'everyday' life (such as Ritalin, Adderall and anti-depressants), and the theoretically pluralistic basis of Psychology departments (behaviorism, cognitivism)---originate in this time period, in this conflict.  

During the course of this game, your class will be the ‘APA.’ Your class will be responsible for determining what conditions shall be labeled ‘mental illness’, and what evidence shall be required for distinguishing different conditions.  Actual game play will consist of organizing annual conferences, where the nation's psychiatrists and psychologists meet to share their research and conduct association business. In real time, a single conference takes 1 week. Each weekend of real time then, represents an entire year in game play time. According to your specific role, you may be presenting papers, participating in a symposium, serving on a committee, or even running for one.


Players will join ‘committees’ with different responsibilities, such as scheduling each conference and determining who will present papers on what subjects. The schedule for the first annual conference is already set: you can review it on p. &lt;!--\fullref{conferenceschedulefor1971}--&gt; . Pay careful attention to the schedule of submission and review detailed by the conference committee.  If your role sheet requires that you present your research at the conference, you must get your proposal to the conference committee on time. There is a detailed description of the form required for proposals provided under ‘&lt;!--\fullref{proposals}--&gt;.’ 


### Playing a Psychologist or Psychiatrist in the 1970s.

In 1974, the vast majority of psychiatrists would have been trained in the psychoanalytic tradition of Freud and Jung. In psychology, the vast majority would have been trained as behaviorists.

Each camp believed that they alone had a monopoly of the scientific study of the mind, and the other traded in pseudoscience.  During the 1970s, crystalizing around the demedicalization of homosexuality, this all began to change.  

In this game, we ask you to put aside what you know about modern psychology and psychiatry, and put yourself in the shoes of a died-in-the-wool psychoanalyst or hard-nosed behaviorist. We’ll get to what that means later in the game book, but if you just can’t wait, check out the introduction to psychoanalysis and behaviorism in section &lt;!--\ref{behaviorists}--&gt;.

#### Context: the role of Psychology and Psychiatry in American Political Life

In 1964, a magazine called Fact asked 12,000 psychiatrists if they would be willing to diagnose conservative presidential candidate Barry Goldwater. Of the more than 2000 that responded 1,189 responded that he appeared to have a 'personality disorder'--that slippery category between psychosis and neurosis.  The headline proclaimed (under the magazine's title 'fact:') that “1,189 Psychiatrists Say Goldwater Is Psychologically Unfit To Be President! You may recall that the 1964 election witnessed Johnson's famous 'Daisy' ad, which suggested that the election of Barry Goldwater would lead to nuclear annihilation.  &lt;!--\begin{marginfigure}

\end{center}

\label{fig: 1964Fact}
\end{marginfigure}
--&gt;


At this same time, you may recall that the US Supreme court decided in 1973 that abortion was covered by the constitutional dictate to a right to privacy, thereby blocking all laws that had kept abortion illegal.

In 1969, the American Psychological Association issued a public proclamation, citing lack of evidence to the contrary that:

&gt;**WHEREAS** in many state legislature, bills have recently been introduced for the purpose of repealing or drastically modifying the existing criminal codes with respect to the termination of unwanted pregnancies;

&gt; and **WHEREAS**, termination of unwanted pregnancies is clearly a mental health and child welfare issue, and a legitimate concern of APA;

&gt; **BE IT RESOLVED** that termination of pregnancy be considered a civil right of the pregnant woman, to be handled as other medical and surgical procedures in consultation with her physician, and to be considered legal if performed by a licensed physician in a licensed medical facility.

The American Psychiatric Association followed in 1967 with:

&gt;The emotional consequences of unwanted pregnancy on parents and their offspring may lead to long-standing life distress and disability, and the children of unwanted pregnancies are at high risk for abuse, neglect, mental illness, and deprivation of the quality of life. Pregnancy that results from undue coercion, rape, or incest creates even greater potential distress or disability in the child and the parents. The adolescent most vulnerable to early pregnancy is the product of adverse sociocultural conditions involving poverty, discrimination, and family disorganization, and statistics indicate that the resulting pregnancy is laden with medical complications which threaten the well-being of mother and fetus. The delivery that ensues from teenage pregnancy is prone to prematurity and major threats to the health of mother and child, and the resulting newborns have a higher percentage of birth defects, developmental difficulties, and a poorer life and health expectancy than the average for our society. Such children are often not released for adoption and thus get caught in the web of foster care and welfare systems, possibly entering lifetimes of dependency and costly social interventions. The tendency of this pattern to pass from generation to generation is very marked and thus serves to perpetuate a cycle of social and educational failure, mental and physical illness, and serious delinquency.

&gt;Because of these considerations, and in the interest of public welfare, the American Psychiatric Association

&gt;1)	opposes all constitutional amendments, legislation, and regulations curtailing family planning and abortion services to any segment of the population; 

&gt;2) reaffirms its position that abortion is a medical procedure in which physicians should respect the patient's right to freedom of choice - psychiatrists may be called on as consultants to the patient or physician in those cases in which the patient or physician requests such consultation to expand mutual appreciation of motivation and consequences; and 

&gt;3) affirms that the freedom to act to interrupt pregnancy must be considered a mental health imperative with major social and mental health implications. [#Anonymous:1967hr]

Needless to say, not only were these political events hugely controversial in the United States, the professional involvement of psychiatrists and psychologists was *itself* hugely controversial. 

The 'Goldwater affair', as it became to be known, embarrassed Psychiatry as a whole, painting the entire discipline as either politically motivated and unreliable. 

 And the declarations regarding abortion were widely seen as unmotivated by scientific evidence.

To this day, academic organizations have a reputation of bias toward liberal political parties.  Given that contemporary conservatism traces its root to Goldwater’s failed presidential bid, it is unsurprising that conservative groups may still harbor some suspicion of academia.

            <Comments>Unlike many other professional organizations of the late 19th century, the APA immediately granted membership to women: specifically the eminent experimental psychophysicist Christine Ladd-Franklin and Margaret Washburn in 1894, two years after its founding. Mary Whiton Calkins was the first woman elected the first president in 1905.⁠
At the same time, the famous psychologist Edward Titchener created a separate organization called the “Experimentalists” in 1904, from which he explicitly barred women. Christine Ladd-Franking engaged in high profile war of words with Titchener until his death in 1925. Unfortunately, many people misremember this conflict as happening in the APA, which is incorrect. Also unfortunately, Titchener's student E.G. Boring wrote the most famous history of experimental psychology, in which he attacks Christine Ladd-Franklin as 'invading' laboratories and 'the women graduate students manicure her fingers' in the laboratory.

&lt;!--\newpage--&gt;

#### Learning Objectives

In many ways, this is not a game about Psychology or Psychiatry, it is a game about the Philosophy of Science. This shouldn't really be surprising, as the history of the Psychology and Psychiatry is intimately linked to the history of the Philosophy of Science. Arguments made by Wundt, Freud, Watson, Hull Skinner and Miller all rely heavily on claims regarding what is or is not a legitimate scientific claim. This issues has not disappeared from undergraduate Psychological classroom either.  The APA's current guidelines for the Undergraduate Major in Psychology, published 2010, lists 10 learning outcomes for a major. The first is:



	&gt; Goal 1: Knowledge Base of Psychology

&gt; Demonstrate familiarity with the major concepts, theoretical perspectives, empirical findings, and historical trends in psychology

	&gt; Suggested Learning Outcomes

  1.1.	Characterize the nature of psychology as a discipline

  a)	Explain why psychology is a science.

  b)	Identify and explain the primary objectives of psychology: describing, understanding, predicting, and controlling behavior and mental processes.

  c)	Compare and contrast the assumptions and methods of psychology with those of other disciplines

  d)	Describe the contributions of psychology perspectives to interdisciplinary collaboration.


These guidelines were superseded by ‘Version 2.0’ in 2013. The same themes reappear:

&gt; Goal 1: Knowledge Base in Psychology

	1.1 Describe key concepts, principles, and overarching themes in psychology.

		1.1a Use basic psychological terminology, concepts and theories in psychology to explain behavior and mental processes.

		1.1b Explain why psychology is a science with the primary objectives of describing, understanding, predicting and controlling behavior and mental processes.

		1.1c Interpret behavior and mental processes at an appropriate level of complexity.

		1.1d Recognize the power of the context in shaping conclusions about individudal behavior.

		1.1e Identify fields other than psychology that address behavioral concerns.


The reader will no doubt note that the 2013 version is far more prescriptive than the original, instrumentalizing the ‘nature of psychology as a discipline’ into the measurable ‘use basic psychological terminology, concepts and theories.’  It’s also notable that the phrase “ and mental processes” appears in three of the sub points, rather than just one.  One might be tempted to assert that behaviorism is well and truly dead in Psychology. 

If the reader compares to the definitions offered by the various historical figures in the ‘&lt;!--\fullref{briefhistoryoftheapa}--&gt;’ in the gamebook, you will no doubt recognize the theoretical pluralism embodied in that statement.  My main for quoting this document is, however, the 2007 (a) and 2013 (1.1b).

The question if psychology is a science is a question of demarcation – the classic issue in the Philosophy of Science. But answering why psychology is a science assumes a affirmative answer to the demarcation problem, and hence, a particular view in the Philosophy of Science.  

For example, Wundt charged Hebart with non-scientific investigations into introspection, because Hebart did not adequately control the environment. Watson charged that McDougall's notion of behaviors having a 'purpose' was non-scientific, because McDougall did not follow strict verificationism in the philosophy of science. When Hull charged that Tolman's explanations were unscientific because they positing internal entities, he did so by citing Newton (1935). Miller and Chomsky rejected Skinner's arguments by citing Philosophers of Science such as Patrick Suppes, who contend that the history of science shows that scientists do posit internal entities, if they can modeled mathematically.


##### Textbooks: A brief review of introductory textbooks in psychology demonstrates that the current crop of answers here is not good-

Most Introduction to Psychology textbooks contain at least a nominal section addressing Goal 1. Many include a nod to history, noting Wundt, James, Freud and Pavlov. In this game, we introduce terminology, concepts and theories of psychology in a historical context:

\caption{Timeline of critical events}
\label{table: timeline}
\end{longtable}--&gt;

When one reviews these offerings, one is struct by the lack of variation. All cite the same historical movements---including, somewhat surprisingly, humanistic psychology. They *all* define science as a method or procedure, and all reject the notion that science is a body of knowledge to be memorized.  This cannot be random.

Moreover, the idea that science can be distinguished from non-science or pseudoscience based on method alone is highly questionable. Ptolemic astronomy based its work on careful observation, and applied the rigorous methods of mathematics in order to describe and predict the movements of the heavens.  So does astrology.  On the other side of the dialectic, there is little in relativistic physics or quantum mechanics that is observable or was subject to experiment *before* it was accepted as scientific.  

So neither way is the view articulated by these textbooks correct---there are non-scientific endeavors that fit the methodology-based demarcation, and there are scientific endeavors that do not. Simply speaking, one cannot demarcate science from non-science using methodology alone. 

We are in dire need of a richer, more complete approach to introducing the scientific history of Psychology.

            <Text>#### Observational research

We acquire knowledge of the world primarily through our senses. As humans, we rely most heavily, but clearly not exclusively, on vision. Seeing the world seems very straight-forward. We open our eyes and the world impresses itself upon our consciousness. 
&lt;!--\begin{marginfigure}
 \begin{center}


     \includegraphics[scale=0.50]{../images/AmbigCheeta.jpg}
\end{center}
 \caption{Ambiguous Cheetahs, from --&gt; [#Pitts:2007km]&lt;!--}
\label{fig: ambiguouscheetahs}
\end{marginfigure}--&gt;

Take a look at the image to the right.  Which head goes with which cheetah?  Can you flip your interpretation to see it the ‘other way’?  There are *tons* of created images like this, from the Necker cube to Salvador Dali paintings, the way you see the image can change dramatically, depending on the environmental conditions or what you had experienced just before seeing the image.

Our ability to see is, in part, learned. One aspect of 'successful' seeing is the ability to recognize things when one encounters them again. Recognition requires the ability to categorize. Seeing, in this robust sense, also implies the ability to organize the categories into a taxonomy or classification system.

Although much scientific research goes beyond mere observation to posit causal processes and mechanisms behind what is observed, observational research plays a vital role in the development of scientific knowledge— both in delineating the phenomenon of study and in validating hypothesis and predictions. When conducting observational research, the question of how we organize observations into categories, as well as how we organize categories into taxonomies, plays a central role. In addition, we must pay careful attention to the notion of a 'variable', and how we measure and estimate the values of variables.

Observational research is an important part of the scientific toolkit. Here we’ll present two paradigmatic observational studies that were hugely influential in the 1970s.

##### Margaret Mead

Margaret Mead was an extraordinarily talented student at Barnard college, completing here Bachelors in 1924.  She earned her Masters’ under the supervision of the famous Anthropologist Franz Boas a year later in 1925. In 1926, at the age of 23, she set off for nine months on the Manu’an Islands of American Samoa. 

She was inspired in the trip by Boas, and his concern that problems in the mental life of adolescents, was the result of western culture---specifically our prohibitions on sex---not any individual dysfunction. 

But how can one test such a hypothesis?  One cannot, because of basic human ethics, separate a bunch of children at birth to raise them outside of western culture. Nor would it be helpful to find groups of children in western culture and follow them, because there are two many variables at play to isolate the influence of sexual repression on mental health. As she argues:

&gt; The only method is that of the anthropologist, to go to a different civilization and make a study of human beings under different cultural conditions in some other part of the world.  For such studies the anthropologist chooses quite simple peoples, primitive peoples, whose society has never attained the complexity of our own. 

This last point is important: the anthropologist has to become ‘embedded’ int the culture to understand it enough to communicate with its people on their terms.  Western societies, even those sometimes found on the outskirts, are simply too complex to allow a quick study. Their language alone would take years to master, and their social structures too complex to understand quickly. As “she could hope for great intimacy in working with girls rather than with boys”, [p. 9][#Mead:1928uk] she choose to study adolescent girls in Samoa.

As her professor Boas writes in the preface to *Coming of Age in Samoa*, 

&gt; In our own civilization, the individual is beset with difficulties which we are likely to ascribe to fundamental human traits. When we speak about the difficulties of childhood and of adolescence, we are thinking of them as unavoidable periods of adjustment through which everyone has to pass. The whole psycho-analytic approach is largely based on this supposition. 
&gt; The anthropologist doubts the correctness of these views, but up to this time hardly any one has taken pains to identify himself sufficiently with a primitive population to obtain an insight into these problems. We fell, therefore, grateful to Miss Mead for having undertaken to identify herself so completely with Samoan youth that she gives us a lucid and clear picture of the joys and difficulties encountered by the young individual in a culture so entirely different from our own. [#Mead:1928uk]

Mead describes society which has very different sexual mores: 

&gt; “Masturbation is an all but universal hair, beginning at the age of six or seven. There were only three little girls in my group ho did not masturbate... Boys masturbate in groups but among little girls it is a more individualistic, secretive practice.” [p. 136][#Mead:1928uk] 

The girls, she writes “deter marriage through as many years of casual love-making as possible” [p. 195][#Mead:1928uk]

And as a result, there are few conflicts or troubles in the mental life of adolescent girls.  Thus, adolescence is not a difficult time period for *all* girls. As it is a major problem in the west, it must then follow that the ‘storm and stress’ of girls’ adolescence is due to the culture they inhabit, not their biology or process of maturation.

##### Roger Brown

Roger Brown and his research team at Harvard University in the 1960s visited the homes of “Adam,” “Eve,” and “Sarah” every two weeks during the period they were first acquiring English. The team audiotaped and transcribed everything the children and their mothers said, resulting in three corpora of such high quality that they are still in use. (Although teenagers talk somewhat differently today than in the 1960s, 2-year-olds then and now talk about juice, dogs, hats, more, allgone, etc.) 

Especially in the earliest stages, children omit a lot and parents sometimes fill in what is missing. Here is one of Brown’s examples:

&lt;!--\begin{apatextbox}{Brown’s first example}
Child- Throw Daddy \\
Mother- Throw it to Daddy
\end{apatextbox}--&gt;
The grammars that Brown’s group wrote to account for such simplified language were far more complex than you might imagine. Even more intriguing, though, were child utterances that had to be changed, not just expanded, to get an adult utterance. For example:

&lt;!--\begin{apatextbox}{Brown’s second example}
Child- What John will read? \\
Mother- What will John read? 
\end{apatextbox}--&gt;[#Brown:1968df]

Notice that there is *no* attempt by the researchers to intervene in these situations. Parents are not coached to speak to their children in a certain way, nor were they asked to fill in the sentences or avoid making corrections. There is no ‘control’ group, no independent variables, no dependent variables.  Brown and his colleagues are simply observing speech of children as it occurs.

 An understanding of how children acquire language begins with extensive observation and careful records, focused especially on ages 1-3 years. The key product is a child language corpus, which is a written transcription of all utterances by a particular child and, usually, at least one adult who is present and interacting with the child during one or more periods of observation. As technology has progressed, researchers have gained choices. In the earliest studies (and still occasionally by choice today) observations were recorded in handwritten diaries (motion picture film and soundtracks existed but were not practical in this context). By the 1960s, audio recordings were made at the time of observation — sometimes supplemented by handwritten notes — and then transcribed into written form. 

So what are we observing here?  At first pass, it may appear that the child just mixed up the word order a bit, and was corrected by a parent. Brown’s group proposed a much deeper analysis in terms of what would become know as a “generative grammar.” 
&lt;!--\newthought{The earliest versions of generative grammar}--&gt; emphasized the idea (adapted from Chomsky’s mentor, Zellig Harris) that a sentence should be viewed as the product of a series of transformations. Consider the following sentences:

&lt;!--\begin{apatextbox}{Generative Grammar}
\rowgroup{John will read what? BASE QUESTION (atypical word order for a question)} \\ \rowgroup{What John will read? PREPOSING TRANSFORMATION: moves wh-word (what) to the front.} \\ \rowgroup{What will John read? TRANSPOSING TRANSFORMATION: reverses the subject (\emph{John}) and the auxiliary verb (\emph{will}).}
\end{apatextbox}--&gt;
The final form in the sequence is what an adult would typically say. The transformations and the intermediate form are not directly observed, but Chomsky claimed that they can be inferred and are part of the speaker’s linguistic competence.

&lt;!--\newthought{Brown and his colleagues suggested}--&gt; that the child was in the process of acquiring transformations, and at this point (about 3 years of age) had acquired preposing but not transposing. As a result, the “hypothetical intermediate” became an actual, observed form. Not only did this give a neat explanation of what the child said, but in the other direction it lent support to Chomsky’s theory. [#Brown:1972to] [#Chomsky:1965uu]

#### Psychoanalysts

##### Richard Green, MD Professor of Psychology, UCLA*

Professor of Psychology and UCLA, Green is most well known for his groundbreaking studies of 'sissy boys' and 'tomboy' girls, conducted with John Money of Johns Hopkins University. Green's recent essay “Mythological, Historical and Cross-Cultural Aspects of Transsexualism”, which is reprinted in the book he co-edited with his mentor John Money Transsexualism and Sex Reassignment (1969), traces the “longstanding and widespread pervasiveness of the transsexual phenomenon.”

##### Judd Marmor, MD Psychiatrist, Hollywood, CA (Freudian)

The 'Psychiatrist to the stars', Judd Marmor has built an impressive psychiatric practice in L.A., after having immigrated to the US from Britain after serving in the British Navy during WWII. Rumor has it that many of the popular portrayals of psychoanalysis in the movies today are based on you.

Initial Member of the Research committee, term expiring 1974.

##### Charles W. Socarides, MD Professor of Psychiatry, Columbia University and/or Irving Bieber, MD Professor of Psychiatry, NYU Medical College (Freudian)

Irving Bieber is Professor of Psychiatry at New York University Medical College and Charles Socarides at Columbia University.  Socarides and Bieber have spent most of their career treating and studying male homosexuality. Bieber is primary author of the 1962 study Homosexuality: A Psychoanalytic Study of Male Homosexuals is, in many ways, a response to the Kinsey Report. It reports on you study of 106 male homosexuals and 100 male heterosexuals seeking psychoanalysis for various problems.  According to Socarides and Bieber,  homosexuality is a neurotic adaptation to unresolved conflict, usually originating in the Oedipal stage of development.


*Notable work*

##### John P. Spiegel, MD  Director, Lemberg Center for the Study of Violence, Brandeis University

World-famous for his study of combat fatigue, co-authored with Dr. Roy Grinker in the 1945 book Men Under Stress.  Grinker and Spiegel argued, quite persuasively, that combat fatigue was not a result of a character flaw, but rather the social circumstances of war. It should, therefore, be treated, not punished. Spiegel is a former president of the American Academy of Psychoanalysis.

Initial member of the nomenclature committee, term expiring 1974.

#### Behaviorists

##### Albert Bandura, PhD  Professor of Psychology, Stanford
Initially serving the APA as Vice president (or President-elect) of the APA in 1971, will become president in 1972. He is therefore an initial member of the board of directors.

Bandura was trained in Behaviorism while at the University of Iowa, where Hull's advocate Spense taught. He was not, however, attracted to the strict mathematical-deductive model proposed by Hull, tending towards the work of Tolman.  After graduating Iowa, he went west to work with other like-minded Tolman followers. Currently, Bandura is a Professor of Psychology at Stanford University. His work on 'social learning,' which was started by his 'bobo-doll' studies, is widely known. Many expect his presidential address in 1972 to both explain his notion of 'vicarious reinforcement,' and articulate the relationship between his behavioristic approach and Miller's new 'cognitive psychology'.

Bandura was elected as a Fellow of the APA in 1964.


*Notable work*

 Bandura, A. (1965). Vicarious processes: A case of no-trial learning. In L. Berkowitz (Ed.), Advances in experimental social psychology (Vol. 2, pp. 1-55). New York: Academic Press.

##### Harry Harlow, PhD Professor of Psychology, University of Wisconsin

Initially 'former' president, serving on the board of directors.

Harlow is most well known for his series of experiments on separation anxiety in baby rhesus monkeys, Harry Harlow has become one of the most important advocates for behaviorism in the APA today.  Harlow's primate lab at the University of Wisconsin is widely recognized as one of the top places for training young researchers in experimental psychology.  Harlow won the Society for Experimental Psychology's Howard Crosby Warren medal in 1956 and the National Medal of Science in 1967.  He served as President of the APA in 1970.  


*Notable work*

##### Evelyn Hooker, PhD  Emeritus Professor of Psychology, UCLA 

Evelyn Hooker studied with Karl Meunzinger and Robert Yerkes, pioneers in the fields of animal behavior. Starting in the 1950s, Hooker became interested in human sexuality. In 1953, she won a grant from the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) to study the mental health of 'non-patient, non-inmate homosexuals'.  Hooker showed that if homosexuality itself were removed from the diagnostic information, homosexual men were no more likely to be diagnosed as 'neurotic' than heterosexual men.

On the program for the first class with Dr. H. Anonymous as a panelist on the topic 'Psychiatry: Friend or Foe to Homosexuals: A Dialogue'

Initial member of the Program committee, term expiring 1972.


*Notable work*

#### Cognitivists

##### Noam Chomsky, PhD Professor of Linguistics, MIT

In 1971, Noam Chomsky is a quickly rising star in the academy. Currently a professor of Linguistics at MIT, his work is revolutionizing the field, changing the very idea of linguistics from the descriptive study of existing languages to the understanding of how languages result from formal (logical) rules. Chomsky is also a harsh critic of Skinner's radical behaviorism. His review of Skinner's 'Verbal Behavior' is widely seen as a devastating blow to behaviorism. It is contained in the appendix.

Chomsky, N. (1966). Cartesian Linguistics New York, 1966

##### George Miller, PhD Professor of Psychology, Harvard 

President of the APA in 1971. When the game begins, Miller is serving on the board of directors and responsible for the Presidential address to open the first game session. Miller was trained in behaviorism, but, in part because of his friendship with Chomsky, has developed a new approach he calls 'Cognitive Psychology.' Miller has a side interest in the history of psychology, having worked with E.G. Boring and authored Psychology: the science of mental life.

#### Independents

##### George W. Albee, PhD Professor of Psychology, University of Vermont (Psychologist)

Clinical Psychologist.  Albee worked as the executive secretary for the APA from 1951-1953, along side Harry Harlow's wife. Many of the committee structures and procedures followed today were actually refined by Albee during his time as secretary.In the 1950s, he chaired a task force to survey the resources available to mental heath professionals. The astonishing clarity of the resulting report, along with Albee's unwavering commitment to preventative mental health practices caused a great stir in psychiatric and psychological circles.

Author of 'A declaration of independence for psychology' (1964), Albee is a major figure in the often 'acrimonious' debate regarding the suitability of the medical model for understanding mental illness. If any questions arise regarding the APA's decision-making procedures, Albee is the person to ask.  He has held every position of responsibility in the organization save the Presidency and Vice-Presidency.

Initial member of the nomenclature committee, term expiring 1972. In classes over 16, also 'member at large' for the board of directors starting in 1971.

##### Kenneth Clark, PhD Professor of Psychology, CCNY (psychologist)

Kenneth Clark, along with his wife  Mamie Phipps Clark, are the authors of a hugely famous study of the racial attitudes of young children. Ken and Mamie presented four identical plastic dolls that different only with respect to color to black children between the ages of three and seven. When asked which doll they preferred, the majority selected the white doll. When asked to color in a drawing 'the same color' as themselves, most of the black children choose yellow or white crayons. Ken Clark testified as an expert in three of the five cases that were combined into the landmark school desegregation decision Brown v. The Board of Education, and his summary was cited by Chief Justice Warren (footnote 11) as influencing the court's decision.

            <Title>Decomposing</Title>
            <Text>
When scientists use the word ‘mechanism’, they are talking about an explanation that decomposes into other entities, and explains behavior in terms of the interactions of those entities’ behaviors.  They are discovered with three basic techniques:

&lt;!--\newthought{Recording activity.}--&gt; The simplest intervention on a mechanism is to record the activity of the underlying entities.  Consider by analog a steam-engine.  If one wanted to figure out how it worked, one would have to turn it on, and record the activity of its parts: the boiler does such and such, the pistons move... etc.

&lt;!--\newthought{Stimulating components.}--&gt;  If components of a mechanism are distinct, they should be able to be stimulated directly.  The Penfield Homunculus for example, was created by direct stimulation of a patient’s brain, and recording which parts of his body reacted.&lt;!--\begin{marginfigure}

     \includegraphics{../Images/Motor_homunculus.png}

\end{center}
 \caption{Penfield Homunculus, from wikiimages}
\label{fig: MattachinePamphlet}
\end{marginfigure}
--&gt;

&lt;!--\newthought{Inhibiting components.}--&gt; Some times called ‘lesioning’, this strategy is simply to block the activity of a component of a mechanism, and see record the activity of the whole, or the activity of the other components in the absence of the component of interest.  We know, for example, that the hippocampus plays a significant role in personal memory because we have a observed a patient (HM), who has his hippocampus removed surgically. [#Scoville:1957wx]

A posited mechanism must allow for at least these three methods of investigation to be considered scientific. Mechanistic explanations that do not allow for recording of the activity, stimulating, or inhibiting of components can’t be considered a scientific explanation. </Text>

            <Text>### Prologue

Your cab pulls up in front of the Shoreham hotel  in Rock Creek Park, a particularly tranquil part of the chaos that is Washington D.C. You nervously check the entrance to the hotel. It's clear. This year, there are no throngs of protesters bent on face-to-face confrontation.

They must be down at the mall participating in the massive protest calling for an end to the Vietnam war.  The radio reported an estimated crowd of at least 50,000. And that's before the 10,000 National Guardsmen were called into try to open the flow of traffic.

The story was not the same last year, in San Francisco.   

When you arrived at the hotel last year, the entrance was completely blocked by an angry crowd of gay rights activists. Individuals in the crowd were personally confronting—non-violently but aggressively—any member of the APA who appeared. The activists called this 'Zapping.' You found it terrifying.

Last year’s conference was almost shut down by the protesters. There are rumors that the FBI was in attendance last year, and it is almost certain they are here now. The Washington Post covered the event thusly:

&gt;The Washington Post May 14th 1970 -- The gay liberation and their women allies out-shrieked the head shrinkers today and took over an American Psychiatric Association session on sex. Before the morning was over the 500 psychiatrists who gathered to hear scientific studies on sexual problems demonstrated that they were just as prone to anti-social behaviour as anyone else. 'This lack of discipline is disgusting', said Dr Leo Alexander, a psychiatrist at the meeting. Then he diagnosed the problem of one of the lesbian protesters: 'She's a paranoid fool,' the doctor said, 'and a stupid bitch.'

The conference was a circus.  Young men dressed in flamboyant gowns stormed through the hallways. Sessions were disrupted by guerrilla theater. In one, an activist named Frank Kameny grabbed the microphone and shouted “Psychiatry is the enemy incarnate. Psychiatry has waged a relentless war of extermination against us. You may take this as a declaration of war against you.”

It all culminated in a session featuring Irving Bieber, author of the 1962 study on homosexuality published in his book *Homosexuality*.

According to eye witnesses, a protester interrupted Bieber almost before he started with the claim that “I've read your book Dr. Bieber, and if that book talked about black people the way it talks about homosexuals, you'd be drawn and quartered, and you'd deserve it!” [p. 200-201][#Clendinen:2013wy] 

Bieber tried to respond by claiming “I never said homosexuals were sick—what I said was that they had displaced sexual adjustment.”  

“That's the same thing, motherfucker!” yelled another.

Earlier this year, a meeting of the New York branch of the APA, a handful of gay activists interrupted a talk by noted Psychiatrist from Columbia University Charles Socarides.

There have long been rumors of a shadow organization of homosexual psychiatrists called the 'Gay-PA.’ It appears these rumors are no longer in doubt. The highlight of this year's program promises to be a symposium titled “Psychiatry: Friend or Foe to Homosexuals: A Dialogue.” The panel includes Dr. Evelyn Hooker, one of the participants in last year's show down and the mysterious 'Dr. H. Anonymous,' who claims to be both a licensed psychiatrist and homosexual.

Everyone knows that a mentally ill person cannot practice psychiatry. And homosexuality is a mental illness. This Dr. H. Anonymous, if he or she is telling the truth, is risking his or her medical license. But yet there must be more. We all know, ever since Kinsey's famous study, that about 10% of the population identifies as primarily homosexual, while a significantly larger percentage have engaged in homosexual activity.  And ever since Hooker's paper in 1956, we know that most of this population are psychologically normal. Given the numbers attending this meeting, Dr. H. Anonymous surely can't be alone.

On the other hand, Socarides and Bieber have called Hooker and Kinsey's data into question. If they are correct, and only a small percentage of the population is homosexual, on what basis could one call it a 'normal' behavior?  Are homosexuals, as Bieber contends, individuals whose “heterosexual function is crippled, like the legs of a polio victim”?

--&gt;

Back in October of 1969, Time magazine had a cover story on the movement amongst homosexuals---who they called 'inverts'---for greater social recognition. In the second paragraph, it referred to “gay” bars (with the quotations), but then proceeded to use the word “gay” without quotes. It even used the term 'gay marriage.' The article, however, made the following claim:

&gt;Most experts agree that a child will not become a homosexual unless he undergoes many emotionally disturbing experiences during the course of several years. A boy who likes dolls or engages in occasional homosexual experiments is not necessarily "queer": such activities are often a normal part of growing up. On the other hand, a child who becomes preoccupied with such interests or is constantly ill at ease with the opposite sex obviously needs some form of psychiatric counseling. While only about one-third of confirmed adult inverts can be helped to change, therapists agree that a much larger number of "prehomosexual" children can be treated successfully

Who are these 'experts' anyway? Is Psychiatry headed to another embarrassment like the Goldwater affair?

These thoughts raise a larger specter in your mind: are psychiatry and psychology *scientific*?

Starting a decade ago, Thomas Szasz, Professor of Psychiatry at State University of New York Health Science Center in Syracuse, New York has been arguing, quite publicly, that 'mental illness' is a myth!  His ideas challenge the very foundation of your field.  He's listed on the program, and you're quite excited to get a chance to discuss his polemic claims in some detail.

At the same time, George Miller, who is serving as the President of the APA this year, is something of a revolutionary himself. Miller has been arguing for the existence of something called 'Cognitive Psychology', which directly challenges the 50-year tradition of limiting psychological research to the observation, prediction and control of human behavior. For half a century, psychologists have been convinced that they cannot scientifically investigate unobservable entities like ‘beliefs’, ‘desires’, ‘personalities’ and ‘minds’, but rather must study only the behavior of an organism in its environment. Now even that is being challenged!

Are psychology and psychiatry scientific?  Is there such a thing as a 'mental illness'?  Can (or should) science be used to make the world  a better place?  </Text>

            <Title>Learning Objectives</Title>
            <Text>##### Learning Objectives of the Game

At the completion of this game, the students will be able to:

* Recognize that the historical contingency of the nature of our contemporary disciplines 

* Identify and respond to historical examples at which debates about evidence shift into debates about the philosophy of science, and the legitimacy of evidence. (See examples in XX)

* Demonstrate, using actual examples from historical psychology, a more sophisticated understanding of the process of scientific inquiry than the simplistic experimental model. 

     * Understand the concept of a ‘paradigm’ as Kuhn originally meant it: as a ‘model’ experiment that defines an era of a discipline or a scientific culture.

     * Distinguish between observational studies, experimental interventions and modeling, and the scientific value of each.

### Brief History of “mental illness”

What makes a certain condition a ‘mental’ condition or a 'medical' or ’neurological’ condition?  Suppose you are a family doctor, and a patient presents with an unwelcome and unwanted problem---a twitch, perhaps. Do you call a psychiatrist or a neurologist? How do you know?

While behaviors associated with mental illness---hallucinations, catatonic states, mania, etc.---have been known since ancient times, psychiatry dates its regularization as a scientific discipline to the work of the French physician Phillipe Pinel. His *Traité médico-philosophique sur l'aliénation mentale; ou la manie* stands as the first attempt at a scientific classification of mental illness. The book, translated as *Treatise on Insanity* in 1806 by D.D. Davis, is excerpted in Appendix &lt;!--\ref{app: Pinel}--&gt; on page &lt;!--\pageref{app: Pinel}--&gt;.  

Pinel was an intellectual disciple of Étienne Bonnot de Condillac, who in turn, was a disciple of John Locke. Locke is most well known as the intellectual progenitor of the American Constitution, but his views on the nature of mind and the empirical basis of knowledge held sway over much of the Western intellectual world in the first half of the 19th century.  Locke's influence on Condillac and hence Pinel was two-fold: first, he held that all our ideas originate in sensation and reflection. Second, and as importantly, Locke followed Francis Bacon in teaching that all knowledge must be based on careful, systematic observation.

For the empiricists, it follows that insanity, which is a severe form of our ideas 'leading us astray', is explained by a incorrect connection and association of ideas. The mechanism is simple: some of our ideas have a natural affinity or connection with one another. Others are held together by mere custom or habit. Cases of insanity are cases where habitual associations become so disorganized they begin to effect the 'natural' associations. This misassociation can become so extreme that it can “set us awry in our actions, as well moral as natural, passions, reasonings, and notions themselves” [Bk 2, Ch 33, p9. Pg. 531][#Locke:1959wj]. To this day, we use metaphors like 'lost his senses' to describe someone with mental illness; and we describe poorly chosen actions as 'not very sensible.'

This is simply the theoretical basis for understanding insanity in the broadest possible terms.  To truly understand how mental disorder is defined and classified, we must consider how the mentally ill have been treated.

#### Foundations
##### Foundation in Empiricism: Phillipe Pinel

Phillipe Pinel (1745-1826) revolutionized the treatment of the insane. When, in 1792, he was appointed a physician at the main asylum in Paris---the Bicêtre hospital---the situation was dire. According to a biographer in 1846:

&gt; The buildings were unfit for habitation. In them were congregated men crouching together in the mud, in stone cells, narrow, cold, damp, destitute of air and light, and merely furnished with a straw bed, seldom renewed, and soon becoming foul and offensive; wretched dens, in which one would hesitate to place the meanest animal. The insane, who were immured in these filthy holes, were at the mercy of their attendants, and these persons were malefactors released from prison. The wretched patients were loaded with chains and manacled like convicts. Thus given up defenseless to the wickedness of their guardians, they were the sports of an insulting mockery, or of a brutality all the more blind that it was gratuitous. [p. 194-195][#Marx:1847vc]

Upon his arrival, Pinel immediately began advocating pity, respect, and compassion for the patients, not only for humanitarian reasons, but also in order to allow the Baconian method of careful observation. Given the terrible conditions at the Bicêtre, Pines argued, one would never be able to determine if the behavior of the patients was the result of some underlying condition, or the condition of the Hospital itself. Bicêtre's chief physician, Pussin, was sympathetic to Pinel's techniques, and began a pilot study of unchaining the patients.


Two years later, Pinel was appointed  chief physician of the Hospice de la Salpêtrière---Paris' parallel institution for women. There, the women were kept chained, often naked, in subterranean cells; subjected to the terrors of abusive guards and hungry rats. Pinel immediate banned the use of metal chains as restraints, allowed the women clothing, and established something resembling human civility. This act was mythologized during the French Revolution as part of the overthrow of the aristocratic order, and has been duly commemorated in Art.

Pinel's revolutionary kindness is not just a story of a sympathetic humanitarian.  Pinel's goal was to systematical classify mental illness in the Baconian manner.  The conditions of confinement found in the Bicêtre and the Salpêtrière compounded the patients' mental illness, and confounded his attempts at observation. In these conditions, one could not determine if the regularity of symptoms found in the population resulted from the illness or the ‘treatment.’ By providing the patients respect and dignity, he believed he could observe their mental illness in a more untainted form.

In general, Pinel followed Locke and Condillac in holding that insanity was 'derangement of the understanding’, yet extended the view to cover cases where memory, understanding and judgment were perfectly sound, and still the patient was maniacal. 

Pinel thus abandoned any formal all-encompassing theoretical explanation of insanity per se, especially that which originated in Ancient Greek thought. The Greeks, he reasoned, were wrong about how the human brain functions, as we now understood. And as their system was based on their mistaken physiology, it is unreliable. 

Instead, Pinel explicitly bases his system on “the numerous and important facts which have been discovered and detailed by modern pneumatologists” [p. 135][#Pinel:1806ws]

\label{table: pinel}
\end{longtable}
--&gt;

Pinel spent a great amount of time showing that the conditions he was treating did not have a physiological basis. Much of his argumentation in Treatise on Insanity turns on the dissections performed on patients who had died while at the Bicêtre. The reason for this was two-fold: first, the ancient Aristotlean understanding of the mind held that mental illness resulted from too much or too little of one of the four main 'humours': black bile, yellow bile, blood and phlegm.  By showing that the mentally ill had no significant lesions in the brain, or imbalances in their 'fluids', Pinel was able to establish the independence of psychiatry from other forms of medicine.

Secondly, there is a long tradition of defining the 'mental' as that which is opposed to the 'physical'. For example, Rene Descartes famously argues that the actions of our bodies can be explained entirely in physical, mechanistic terms, except that which can be attributed to, in his terms, our 'souls.'  It follows then, that if an illness is to be truly mental, it must not have a physical explanation. And most importantly, physical causes are treated with physical interventions. As insanity was now deemed non-physical, the treatment cannot be physical. Hence, psychiatry is a discipline independent from physical medicine.

While Pinel had no strong theoretical commitment or agenda, by following Locke's notion of mental illness as a confusion of ideas, he made two significant contributions to both psychiatry as a medical discipline and our understanding of the mind more broadly: First, if insanity was just a misassociation of ideas, it was not a permanent, inherited incurable disease. Second, if insanity is a misassociation of ideas, it does not depend on or result from physiological changes. Explanations for mental illness thus did not require autopsy; and treatment did not require surgery. Psychiatry was, as a result, independent of medicine.

It is likewise important to recognize that Pinel was, in many ways, precisely following Bacon's system of investigation. He was not attempting to form an overarching explanation. He was setting down tables upon tables of observed facts, classifying and arranging phenomena, highlighting privileged instances, and was open to any and all techniques that might shed light on these cases. After initial observation, he split “insanity” into four varieties, distinguishing between the incurable dementia and idiocy from the often transient and curable mania and melancholy.

Therapeutically, Pinel called his humane treatment of the insane the 'moral treatment.' In his words,

&gt;I then discovered, that insanity was curable in many instances, by mildness of treatment and attention to the state of the mind exclusively, and when coercion was indispensable, that it might be very effectually applied without corporal indignity. (p. 108).

His therapeutic program meant paying attention to the environment in which the insane were confined. He changed the architecture, the diet, the way the nurses and orderlies treated the patients, everything.  He even went so far as to allow the higher-functioning patients to work as nurses for the lower-functioning. Patients were listened to. Careful, detailed personal histories were taken. Baths, walking and gardening were encouraged.

A lack of theoretical commitment meant that Pinel could borrow techniques from the many snake-oil salesmen and charlatans who populated Western Europe at the time. One of these fads happened to be mesmerism, now known as hypnosis. We’ll come back to the importance of mesmerism in the rise of psychoanalysis below.

As a follower of Bacon, Pinel was only interested tabulating observations of results, and comparing them against the observations of the condition without intervention.  He insisted that we cannot cure a disease until we know of the progression of the disease *without* intervention.  In his own words, “We cannot cure diseases by the resources of art, if not previously acquainted with their terminations, when left to the unassisted efforts of nature.” (p. 109). For him, extreme treatments could only be used in extreme cases. The curable would be cured by simple humane treatment.

It is worth pointing out that the word 'asylum' means, of course, a sanctuary or refuge. It *first* appears in English in the 1808 translation of Pinel's *Treatise on Insanity*, to reference the Bicêtre. It appears in English newspapers starting in the 1860's, to describe leper colonies---long after Pinel's 'moral treatment' had come to dominate the English treatment of the mentally ill.

##### Mental Alienation - Esquirol

While Pinel tended to think of transient mental illness as a confusion of ideas, he occasionally spoke of the role of passions in mental illness.  In the early pages of the Treatise, he hypotheses three different causes of insanity:

&gt;I now proceed to describe the general progress of periodical insanity. Among its various causes; exclusive of changes in the state of the atmosphere, my experience leads me to enumerate as the most frequent; undue indulgence of the angry passions; any circumstances calculated to suggest the recollection of the original exciting cause of the disease, intemperance in drinking, inanition, &amp;c. [p. 12][#Pinel:1806ws]

Pinel's greatest student, Esquirol built on this hypothesis of 'undue indulgence of the angry passions' and redefined the notion of transient insanity as 'mental alienation.' It was Esquirol who grew the empirical understanding of the mind into a full-fledged psychiatric system. But like Pinel, the set of conditions he sought to explain were those with symptoms that were not obviously explained by physical, bodily conditions.

Esquirol split Pinel’s ‘Melancholia’ (see &lt;!--\fullref{table: pinel}--&gt;, into ‘monomania,’ or obsession with a single idea, and 'lypemania.' The latter he renamed partially because the ‘melancholia’ implied the medieval theory of 'humors' and  'black bile,’ which Pinel specifically wanted to banish. 

Monomania, lypemania and mania were distinguished by the nature of the passions that are out of order: “The passions of the insane are impetuous, especially in mania and monomania. They are of a depressing character in lypemania. In dementia and imbecility, those only exist, which spring from the first wants of man,--love, anger, jealousy.” [p 26][#Esquirol:1845ug]  

As the curable, transient forms of insanity were diseases of malformed passions, their treatment required reforming or redirecting the passions. His five varieties of insanity are defined thus:

1. Lypemania (melancholy of the ancients) delirium with respect to one, or a small number of objects, with predominance of a sorrowful and depressing passion.

2. Monomania, in which the delirium is  limited to one or a small number of objects, with excitement, and predominance of a gay, and expansive passion.

3. Mania, in which the delirium extends to all kids of objects, and is accompanied by excitement.

4. Dementia, win which the insensate utter folly, because the organs of thought have lost their energy, and the strength requisite to fulfill their functions.

5. Imbecility, or idiocy, in which the conformation of the organs has never been such, that hose who are thus afflicted, could reason justly. [p. 29][#Esquirol:1845ug]

It is important to note here that the passions *accompany* delirium with respect to collections of objects.  One cannot be passionate without being passionate about something. The 'something' that is the object of passion is supplied by the senses---and hence, we're still within a Lockean framework of understanding the mind.  

According to the Lockean framework, all ideas originate in sense experience or internal reflection. When the passions directed at one of these ideas becomes excessive and out of control, lypemania or monomania results, depending on the nature of the particular passion that becomes excessive. When the passions are exaggerated without a specific object, and hence apply themselves to every object, or what ever object is before the senses at a particular moment, we call that mania.

Mental illness's causes “are as numerous as its forms are varied.”  Case studies presented in his Mental Maladies include climate, seasons, age, sex, temperament, trauma (especially during the first menstrual cycle for young women), excessive study, ambition, etc. Again, as in Pinel, the difference between the mentally ill and the mentally stable is one of scale, not of kind.  Everyone has passions---they are why we grieve, fall in love, work for that 'A', make personal sacrifices for our friends and families, etc.---the question of insanity is whether these passions are appropriate or excessive and whether they are directed at an appropriate or inappropriate object.

According to Esquirol:

&gt;“The first wants of man, limiting themselves to those connected with his preservation and reproduction, provoke the determinations of instinct; an internal impulse leads us to gratify them.

&gt;The secondary wants, attach themselves to the first, and the desires which they excite, acquire as much more energy, as we have means of satisfying them, They produce the primitive passions; in fine, they are the wants which are connected with our preservation; and are the fruit of our increasing intelligence and civilization. They engender the factitious passions,—those passions which cause the greatest injury to man, especially in the higher walks of life.

&gt;Infancy, except from the influence of the passions, is almost a stranger to insanity; but at the epoch of puberty, the sentiments, unknown until this period, cause new wants to arise. Insanity then appears, to trouble the first moments of the moral existence of man.
At mature age, the relations become extended, social wants multiple and the passions take a new character. In proportion as the amorous passions become enfeebled, those of a factitious nature grow strong. Personal interest, ambition, love of distinction and avarice, replace the charms of love and delights of paternity.

&gt;At this period of life also, mental alienation appears; insanity is more obstinate, and more concentrated. It passes more readily into a chronic state; and is more dependent upon abdominal lesions.

&gt;A sense of his weakness, renders the old man more clam; and while meditating upon the errors to which the passions lead, he isolates himself, and becomes an egotist.

&gt;Insanity from a moral cause, rarely exists with him, and when he loses his reason, it is because his organs are fatigued and exhausted. Hence, it is neither mania nor monomania which is developed, at this period, but senile dementia.

&gt;Of all moral causes, those which most frequently produce insanity, are pride, fear, fright, ambition, reverses of fortune, and domestic trouble. This last should have been placed, relative to its great influence, at the head of the moral causes, if it be limited to a simple ideas; but by domesticate troubles, I express all the pains, all the griefs, all oppositions, misfortunes and dissensions that grow out of the family state.
[P. 45-46][#Esquirol:1845ug]

Esquirol began to gather around himself a 'circle' of students who are sometimes referred to as the 'mental alienists.’ Two of the most famous of his students were Charles Lasègue, who is now credited with working out the first definition of hysteria and first documenting *anorexia nervosa*; and Étienne-Jean Georget who delineated four sub-types of 'monomania': theomania (religious obsession), ertomania (sexual obsession), demonomania (obsession with evil) and homocidal monomania.

Esquirol's concept of monomania sparked what is probably the first recorded wave of copy-cat psychosis. In November 1825, a young single mother of two named Henriette Cornier, decapitated the 19 month-old child of her neighbors. She had prepared her room for the act, even placing a bucket to catch the blood. She had known the family of the infant for only ten days, and had, up until this event, been nothing but loving and gentle towards the little girl who would be her victim. When the police arrived, she offered no resistance to the police, and did not flee. She confessed, saying that the idea had taken hold of her, and she simply had to act upon it.

The case became a sensation across Europe. Georget diagnosed her as a 'homicidal monomaniac.' At her trial, the jury decided that the act had not been premediated and as a result, she was sentenced to life in prison with hard labor instead of death. This ruling makes little sense: Cornier admitted that the idea had occurred to her before the event, and she had carefully prepared her room for the murder. Thus, many commentators---include Lisa Appignanesi [p 75][#Appignanesi:2009vl]---have attributed the jury’s leniency to Georget's diagnosis of mental alienation. After all, if Cornier was mentally ill, does pre-planning count as 'premediation'?

The idea of the murderous monomaniac took off across Europe, informing or appearing in some of the greatest literature of era, including (according to various literary critics) Poe's “The Tell-Tale Heart,” the character of Roskolvikov in Dostovesky's *Crime and Punishment*, and even Heathcliff in Bonte's *Wutherheights*. The Marquis de Sade is also said to have been a monomaniac.

#### Early Neurology

Western medicine understood that the nervous system used, or conducted, electricity from the Galvani’s famous frog-leg experiments of 1780. There were, as one might expect, different interpretation of the relationship between nerves and electricity---Galvani believed electricity was the ‘vital force’ contained in living things. Galvani’s colleague Volta, who went on to lend his name to the ‘Volt’, argued that the frog leg reacted to electricity, but did not contain it.
The precise relationship between nerves and electricity, as well as the relationship between the nervous system an our psychology, was not nailed down for a long time. But that didn’t stop researchers in this era from speculating wildly. One of the most famous, whose theories about psychology are enshrined in our language in terms as frequent as ‘nervous’, is George Beard.

#####  American Nervousness --- George Beard

George Beard (1839-1883) was an American physician who started out advocating for the use of electricity as a medical intervention.  His first book *Medical Uses of Electricity* ([#Beard:1867tz]) suggested that electricity could be used to cure 'general nervous debility,' including dyspepsia, chorea, neuralgia, anaemia, or amenorrhoea. Beard was a charismatic popular author, who went on to write a series of popular home-healthcare books starting with *Our Home Physician: Handy Book of Family Medicine* in 1869.

\label{fig: georgebeard}
\end{marginfigure}
--&gt; 

Starting in the 1870s, Beard became increasingly interested in psychological disorders. In 1881, he published *American Nervousness*, a book that came to define psychological treatment for a generation.  'Nervousness' did not mean then what it means today: jitteriness or tension. Then, it denoted a kind of fundamental exhaustion—what we still call a 'nervous breakdown'.  Technically, Beard defined it as:

&gt;“deficiency of lack of nerve-force. This condition, together with all the symptoms of diseases that are evolved from it, has developed mainly within the nineteenth century, and is especially frequent and severe in the Northern and Eastern portions of the United States. Nervousness, in the sense here used, is to be distinguished rigidly and systematically from simple excess of emotion and from organic disease.” [p. vi][#Beard:1881tg]

It was caused by “modern civilization, which is distinguished from the ancient by these five characteristics: steam-power, the periodical press, the telegraph, the sciences, and the mental activity of women.” (p. vi)

Beard was building on both folk theory of innate energy as well as recent discoveries in neurology (compare, for example, the concurrent theory of 'specific sense energies' proposed by  Müller – see the &lt;!--\fullref{birthofpsychology:germanphysiologicalpsychologyinthe1880s-1890s.}--&gt;.). But he extended his view to cover diseases such as “neurasthenia (nervous exhaustion... hysteria, hay-fever, sick-headache, inebriety... some and phases of insanity.” (p. vii) whose 'signs' could include:

&gt;The nervous diathesis; susceptibility to stimulants and narcotics and various drugs, and consequent necessity of temperance; increase of the nervous diseases inebriety and neurasthenia (nervous exhaustion), hay-fever neuralgia, nervous dyspepsia, asthenopia and allied diseases and symptoms; early and rapid decay of teeth; premature baldness; sensitiveness to cold and heat; increase of diseases not exclusively nervous, as diabetes and certain forms of Bright's disease of the kidneys and chronic catarrhs; unprecedented beauty of American women; frequency of trance and muscle-reading; the strain of dentition, puberty and change of life; American oratory, humor speech and language; change in type of disease during the past half century, and the great intensity of animal life on this continent. (p. vii-ix)

Beard died shortly after the publication of *American Nervousness*, but his cause was taken up by Silas Wier Mitchell (1829-1914), who popularized a standard treatment for American Nervousness: the rest cure. As you can probably imagine, if the cause of American Nervousness was modern civilization, including women having a mental life, the cure was removal from modern civilization, including banning women from having a mental life.

In 1885, at the age of 25, Charlotte Perkins Gilman, a member of a prominent family of American progressives that included the abolitionist author Harriet Beecher Stowe, the suffragist Isabella Beecher Hooker, and the charismatic clergyman Henry Ward Beecher, gave birth to her only child Katharine Beecher Stetson. After the birth, Charlotte Perkins-Gilman experienced what we now recognize as a severe case of post-partum depression.

She was taken to see Silas Wier Mitchell. She described her experience of the treatment she received thus:

&gt;“During about the third year of this trouble I went, in devout faith and some faint stir of hope, to a noted specialist in nervous diseases, the best known in the country.  This wise man put me to bed and applied the rest-cure, to which all still-good physique responded so promptly that he concluded there was nothing much the matter with me, and sent me home with solemn advice to 'live as domestic a life as far as possible,' to 'have but two hours' intellectual life a day' and 'never touch a pen, brush or pencil again' as long as I lived. This was in 1887.” (“Why I wrote The Yellow Wallpaper, 1913)

Her experiences you may know from the American Standard short story The Yellow Wallpaper (1892). Gilman acknowledged that she never suffered from the hallucinations her character does, but that she “came so near the borderline of mental ruin that I could see over.” (1913)

\end{marginfigure}
--&gt; 


While Beard and Wier Mitchell are today often ridiculed as snake-oil salesmen playing on political concerns over rapid modernization and the suffragist movement, they made a number of notable contributions to our commonsense understanding of psychological disorder. First, they indelibly linked mental disorders to neurology. As mentioned above, we still use phrases like 'nervous breakdown' in common parlance to explain psychological disorder. Second, by proscribing puberty, birth, menopause and the 'unprecedented beauty of American women' as prime causes of mental illness, they further established a link between the onset and frustration of sexuality with mental illness, a point upon which Freud would build psychoanalysis.

It would be a mistake, however, to accept the simplistic narrative that the doctors of this era were manipulating and abusing their female patients without their consent. Historians of Psychology Laura C. Ball and Jennifer L. Bazar have recently demonstrated that in some cases, some women aggressive sought out procedures, such as clitorectomies, in this period. In one remarkable case, a patient even 'tormented the doctors to operate again.' [#Ball:2010tk]

One way to chart the rise of psychiatric diagnosis is to consider how people with mental illness are counted.  Starting in 1830, the US census included categories for the disabled, including 'blind' and 'deaf.' [#Gorwitz:1974tt] From 1840-1870, the census included the category 'idiocy/insanity.' Starting in 1880, however, the federal government began using categories of mental illness. In 1880, those categories were:

--&gt;

Readers of these sections will no doubt recognize this taxonomy as owing an intellectual debt to both Esquirol (Melancholy, Mania, Hysteria and Dementia) *and* Beard (Nerves).

##### Early Neurology --- Charcot

Charcot began his career at the Salpêtrière tending to the 'incurables'—the patients whose conditions had been classified as 'idiocy' or 'dementia.' Charcot saw himself primarily as a nosologist: a classifier or taxonomizer of disease, rather than a healer. His appointment was, in many ways, ideal. This was a patient population for which there was no hope of cure, and morever, had not been studied in a careful way.  

&lt;!--\begin{marginfigure}

\label{fig: charcotpatient}
\end{marginfigure}
--&gt;

Charcot is, today, often classified as a neurologist. That is a bit of historicism, as there was no such field when he began work.  In fact, the 'neuron doctrine', or the idea that the nervous system is composed of individual cells called 'neurons,' is not formally advanced until 1891. And it isn't until 1911 that Ramon y Cajal uses the Golgi stain to highlight neurons in the hippocampus, confirming the neuron doctrine.

None of that stopped Charcot from classifying a huge number conditions and diseases we still recognize today: multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS or “Lou Gerig's disease,” it was once called “Charcot's disease”), lenticulostriate artery (“Charcot's artery”), joint arthopathy (“Charcot's joint”), peroneal muscular atrophy (“Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease”), Charcot Wilbrand syndrome, Charcot's intermittent hepatic fever and even Parkinson's disease were all first named or described by Charcot.

Methodologically, Charcot advocated what he called the 'anatomo-clinical' method, which meant careful anatomical analysis performed largely post-mortum combined with case studies of vivisection in both animals and human subjects. Once a behavioral deficiency has been identified, careful anatomical studies are carried out to determine any corresponding anatomical 'deficiency,' or lesion. In his own words:

&gt;Allow me to recall to your minds the opinion which that most illustrious physiologist, Claude Bernard, thus expressed:—“Pathology,” said he, “should not he subordinated to physiology. Quite the reverse. Set up first the medical problem which arises from the observation of a malady, and afterwards seek for a physiological explanation. To act otherwise would be to risk overlooking the patient, and distorting the malady.” These are excellent words, which I have ventured to quote verbatim, because they are absolutely significant. They enable us to clearly understand that the whole domain of pathology appertains strictly to the physician, who alone can cultivate it and make it fruitful, and that it necessarily remains closed to the physiologist who, systematically confined within the precincts of his laboratory, disdains the teaching of the hospital ward. (p. 8)


In 1878, he began extensive work on hypnosis. Hypnosis had been practiced at the Salpêtrière for over 50 years--since the days of Pinel, in fact. Charcot became increasingly interested in the therapeutic use of hypnosis to cure what he called 'hysteria', a vaguely-defined collection of usually transient symptoms that included paralysis, anesthesias, visual or auditory agnosias, temporary blindness or deafness, amnesia and seizures. While 'hysteria' came to be identified closely with women, Charcot himself believed that it could effect men, and treated many men that he diagnosed with hysteria.

This does not mean, however, that Charcot gave up his commitment to neurological explanations of behavior. He simply allowed functional and/or physiological explanations in addition to the anatomical. In his words:

&gt; There is another important fact in the history of neuroses in general, and of hysteria in particular, which clearly shows that these diseases do not form, in pathology, a class apart, governed by other physiological laws than the common ones. (13)

I've quoted this passage because it is the first use of the word 'neuroses' in print.  It's root in neurological terminology is obvious, but here Charcot uses it to demarcate transient, psychological, functional or dynamic neurological conditions from the incurable, intransient, anatomical neurological conditions. The former we classify as ‘mental’, the latter ‘neurological’---even today. 'Neurosis' thus supplants 'mental alienation' and 'nervousness' as the descriptor of the set of psychological conditions that cannot be explained physically, even though it’s root is connected to the idea of a physical manifestation in ‘neurons.’

In 1890, blocked by antisemitism in Germany from further education, a young Sigmund Freud came to study with M. Charcot. There, he learned the techniques of hypnosis and studied many cases of hysteria. Later in life, Freud frequently referred to Charcot as his 'mentor,' and even attributed the idea that all neuroses originate 'in the genitals' to Charcot.

In his eulogy for Charcot, Sigmund Freud said:

&gt;He was not a reflective man, not a thinker: He had the nature of an artist—he was, as he himself said, a 'visuel', a man who sees... He used to look again and again at the things he did not understand, to deepen his impression of them day by day, till suddenly an understanding of them dawned on him.  In his mind's eye the apparent chaos presented by the continual repetition of the same symptoms then ave way to order: the new nosological picture emerged, characterized by the constant combination of certain groups of symptoms... He might be heard to say that the greatest satisfaction a man could have was to see something new-- that is, to recognize it as new; and he remarked against and again n the difficulty and value of this kind of 'seeing'. (Quoted in Mad, Bad and Sad, p. 128)

It should be fairly obvious that Freud here is dismissing, essentially, Charcot's Baconian approach to scientific classification: careful, close observation with only careful, conservative theoretical suppositions. Unlike Charcot, who is remembered only in the names of the diseases he classified, Freud became globally famous for his theoretical suppositions. Whereas Charcot was content with describing neuroses and localizing them in the nervous system, Freud sought to explain the origins of neuroses in non-physical terms.

#### Rise of Psychoanalysis

##### Hysteria and Hypnosis: Freud &amp; Breuer on Anna O.

By the end of the 19th century, we are beginning to find general agreement that mental illnesses are characterized by symptoms with no bodily, physical (or in Beard's terms 'organic') explanation. That understanding defined the limits of psychiatry. When a condition could be explained in anatomical terms, it was no longer considered psychiatric and reverted to medical or neurological. When it could not be understood physically---when it had to be explained in terms of 'psychic energy---it was given to the psychiatrists.

This thesis was not challenged largely because psychiatrists practiced in hospitals that contained psychiatric patients. That sounds circular, but it isn't: Pinel, Esquirol and Charcot were attempting to create a theory of mental illness that could explain the patients they saw before them. The patients they saw before them were not brought there because they fit the theory, or because they had chosen to be there. They were brought to the Bicêtre and Salpêtrière when the rest of the medical community had given up attempting to explain their symptoms.


The same can be said for Beard and Wier Mitchell: Perkins Gilman was taken to see Wier Mitchell only after all physical interventions had failed.

These founders of psychiatry theorized about a population that had been deemed mentally ill *because the medical community had given up explaining their symptoms*. Not the other way around. The Psychiatric hospital was a kind of catch-all for those individuals whose symptoms could not be alleviated by physical medicine, and hence it is unsurprising that the definitions of insanity we find in this era require the absence of a physical explanation.

Without a control population, there was no way these classifications could tease apart underlying conditions from any effects that may have resulted from being classified this way in the first place. 

In 1880, Josef Breuer, a student of the great psycho-physiologist Ewald Hering, was studying the ear as a part of his research at Vienna General Hospital. It was there that he first met 'Anna O.', a young woman with an extremely acute cough. Finding **no physical reason** for the cough, her family physician diagnosed her with “typical *tussis nurvosa* [nervous cough]” [p 27][#Freud:kVwxqGOZ] 

 Shortly thereafter a number of other symptoms arose. Freud &amp; Breuer describe her case thusly:

&gt;  Before this time she too had always enjoyed good health, showing no sign of nervous indisposition during her development. Of considerable intelligence, remarkably acute powers of reasoning, and a clear-sighted intuitive sense, her powerful mind could have digested, needed even, more substantial intellectual nourishment, but failed to receive it once she had left school. Her rich poetic and imaginative gifts were controlled by a very sharp and critical common sense. The latter also made her quite closed to suggestion. Only arguments had any influence on her, assertions were without effect. Her will was energetic, tenacious and persistent, sometimes heightened to such obstinacy that it would give way only out of kindness and consideration for others.

&gt; One of her principle traits was a sympathetic kindness. Even during her illness, she benefited greatly from the care and support she gave to some sick and poor people, for it allowed her to satisfy a strong drive. Her spirits always tended slightly to exaggeration, whether of joyfulness or grief, and as a consequence she was also somewhat moody. The element of sexuality was remarkably undeveloped: the patient, whose life became transparent to me in a way that seldom happens between people, had never been in love, and not once in the mass of hallucinations that occurred during her illness did this element of the inner life emerge...

&gt;...The course of the illness falls into several distinct phases. They are as follows:

&gt; A)	Latent incubation. From mid-July 1880 to approximately 10 December. This  case was exceptional because it afforded so complete an insight into a phase that in most cases escapes us, and for this reason alone its pathological interest could not be overestimated. I will expound on this part of the history later.

&gt; B)	Manifest illness: a peculiar kind of psychosis, paraphasia, *stabismus convergens* [convergent squint], sever visual disturbance, paralyzing contractures, complete paralysis in the upper right and both lower extremities, partial paralysis in the upper left extremity, paresis of the neck muscles. A gradual reduction in the contracture of the right extremities. Some improvement, interrupted by a sever psychical trauma (death of the father) in April, after which

&gt; C)	A period of continual somnambulism ensues, which then alternates with more normal states; continuation of a series of chronic symptoms until December 1881.

&gt; D)	Gradual winding down of mental states and symptoms until June 1882. [p25-26][#Freud:kVwxqGOZ]

Breuer took over her care during the period of 'manifest illness,'  during which, Anna O. slept for great periods of time ('somnambulism'), but when she awoke in the evening, she would complain of 'torment.' Her speech lost all grammatical structure ('paraphasia') and she would piece together words and phrases from the five distinct languages she spoke, producing an incomprehensible jargon. This same jargon appeared in writing, so Breuer knew that it was not a disfunction of the physical mechanism of speech.

In the early spring of 1881, Anna O fell mute for a period of two weeks. At this point, Breuer claims that he 

&gt;“knew she had taken great offense at something and had resolved to say nothing about it. When I guessed as much and forced her to talk about it, the inhibition, which had until then made it impossible for her to speak about anything else either, disappeared.” [p 29][#Freud:kVwxqGOZ]

After her father's death, her illness became much more severe. Breuer noticed, however, that her periods of sleep in the later afternoon, during which she was 'tormented' by hallucinations, resembled hypnotic states.  He decided to preemptively hypnotize her and prompt her to 'talk through' these tormenting phantasies. The symptoms subsided quickly.  The day after a session, she would become 'quite calm' and 'agreeable, obedient, industrious and even in good spirits'. The second day after a session she would be 'increasingly moody, contrary and disagreeable, and this worsened on the third.'  Anna O. named these sessions (in English) the 'talking cure' and 'chimney-sweeping.'  Breuer preferred the more sophisticated 'cathartic procedure.'

Breuer communicated this to his friend Sigmund Freud, who offered to co-author a paper laying out the findings. That paper, titled 'The Psychic Mechanism of Hysterical Phenomena,' first appeared in 1893, but was republished as the first chapter of Freud and Breuer's *Studies on Hysteria* [1895][#Freud:kVwxqGOZ]. In it, Freud and Breuer propose a new form of hysteria, called 'traumatic hysteria', which they conjecture is always connected to some traumatic event that evokes the syndrome. They further hypothesize that the traumatic event can be unavailable to the conscious, reflective mind of patient---i.e. be unconscious---yet still be causally responsible for the hysterical symptoms.  Moreover, they hypothesize that making the patient aware of the trauma, via Breuer’s 'cathartic procedure' using hypnosis if necessary, alleviates the hysteria.

##### Freud: The foundation of psychoanalysis

The seeds of psychoanalysis were planted by Charcot and Breuer, but they did not develop into a full-fledged system of Psychiatry until Freud worked independently. Building on his theory of unconscious trauma to explain hysteria, Freud hypothesizes that traumatic events may manifest themselves in the mind indirectly in the form of symbols. He then went on to realize that the fantasy lives of the psychotic are full of such symbols, and recovering the original trauma requires investigation of the mechanisms of symbolization.

It was this realization that gives us the basis for psychoanalysis, for it is this realization that allows Freud to argue that the hallucinations and fantasies experiences by the psychotic are not significantly different from the dreams of the sane. Whereas prior to Freud, dreams and hallucinations were thought to be without meaning, after Freud they were seen as full of symbolic representations, the meanings of which were available empirically through systematic investigation of the mechanisms of psychological representation. Freud's proposed mechanisms are introduced in the &lt;!--\ref{classical}--&gt; section on page &lt;!--\pageref{classical}--&gt; of the game book.

The barrier between the mentally ill and the mentally healthy had been permanently broken. No longer does the theory of psychiatry apply only to those who cannot be helped by medicine. Now the theory applies to everyone: a healthy person could become ill through unhealthy habits of mental representation, and ill people could become healthy through the process of discovering their habits of mental representation and recognizing their unconscious traumas.  

This conflation of psychiatric conditions and normal life left Freud in the precarious position of having to define 'mental illness.'  He did so thus:
&lt;!--\begin{apatextbox}{Freud’s Definition of Mental Illness}--&gt; Symptoms—and of course we are dealing now with psychical (or psychogenic) symptoms and psychical illness—are acts detrimental, or at least useless, to the subject's life as a whole, often complained by him as unwelcome and bringing unpleasure or suffering to him. [p. 445][#Freud:QdOvAgyZ]

&lt;!--\label{def:freud}\end{apatextbox}--&gt;


**Neurosis v. Psychosis.** One of the hallmarks of Freud's theory is his thesis that the there is no hard and fast distinction to be made between the mentally ill and the mentally healthy. His *Introductory Lectures* are structured to introduce the reader to psychopathology in everyday life before extending the analysis of common activities to psychotics and neurotic patients.  As such, there are no hard and fast definitions of psychosis and neurosis.

During the course of normal development of mentally healthy adults, the ego must become 'reasonable': it must no longer let “itself be governed by the pleasure principle, but obeys the reality principle, which also at bottom seeks to obtain pleasure, but pleasure which is assured through taking account of reality, even though it is pleasure postponed and diminished.” (p. 444) A neurotic's ego fails to make this transition, and gets stuck at one point in development.  Thus, the neurotic's libido and ego are still struggling in a child-like way, but the contents of the struggle have been transformed into objects of adulthood. Neurotic symptoms are the “outcome of a conflict which arises over a new method of satisfying the libido” (p. 446) and a person is ill from neurosis only if “his ego has lost the capacity to allocate his libido in some way” (p. 480). A psychotic patient, however, has lost the battle for the reality principle, and the libido has created its own reality.

The object of a neurosis, then, is relevant to the diagnosis only insofar as it is a stand-in for the actual conflict by the mechanisms of repression, reaction formation, isolation, etc.  According to Freud: “clinical psychiatry takes little notice of the outward form or content of individual symptoms, but psychoanalysis takes matters up at precisely that point and has established in the first place the fact that symptoms have a sense and are related to the patient's experience.” (p. 318)

See Lectures 22 and 23 of the *Introductory Lectures* for a full discussion of neurosis and its origins.
##### The Clark Lectures

In 1909, G. Stanley Hall, first president of the American Psychological Association, invited Freud and Jung to give a series of lectures at Clark University. The conference itself was a major moment in the intellectual history of America, as such luminaries as William James, Franz Boas, Adolf Meyer and E.B. Tichner were in attendance, as well as the famed Anarchist Emma Goldman.

After the lectures, James Jackson Putnam, a neurologist in New York City, invited Freud and Jung to retire to his family's Adirondack 'great camp' for the weekend. ([#Prochnik:FiwLnN1z])  Putnam became an important advocate for psychoanalysis in the United States, establishing its legitimacy as a treatment for hysteria. While there are articles prior to 1909 on psychoanalysis (notably one by Putnam himself in 1906), we don't find significant discussion of  psychoanalysis in the mainstream journals of Psychology until after the Clark lectures. An effort to convince the American public of the scientific nature of psychoanalysis was mounted by Putnam camp attendees A.A. Brill, founder of the New York Psychoanalytic Society, and Ernest Jones, student of Freud. By 1916, Jones had published 20 articles, notes and reviews in the Journal of Abnormal Psychology offering or advocating for psychoanalysis.

Putnam and Freud went on to become close friends, and Putnam spent much of the rest of his career attempting to professionalize and regularize the practice of psychiatry. He founded the American Psychoanalytic Association (APsaA) in 1911, which is still active today. His posthumously published *Addresses on Psychoanalysis*, which contains a preface by Freud himself, not only seeks to introduce Freudian theory to his scientific community, but also to dispel misunderstanding gained “through the gossip of prejudice and misconception” [p. 3][#Putnam:1921uc].

Putnam’s influence here cannot be understated. Putnam introduced psychoanalytic ideas to the budding field of medical neurology. His position as a medical doctor at Harvard gave psychoanalysis legitimacy as a medical practice in America, and his stature in the neurological community helped to assuage any doubts about the lack of a physical basis for the hypothetical entities posited by Freud's structural hypothesis.

The story is not all smooth sailing. In 1916, the Princeton philosopher and psychologist Warren Fite reviewed of Jung's *Psychology of the Unconscious* for *The Nation*, writing that it “presents some five hundred-odd pages of incoherence and obscenity in the form of a psycho-analytic interpretation of the experiences of a sentimental young American woman.” [#Fite:1916tk] The fact that the United States was at war with Germany didn't help the psychoanalytic cause: Christine Ladd-Franklin, a student of C.S. Peirce and protege of no less than Hermann Helmholtz as well as one of the first women in the APA, called Freud's theory the product of an “undeveloped... German mind.”

What followed is a history of tension between those in the psychological and psychoanalytic communities. Helped by the military's preference for psychoanalysts in the treatment of 'shell-shock' during WWI and 'combat fatigue' in WWII, psychoanalysis gained credibility in the eyes of the American public.

#### Classification of Mental Illness, 1918-1952

In 1917 during its annual meeting in New York, the American Medico-Psychological Association (now the American Psychiatric Association) in cooperation with the National Commission on Mental Hygiene formed a committee on statistics and charged it with creating a guide for classifying mental illness. The resulting document, *Statistical Manual for the Use of Institutions for the Insane*, was published in 1918 and adopted around the nation. It is available freely on google books. The manual outlined 21 medical-psychological categories, displayed in table &lt;!--\ref{table: 1918Classification}--&gt;:

In 1928, the New York Academy of Medicine invited the Public Health Service, the Army and Navy Medical Departments and the American Hospital Association to collaborate on a standard nomenclature of disease. That standard was first published in 1933 as *A Standard Classified Nomenclature of Disease*, generally referred to as *The Standard*, and was widely used until at least the 1960s. [#Houts:2000vp]

 In its original form, it used the following ten categories, as displayed in table &lt;!--\ref{table: 1933Classification}--&gt;:

&lt;!-- \begin{longtable}[!t]{ | p{13.8cm}  | }
\hline
0 Diseases due to prenatal influences\\
1 Diseases due to lower plant and animal parasites\\
2 Diseases due to higher plant and animal parasites\\
3 Diseases due to intoxication\\
4 Diseases due to trauma or physical agents\\
5.0 Diseases due to circulatory disturbances\\
5.5 Diseases due to disturbances of innervation or of psychic control\\
6 Diseases due to or consisting of static mechanical abnormality (obstruction; calculus; displacement and gross changes in form etc., due to unknown cause).\\
7 Diseases due to disorders of metabolism, growth or nutrition\\
8 New growths\\
9 Diseases due to unknown or uncertain causes, the structural reaction (generative, infiltrative, inflammatory, proliferate, sclerotic, or reparative) to which is manifest; and hereditary and familial diseases of this nature.\\
X Diseases due to unknown or uncertain causes, the functional reaction to which is alone manifest; and hereditary and familial diseases of this nature.\\ \hline

You may notice that the medical classification is entirely based on the origin or cause of a condition ('Diseases **due to...**’), not the symptoms. In the &lt;!--\ref{table: 1918Classification}--&gt;, classification system, mental diseases are classified by the Freudian terms 'psychosis' and 'neurosis', except for melancholy and dimentia.

During WWII, psychiatrists classified patients according to the standards of the branch of the armed forces for which they worked. In 1943, Brigadier General William C. Menninger issued a bulletin called “Medical 203” that laid the foundations for medical classification of mental illness. The Navy, Army and Veterans affairs branches all used slightly different diagnostic criteria and classifications.

The International Statistical Classification of Diseases (ICD) included a taxonomy of mental disorders for the first time in 1949. Its classification system is displayed in table &lt;!--\ref{table: 1949Classification}--&gt;:

In the interest of unifying these different classification schema, the American Psychiatric Association voted to create the first Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM). The nomenclature committee adapted the Medical 203 bulletin into the DSM and circulated it to a randomly selected sample of the membership (10%). When it was overwhelmingly approved by those who replied, the APA adopted it as the standard for diagnosis in medical treatment of psychological disorders. It is included as Appendix &lt;!--\ref{app: DSMI}--&gt;
The first DSM distinguished between “Disorders caused by or associated with impairment of brain tissue function,” “Mental Deficiency,”  “Disorders of psychogenic origin or without clearly defined physical cause or structural change in the brain” and “Nondiagnostic Terms for Hospital Record.”  This fourth category included “Alcoholic intoxication (simple drunkenness),” and “Dead on admission.”  It is the third category, those without a physical cause, that is of the most interest to us. They are displayed here in table &lt;!--\ref{table: 1952Classification}--&gt;

Notice that while the major classification here is 'Psychotic Disorders', the word "reaction" appears in 41 of the 48 diagnoses. See the overview of Classical Psychanalysis in section &lt;!--\ref{classical}--&gt; on page &lt;!--\pageref{classical}--&gt;.

The APA published the revised DSM-II in 1968. It is included as Appendix &lt;!--\ref{app: DSMII}--&gt;..

#### The Rise of Psychopharmacology

Because psychoanalysis tended to be confined to clinical, military settings in the US, a kind of stable truce—the more cynical might even say a 'cold war’---settled over the conflict between behaviorism and psychoanalysis. By and large, psychoanalysis confined itself to the medical setting; while behaviorism confined itself to pure research. There were, no doubt, volleys across the bow of one or the other from time to time. But until Skinner's wide-ranging proposals for behaviorism as social reformation, there were few open hostilities.

Much of the scientific credibility for psychoanalysis turned on its success in treating psychotic patients.  Medical Doctors tend not to worry so much about the putative mechanism of a therapy, so long as that therapy works for the individual patient in question.  It isn't uncommon for a drug to help some small portion of the population and fail with another.  Generalizations to universal laws are uncommon in the practice of medicine, and much the of time the cause of a certain medical condition remains unknown, even if we understand how to cure it (consider cancers like lymphoma, for example). Thus, when psychologists objected that psychoanalysis did not generalize, its mechanisms were untestable, and as a treatment it was highly individualistic, medical practitioners were not overly impressed.  

All of that changed starting in 1955 when Wallace Labs began marketing the world's first popular psychotropic for the treatment of anxiety: *Miltown*. The Wallace Lab claimed that *Miltown* controlled anxiety without reducing mental function, allowing patients to return to their normal lives. It was quickly followed by *Trofranil*, an antidepressant, in 1959; *Librium*, an anti-anxiety medication, in 1960; and *Valium* in 1963. In 1969, the neurologist Oliver Sacks administered a new drug L-DOPA to patients who had been comatose for almost 40 years. They woke up.  His experiences were immortalized in the book and subsequent movie, *Awakenings.* [#Sacks:1974um]

These drugs did—in short order—what years of psychoanalysis, hypnosis, electro-shock therapy (the decedent of Beard's treatments) and confinement could not: they allowed patients with crippling anxiety to return to normal or close-to-normal functioning.

### Setting the stage for 1971

In 1961, Thomas Langer and Stanley Michael conducted 2-hour interviews with 1,660 individuals chose at random from the streets of New York. This was, in many ways, the first wide-scale study of the psychology of people *not already* seeking treatment for psychological trouble.  Their findings are quite simple: socio-economic status and age explain most of an individual's mental health. 

 The study was revolutionary. As S. H. Kranes of the University of Chicago said "[this study] is a pioneer in obtaining 'objective' information.  Psychiatry is too promote to the philosophical other than the factual." [#Kraines:1964fy]

Since the origin of psychiatry, there has been a distinction made between those disorders that can be directly attributable to a biological dysfunction of the brain and those that cannot. The former were classified as 'neurological,' and the latter 'psychiatric.'  It is this inability to find a biological etiology of the disorder defines the domain of psychiatry.

Two major trends are appearing in psychology and psychiatry: 

1. The current psychoanalytic taxonomy of mental states is based on conjectures and assumptions based on a few case studies, and they have not been tested against evidence and observation.

2. Psychiatric disorders must have a physical component, and hence, the line between psychiatry and neurology may be breaking down.

In light of these trends, what will happen to the field of psychiatry?

            <Comments>See, e.g. Treatise on Insanity, p. 46
The story of how Pinel became interested in insanity is frequently retold. Like Newton's apple, it is probably something of a myth, although there may be some core of truth. Here it is, as told by himself in A Treatise on Insanity:
	The loss of a friend, who became insane through excessive love of glory, in 1783, and the ineptitude of pharmaceutic preparations to the mind elated, as his was, with a high sense of its independence, enhanced my admiration of the judicous precepts of the ancients, and made me regret that I had it not then in my power to put them in practice. (p 52)
From a letter by Marx 1846:
	...in 1785, he had the misfortune to lose a young man to whom he was much attached, and whose reason became affected through excessive study and abstinence. This unfortunate person, after his return to his family, became maniacal, one evening he escaped from his father's house into the neighboring forest and was devoured by wolves; a few torn rags were found the following day, and near them a copy of the Phaedra covered with blood.
And by Lisa Appignanesi in 2009:
A shy provincial like himself, the friend had fallen into despair and then 'mania' when his legal aspirations failed to materialize. Unable to help the younger man once he had all but ceased to eat, Pinel had brought him to the Hôtel-Dieu where a treatment of baths and food seemed to restore him. But his worried family intervened and took him home before he was quite well. The youth escaped their hold, fled to the woods and was found dead only after the wolves had got him. [p. 58][#Marx:1847vc]
From a letter of honor, included in Marx 1846: “He who walks in an odoriferous flower-garden, which had formerly been a pestilential swamp, will best be able to appreciate what you effected in madhouses. Formerly an atmosphere almost stifling, damp rooms, the clank of chains, the cries of those under the lash, the hoarse growl of the rough attendants, the desperate frenzy of the ill-used patients; these succeeded by clean apartments, the greatest humanity in personal attentions, and an atmosphere of peace and confidence throughout the whole establishment. [p. 210][#Marx:1847vc]
See Roberty Fleury's 'Dr. Phillippe Pinel at the Salpêtrière' (1795)
See, e.g p. 3, Section 4, p 134. Also, from the Marx (1846): Every delusion is the result of confused modes of thinking; wrong and crime originate in ignorance.” [p. 212][#Marx:1847vc]
Each humour had an associated personality type. Imbalance in a given humour was thought to be the cause of imbalances in mood or personality: people with too much black bile were melancholic, yellow bile choleric (full of energy), blood sanguine (impulsive), and phlegm phlegmatic (emotional). See Aristotle's Problems Bk 3, Section1 Galen's De temperamentis, and Avicenna's The Canon of Medicine for more detail.
The modern reader of A Treatise on Insanity is impressed by the number of times that Pinel stresses these two features of mental illness. We take both of these for granted to such an extent that the work can seem highly repetitive and redundant. But they were radical theses in the late 18th century, and Pinel's thoroughness in covering the topics no doubt reflects the importance of these thesis in his own mind. (Cite Data – number of pages, examples, etc.).
And hence, the frequently-used trope of science fiction dating back to Frankenstein that the dead can be brought back to life with electricity.
For more, see [#Beard:1875wp]
In his 'History of the Psychiatric Movement', Freud writes: “...It was the case of the young married couple from the far East. The wife was a great sufferer and the husband was impotent, or exceedinly awkward. I head Charcot repeat: “Tâchez donc, je vous assure vous y arriverez.” Brouardel, who spoke less distinctly, must have expressed his astonishment that such symptoms as those of the young wife should have appeared as a result of such circumstances, for Charcot said suddenly and with great vivacity: “Mais, dans de cas pareils, c'est toujours la chose génital, toujours—toujours-toujours.” And while saying that, he crossed his hands in his lap an jumped up and down several times, with the vivacity peculiar to him.” [p. 937-938][#Freud:1938vi]

We know that George Beard and Silas Wier Mitchell had the same view at this point, and that Freud was familiar with their work on ‘hysteria.’  What is unknown, given that Freud's retelling of this anecdote is based on his memory alone, is the accuracy of this story. It might be the case, and it might just be Freud misattributing a theory he picked up from Beard and Wier Mitchell to his mentor years after the fact.
See, for example, Drellich, Marvin G. “Classical Psychoanalytic School” in [#Arieti:1974tm]
I am simplifying here a bit. While Freud is commonly believed to originate the idea that dreams and psychotic hallucinations were best understood on a continuum, the ideas appears in the work of the British associationist Alexander Bain. See, e.g. [p. 45][#Bain:1903tf]
The distinction between neurosis and psychosis has always been controversial. Consider Pavlov's comment in his 1927 lectures: “Contemporary medicine distinguishes "nervous" and "psychic" disturbances-neuroses and psychoses, but this distinction is, of course, only arbitrary. No real line of demarcation can be drawn between these two groups: it is impossible to imagine a deviation of higher activities from normal without a functional or structural disturbance of the cortex.” [Lecture 23][#Pavlov:1946ws]
See, for example [#Jacoby:2009tt]

This section is written for the contemporary reader, not the ‘character’ you’ll be playing. The standards of what makes a good experiment have not changed significantly since the mid 1970s, so there should be no historical anachronisms contained herein.

The image to the right (figure &lt;!--\ref{fig: scientificreasoningexample}--&gt;) is a clipping from the Washington Post published in 2004. It’s one of these succinct summations of scientific research that appear all the time in the media---there is even a website (http://kill-or-cure.herokuapp.com/) that tracks all the things that the British Tabloid *The Daily Mail* has said either causes or cures cancer.

So what, exactly, is the claim being made here? What evidence is given in support of that claim? If we take the main headline

&gt; Dogged crying and lower IQs are linked

as the central claim---the conclusion, as it were,---of the study that was performed, what would count as evidence in support? Against? 

What, exactly, does it mean to be 'linked' anyway? How are they linked? Does increasing one cause increases in the other?

Fortunately, we have the original journal article for this one available, so I’ll quote the abstract:
&lt;!--\begin{apatextbox}{Abstract from --&gt; [#Rao:2004ku] &lt;!--}--&gt;
**BACKGROUND:**

Long term studies of cognitive development and colic have not differentiated between typical colic and prolonged crying.

**OBJECTIVE:**

To evaluate whether colic and excessive crying that persists beyond 3 months is associated with adverse cognitive development.

**DESIGN:**

Prospective cohort study. A sample of 561 women was enrolled in the second trimester of pregnancy. Colic and prolonged crying were based on crying behaviour assessed at 6 and 13 weeks. Children's intelligence, motor abilities, and behaviour were measured at 5 years (n = 327). Known risk factors for cognitive impairment were ascertained prenatally, after birth, at 6 and 13 weeks, at 6, 9, and 13 months, and at 5 years of age.

**RESULTS:**

Children with prolonged crying (but not those with colic only) had an adjusted mean IQ that was 9 points lower than the control group. Their performance and verbal IQ scores were 9.2 and 6.7 points lower than the control group, respectively. The prolonged crying group also had significantly poorer fine motor abilities compared with the control group. Colic had no effect on cognitive development.

**CONCLUSIONS:**

Excessive, uncontrolled crying that persists beyond 3 months of age in infants without other signs of neurological damage may be a marker for cognitive deficits during childhood. Such infants need to be examined and followed up more intensively.
&lt;!--\end{apatextbox}--&gt;


While the journalist used the word ‘linked,’  the scientific paper makes slightly different claim: that crying “may be a marker” for cognitive deficits during childhood.  This word change---from ‘marker’ to ‘link’---has implications that demand investigation.

The former claim---that ‘dogged crying’ *is linked* to lower IQ---suggests a causal claim: that if you could just stop the child from crying, the child’s IQ would remain normal.  The second---that crying *may be a marker*---suggests that crying is an early sign of an underlying problem that manifests as lower IQ at a later date. The first implies one-way a causal relationship, the second, that both are caused by an underlying problem.

&lt;!--\newthought{The process of drawing upon information,}--&gt; whether acquired through simple observation or through experiment, to answer questions is the crux of the activity of scientific reasoning. The answers to these questions are what scientists refer to as *hypotheses*.&lt;!--\marginnote{A ‘hypothesis’ is often defined as an 'educated guess'. This overly-simple definition is really only suitable as a starting point. A hypothesis is a conjecture about the way some phenomenon in the world is or behaves. It might be about the origin of the universe, or the mechanisms of memory, but in either case, the hypothesis claims that something is a certain way. If we discover that the thing is not the way the hypothesis claimed, we have disconfirmed the hypothesis.}--&gt; In a scientific investigation, one tests and rejects various hypotheses. 

Look back at the ‘Dogged crying’ abstract. You should note that this is study **not** an experiment. The authors of the study did **nothing** other than observe: they made no interventions to the babies or the mothers. They merely separated them into two groups, and measured those groups 5 years later.

 Any member of the APA may read a paper, provided that it has been accepted by the program committee.

 ###### A nonmember of the APA

may read a paper provided that he is sponsored by a member of the  APA and provided that his qualifications and the quality of his paper are acceptable to the program committee. The APA member who agrees to sponsor a nonmember must submit the abstract of the nonmember's paper to the chairman of the program committee with an accompanying description of the nonmember's scientific qualifications plus the names of recognized scientific societies in which the nonmember holds membership.

 ###### Symposia and invited addresses

The program committee may invite distinguished nonmembers to contribute to the program as special speakers or as participants in symposia. Because symposia often involve topics extending beyond the competence of APA members, it is frequently desirable to include nonmembers as participants.  Acceptance of a distinguished speaker or of a symposium proposal by the Program Committee constitutes the require sponsorship of nonmember participants.
 #####Limits of Individual Participation

Over the past several years the APA's Board of Directors working with the program committee has developed several ground rules for the limits of individual participation in the annual convention program. These rules were designed to ensure the widest possible participation by APA members and also to prevent troublesome conflicts in the time schedule. Briefly, the rules have been that each member may present no more than one volunteered paper and that each member may, in addition, participate in no more than one additional session such as a symposium, discussion group, and the like. It is still strongly recommended that maximum participation be limited to one symposium or discussion group plus one paper.

 #####Individual Reports

Unless otherwise indicated, four ten-minute papers will be scheduled for each 50-minute session. In instances of multiple authorship the person whose name is listed first will be expected to present the paper.

A paper previously read at the Annual APA Convention may not be read again, unless it is a substantial elaboration (additional findings, etc.). Two papers which report highly similar findings from a cooperative project may not be read at the convention.

The APA Board of Directors have voted that, for reasons of economy, this rule should be followed: Abstracts printed in the American Psychologist are limited to 100 words. However, it is recognized that more detailed information will be needed by the Program Committee for use in the selection of papers.  The procedures for research reports and other individual reports are described below.

 ######Research Reports

*Each author of a research report must submit a 100-word abstract (1 copy) for publication if the paper is accepted, and also a 300-word summary (4 copies) for committee publication.*  If the author desires, tables presenting results may be submitted with the 300-word summary. Not more than one page of tables should be submitted. This means that all the data should have been obtained and the analysis completed at the time the abstract and summary are submitted to the Program Committee.

 ######Other individual reports

Theoretical papers, case studies, and the like are perfectly acceptable for the program.  *The 100-word abstract of a non-experimental paper must, however, be accompanied by a manuscript of the complete paper in draft form.* The complete manuscript is required in order that the Program Committee may be in a better position to judge the contribution to the program.

 ######Form of abstracts and summaries

All abstracts and summaries must be typed on one side of the paper only, double-spaced throughout and on 8 1/2” X 11” paper.


*The 100-word abstract*

The purpose of the published abstract is to provide information concerning the psychological relevance of the paper. .. primarily to justify its scientific validity. Hence abstracts should be concerned with content … rather than with method and technique unless the purpose of the paper is essentially methodological). Examples of good short abstracts from many different fields may be found in *Psychological Abstracts*.

Abstracts must be limited in length to 100 words (not counting title, author and institution). Longer abstracts will not be printed but will be listed by title only. Abstracts should not contain tables, drawings, footnotes, or bibliographic entries, as such material will not be printed.

The following outline should be followed in preparing the abstract:

Title of Paper:
Author(s):				Sponsor (if any):
Institution(s):
     *Text of abstract* (not to exceed 100 words)

Because the 100-word abstract will be sent to the printer, do not underline or type anything with all capital letters. The type written abstract should be checked and proofread carefully, since it will be printed in the form in which it is submitted.  Authors are urged to give careful thought to the visual aides that will best facilitate presentations of their data.  If slides are used, members are urged to consider presenting graphic and tabular material on paper.  As a new procedure, authors of accepted papers will be asked to indicate their preference for audio-visual support.

*The 300-word summary*

The text of the summary will normally include a statement of the problem, subjects used, procedure, results and conclusions.

Summaries must be limited in length to 300 words (not counting title, author, and institution). The 300-word summary may be accompanied by not more than one page of supplementary tables, drawings, footnotes, etc.

The form for submitting the 300-word summary should be exactly the same as for the 100-word abstract except, of course, for the longer text.

Four copies of the 300-word summary and the supplementary tables, etc. are required. *Author, sponsor, and institution should appear on the first copy only.* The first copy is the one that will be used by the Program Committee Chair in the creation of the Conference Proceedings. The other three copies without identifying data will be used by the Program Committee for judging the acceptability of the paper.

###### Where to send abstracts and summaries

Copies of the abstract and summary of a volunteered paper should be sent to the chair of the Program Committee.

##### Symposia

A symposium provides for several prepared papers on a single theme or problem. It is an excellent form of meeting if the aim is to bring to an audience several diverse or even contradictory views, presented by a number of “experts.” The expectation would be that all papers would first be read; then there would be a substantial period for interchanging of views among the speakers (and invited discussants, if desired); finally, a brief period for questions or points raised from the floor. It is important to plan the time so that there is real interaction among participants after the papers. In order to realize the unique value of the symposium the chairman should select speakers at an early date, arrange for the participants to exchange papers ell in advance of the session, and ensure that ample time is allotted for discussion among the participants and contributors from the audience

###### Initiation of symposia

Any member of the APA may suggest a symposium topic to the chairman of the Program Committee. Such proposals must be made at an early date as a successful symposium requires much planning and correspondence. A member may also submit a fully organized symposium for the Program Committee's consideration.

 ###### Form of symposium proposals

*Suggestions to the Program Committee*

When a member only suggests but does not organize a symposium, he should indicate the title of the topic for discussion, comment on the significance of the topic, and list the names and addresses of the proposed chairman and other participants. Such suggestions should be sent to the appropriate divisional program chairman well in advance of the deadline to allow for ample time for planning.

*Member-Organized symposia*

A member may organize a proposed symposium in complete detail and present it for approval to the Program Committee. Each such proposal should indicate the title of the symposium and list the names of the chairman and participants, together with the titles of participants' contributions, if these titles are to be published. *Five copies of the completed symposium plans must be submitted to the Program Committee by the deadline.*

*Symposia organized by the Program Committee*

Symposia may be organized independently by the Program Committee or in response to the requests of members.

##### Special Programs
The Program Committee should feel free to try new kinds of programs.  Forums, discussion groups, panels, round tables, conferences, and workshops are often valuable alternatives to papers and symposia. Members are invited to send suggestions for new types of programs to the Program Committee. Special sessions should be suggested well in advance of the deadline to allow for ample time for planning. Procedures for initiating special programs should follow in general the procedures for initiating symposia.

##### Miscellaneous Meetings and Special Sessions

APA boards, committees, etc. desiring business meetings must send to the Chairman of the APA Program Committee by the deadline a statement of estimated attendance, time required, time and day preferred and whether arrangements for luncheon and dinner are desired.

Luncheons, dinners and social hours may be scheduled for non-APA organizations if they send their request to the chairman of the APA Program Committee by the deadline.  Such scheduled events will be listed in the condensed program.

##### Audio-Visual Presentations

APA members, commercial film producers or distributors who wish to present new films, film strips, or other audio-visual aids (including sound recordings) should make the Program Committee aware of this fact at the deadline.  The committee will review and select the audio-visual materials which are to be presented as part of the APA program.

##### Exhibits

APA members are encouraged to exhibit apparatus, teaching aids, and other materials of scientific and applied interest. Commercial agencies are invited to request arrangements for exhibits. All commercial exhibitors will be charged for space. Those wishing to arrange for exhibits must write to the chairman of the Program Committee.

Sample call for research grants.
&lt;!--
\begin{apatextbox}{Call for Research Grants} --&gt;
#### Call for Research Grants

##### Introduction

The Research Committee of the APA herein solicits proposals for research that will forward the disciplines of psychology and psychiatry. Note especially the deadlines, the form for abstracts of contributed papers, the forms for symposium proposals, and the proper persons to receive your correspondence. The pertinent references have been collected into the box on this page for your convenience.

Winners will be granted the support of the other members of the class for a period of one class session. The primary investigator must specify in the research proposal how the other students will participate: as subjects, participants, observers or confederates.


Winning grants will be determined by the Research Committee, in accordance with the criteria specified herein.  All proposals must be in line with the APA's ethical guidelines which are in force at the time of submission.

##### Research Supported

The APA seeks to advance the creation, communication and application of knowledge of the mind and behavior to benefit society and improve people's lives. The APA embraces scientific inquiry into all aspects of the human experience — from the functions of the brain to the actions of nations, from child development to care for the aged. And in every conceivable setting from scientific research centers to mental health care services, "the understanding of behavior" is the enterprise of psychologists.

Additionally, the APA aspires to advance the understanding of psychology and psychiatry as scientific disciplines. To that end, it will support any research that follows the standards of scientific inquiry and contributes to the central goals of the association.

It is imperative that all research supported by the APA must be accordance with the ethical guidelines published by the APA.  

##### Who May Submit Proposals

###### Members of the APA

Any member of the APA may submit a proposal for a research grant.  APA membership is limited to those meeting the definition of 'Psychologist' or 'Psychiatrist' used by the APA (see p. 10 of the gamebook).

###### Nonmembers of the APA

As the APA Research committee seeks to further the disciplines of Psychology and Psychiatry wherever they are practiced, the primary investigator of a grant need ot be a member of the APA. The primary investigator, however, must be a Psychologist or Psychiatrist as defined by the APA (see p. 10 of the gamebook).

###### Confederates, Observers and Assistants

Individuals working in psychological research should be engaged in some significant way with the academic pursuit of knowledge. Confederates, observers and assistants in research must therefore be students of psychology or psychiatry, if not psychologists or psychiatrists in their own right.

##### Limitations of Participation

A primary investigator may submit one (1) proposal annually. An individual may serve as a consultant, confederate, observer or assistant on any number of grant proposals in addition to proposing himself as a primary investigator.   

##### Form of the Proposal

######Introduction

Limited to 100 words, the introduction should specify the phenomenon you wish to examine and why. Briefly describe the phenomenon in general, and discuss how it relates to the study of the human mind and behavior.

######Background / Review

Briefly describe the history of research into this phenomenon, and why that history is insufficient. Summarize what is already known about the phenomenon, including the background information you gleaned during your literature review.

######Rationale

Describe the questions you are examining and explore any possible implications of your study. This includes listing the specific questions you are addressing, explaining how your research is related to the larger issues raised in the introduction. Specifically describe the claims, models or hypotheses you will evaluate with your research. Explain how your research will contribute to our understanding of the mind.

######Method and Design

Describe how you will go about collecting data and testing the questions you wish to examine. While novel methods are encouraged, the primary investigator must be able to specify the scientific validity of any methods proposed.

Method: How will you collect the data?

  Describe the general methodology you choose for your study, i.e. observational, experimental, etc.
* Explain why this method is the best method for this question.
*  Specify who will participate in your study, and why.
*  Describe the sample you would test and explain why you have chosen this sample. Include age, and language background and socio-economic information, if relevant to the design.
*Are there any participants you would exclude? Why, why not?

Design
* Describe what kinds of manipulations/variations you would make or test for in order to test your hypothesis(es).
* Describe the factors you would vary if you were presenting a person with stimulus sentences.
* Explain how varying these factors would allow you to confirm or disconfirm your hypotheses.
* Explain what significant differences you would need to find to confirm or disconfirm your hypothesis(es). In particular, how could your hypothesis(es) be disconfirmed by your data?
* Controls: What kinds of factors would you need to control for in your study?
* Describe what types of effects would be likely to occur which would make your results appear to confirm, or to disconfirm your hypothesis(es).
* Describe how you can by your design rule out or control for apparent effects.

Procedure
* How are you going to present the stimuli?
* What is the participant in the experiment going to do?

Analysis
* How will you analyze the results?
* What kind of results would confirm your hypothesis?
* What kind of results would disconfirm your hypothesis

###### Significance and Contribution


###### References


###### Where to send your proposal

Three copies of the proposal should be sent to the chairman of the Research committee.

##### Reports

Research findings should be submitted to the conference committee for the annual national conference following the awarding of the grant. The primary investigator should follow the guidelines found under 'Research Reports' (see &lt;!--\ref{researchreports}--&gt; on page &lt;!--\pageref{researchreports}--&gt;) in drafting his research report. Winning a grant in no way guarantees inclusion in the following year's conference program.

            <Text>#### Testing causal claims experimentally

In the ideal experiment, the only plausible explanation the two variable changing together is that they are causally connected. All other possible explanations—those based on the effects of other untested variables—have been ruled out by ‘controlling’ them.  The simplest form of an experiment has:

* an independent variable—the suspected cause—is manipulated.
&lt;!--\begin{thesis}[Independent variable]
Independent variable (manipulated): a variable of interest that is suspected to have a causal impact on the dependent variable, and is manipulated in an experiment to put this to the test.\newline
The ‘independent variable is sometimes called the suspected cause, the IV-manipulated or manipulated IV, or just ‘IV’, if context makes clear that this is a manipulated IV, not a measured IV.
\end{thesis}--&gt;

* a dependent variable—the suspected effect—is carefully measured. &lt;!--\begin{thesis}[Dependent variable]
Dependent variable: a variable of interest that is suspected to be affected by the independent variable, and is measured in experimental or correlational tests of this hypothesis.
\newline
The ‘dependent variable’ is also sometimes called the ‘DV’, the suspected effect.
\end{thesis}--&gt;

* extraneous variables are controlled

If the independent variable is *in fact* causally related to the dependent variable, then altering the value of the independent variable will produce changes in the value of the dependent variable. Moreover, these changes would not be found if the independent variable were not changed.

We will begin with the simplest case, one in which the causal relations are deterministic (that is, a change in the independent variable always produces the same change in the dependent variable). In such cases we sidestep the additional concerns with statistical analysis. But in later parts of this module we will consider such statistical relations as other factors that affect to validity of experimental demonstrations of causation.

&lt;!--\newthought{The core idea of an experiment}--&gt; is that the researcher *manipulates* the suspected cause and *measures* the suspected effect. By contrast, a study in which the researcher *measures* both the suspected cause and the suspected effect we call a “correlational study.” 

 If this manipulation produces an change in the value of the variable suspected of depending on the causal variable, we have the strongest evidence we can get that the suspected relation is genuinely causal. If it does not produce the expected changes, any correlation previously noted between the variables may be due to the fact that they are both caused by a third variable. To determine the real cause, we would then need to figure which other variable is the best candidate and manipulate it in a new experiment — perhaps repeating this cycle more than once until we hit the right variable.
Recall that we already have some useful terminology to use when causal hypotheses get put to the test in a research study. The suspected effect is the *dependent variable*. The suspected cause is the *independent variable*, which can be further specified as manipulated (if the study is an experiment), or measured (if the study is correlational, in the broad sense of that term that can include comparing group means as well as computing correlation coefficients). Since we are focusing on experiments in this module, the following are definitions of independent variable (manipulated) and dependent variable given in the margin at the right.

Whenever you see the term independent variable used by itself, one must determine whether it is manipulated or measured. This will be important when you evaluate the outcome of the study and ask how well it supports the suspected causal connection.

The most basic experiments manipulate only one independent variable and are limited to two values of that variable. That is, the independent variable is treated as the simplest kind of categorical variable—a binary variable—even if it is based on a score variable. Dependent variables usually are score variables, but need not be; methods of analysis are available for DVs at any level of measurement, all the way down to binary. 

&lt;!--\newthought{More complicated experiments}--&gt; may investigate multiple factors at the same time as well as multiple levels of the same factor. For example, if we were designing an experiment to examine the effects of both *diet* and *exercise* on *weight-loss.* This would be a two-factor study. And rather than just using two levels, we might use four levels of the exercise factor—none, light, moderate, and heavy—and three levels of the diet factor—high-protein, high- carbohydrate, and balanced. Exercise is a rank variable here and diet is categorical. Usually the statistical analysis will treat both as categorical, which is fine. However, even if the result were statistically significant, it would be hard to interpret results for exercise in which none and moderate led to weight loss and light and heavy did not.

In choosing the levels of a factor, sometimes experience or common sense are very helpful in avoiding results that are inadequate for your purpose or difficult to interpret. For example, if your hypothesis is that eating oatmeal affects cholesterol levels, manipulating diet such that one group gets one teaspoon per month more oatmeal than the other group is unlikely to produce an effect. At the other extreme, manipulating diet such that one group gets no oatmeal and the other must eat 50 cups a day would make the second group overweight and unhealthy. It would be more reasonable to contrast no oatmeal to an easily sustainable amount of oatmeal (perhaps two servings per week of ¾-cup of oatmeal) to a larger, but not ridiculous, amount of oatmeal (perhaps one cup per day).

&lt;!--\newthought{Some predictions can be tested}--&gt; by manipulating an independent variable once. What is required is that the relation between the independent and dependent variable be *deterministic*. That is, each time the independent variable takes a particular value, its effect on the dependent variable should be the same. For example, replacing water with mercury in 100 vacuum tubes in a given place and time should have the same effect (a reduction in height from 34 feet for water to 2 ½ feet for mercury). Research in the physical sciences is often of this type. A few replications may be included, but only as a precaution: the first case basically tells scientists whether or not a prediction is true.

When we study human minds, or any other complex systems, variability is unavoidable. Two individuals of the same species may respond differently to the same chemical, the same psychological stimulus, or the same social situation. So might the same individual at different times. In this situation, causal relations are nondeterministic and hence a single response by a single individual is just one bit of data. To test a hypothesis, many such bits of data must be obtained and, most often, will be averaged together to get an overall value of the dependent variable for each tested value of the independent variable.

Consider the hypothesis that oatmeal consumption is causally connected to the level of cholesterol in the blood, as indicated by the *black arrow* in the causal diagram below. Specifically, we predict that if people eat oatmeal their cholesterol will be lower than if they do not eat oatmeal. The *question mark* over the black arrow indicates that the causal relationship is merely hypothesized and awaits confirmation (or disconfirmation). The labeled *red arrow* indicates that we will test the hypothesis by manipulating (not just measuring) whether oatmeal is eaten.

&lt;!--\begin{marginfigure}

 \caption{Hypothetical experimental design---hypothesis only.}
\label{fig: cholestrol1}
\end{marginfigure}
--&gt;

This causal graph shows a simple experiment with two variables:
&lt;!-- \begin{longtable}[!t]{ | P{4cm} | P{3cm} | P{1.5cm} | }
\hline
\tahead{Type of Variable}&amp;\tahead{Variable}&amp;\tahead{Values} \\ \hline
Independent variable --- manipulated&amp;Eat oatmeal&amp;no,yes \\ \hline
Dependent variable&amp;Cholesterol level&amp;0-500 mg/dl \\ \hline
\caption{Variables in sample experimental design}
\label{table: variables}
\end{longtable}
--&gt;

Thus, researchers begin with a random (or representative) sample from the actual population, and divide that group into sub-samples. In one of the simplest experimental designs, the independent variable has one value that is thought to affect the dependent variable (often called the *treatment* condition) and a neutral value that is thought to have no effect (often called the *control condition*). The experimental manipulation involves delivering the value that is thought to affect the DV to one sample, known as the *experimental* or *treatment group*, and the neutral value to the other sample, known as the *control group*.

* The *experimental group* receives the experimental treatment. It functions as a sample of the hypothetical population in which everyone received the experimental treatment

* The *control group* acts as if it were a sample of the hypothetical population in which no one received the experimental treatment

To determine whether eating oatmeal affects cholesterol levels, we will focus on the difference between the means for the variable cholesterol level for both the experimental and control group and determine whether the difference is statistically significant. If it is, we conclude that eating oatmeal ¾ cup of oatmeal per day does cause lower cholesterol. If, on the other hand, there is no difference or the difference is too small to be statistically significant, we conclude that this study failed to provide evidence of a causal connection.

&lt;!--\newthought{Generally only one or a few variables}--&gt; are used to differentiate the experimental from the control group. But there are many other variables on which individuals may very. For example, if you were a subject in the cholesterol study, other factors in your life may have changed during the period you were eating cholesterol every day.

\end{marginfigure}
--&gt;Maybe you took up ultimate frisbee during this time, and the vigorous exercise was responsible. Or you were taking a very difficult course, and studying hard made the difference. Thus, from your results alone we cannot distinguish between &lt;!--\fullref{fig: cholestrol-withauxiliary}--&gt;.


These additional variables are known as *extraneous variables*. In many instances we can be pretty confident that these additional variables will not affect the outcome of the study. For example, deciding to dye your hair or acquiring a cat is not likely to affect your cholesterol levels. But in some cases the variable just might be a causal factor for the dependent variable under investigation. If it does influence the outcome of the study, it is known as a *confounding variable*.

&lt;!--\begin{thesis}[Confounding Variables]\label{thesis:confoundingvariables}Confounding variable: an extraneous variable that co-varies in the experiment with the IV or DV; if it happens to be causally related to the IV or DV, the internal validity of the experiment (the ability of the experiment to test what it tries to test) is compromised. \newline
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD
A confounding variable is frequently simply called a ‘confound.’\end{thesis}--&gt;


&lt;!--\newthought{Confounding variables can arise}--&gt; at many different points in the experiment. There may be differences between the subjects comprising the experimental and control group. If some other variable is inequality distributed across the two experimental groups, it could be the cause of the difference observed in the DV. 

If the difference is between subjects, the variables are known as *subject variables.*

If the difference is between the procedures followed for the two groups, the variables are known as *procedural variables.*

&lt;!--\newthought{It often takes real detective work}--&gt; to identify confounds in an experiment. Take the case of Wilhelm von Osten, who in 1900 purchased an arab stallion from Russia named Hans. Convinced that animals were more intelligent than usually thought, von Osten set out to teach Hans simple arithmetic. Von Osten presented arithmetic problems to Hans on a chalkboard, and Hans responded by taping his foot the appropriate number of times. Hans seemed to be able to solve even fairly complicated problems including the taking of square roots. Although many were skeptical, numerous mathematicians were brought in to test the horse, and some even concluded that his mathematical abilities equaled those of 14 year old school children.

&lt;!--\begin{figure*}\includegraphics{../images/CleverHans.jpg}\caption{Clever Hans---By Karl Krall (Karl Krall, Denkende Tiere, Leipzig 1912, Tafel 2) Public domain, via Wikimedia Commons}\label{fig:cleverhans}\end{figure*}--&gt;

&lt;!--\begin{marginfigure}
\begin{center}\includegraphics{../images/cleverhansarticle.png}\end{center}
\caption{Article reporting on Clever Hans, from Democrat and Chronicle, Rochester NY, published Aug 5, 1906.}
\label{fig:cleverhansarticle}
\end{marginfigure}--&gt;To answer skeptics, von Osten brought together a group of two zoologists, a psychologist, a horse trainer, and a circus manager to study Hans over several weeks. Hans performed brilliantly until the psychologist, Oskar Pfungst, varied the experimental setup to conceal the problem from all the humans in the room. The person who wrote the problem on the board was required to leave before the horse entered. 

Under these conditions, Hans dropped from scoring 9 out of 10 to 1 out of 10. This suggested that Hans was picking up a subtle, inadvertent cue from one of the humans and using that to decide when to stop tapping his foot.

Once it became clear that there was some other cue Hans was using, interest in him diminished. But if you were interested in discovering just what cue Hans was responding to, more experiments would be needed.

            <Title>Paradigmatic experiments: Newton</Title>
            <Text>###### The first paradigm: Newton’s *experimentum crucis*

The concept of an ‘experiment’ in science is actually relatively new. 

As you may remember from &lt;!--\fullref{pre-historyofpsychology:empiricismaboutthemind}--&gt;, we attribute the birth of the scientific method to Francis Bacon. His study of heat in the *Novum Organon* established a model of scientific reasoning: first, draw axioms from experience; and second, deduce or derive new experiences from those axioms [Bk. II, &lt;!--\S --&gt;X][#Bacon:1620ui]

1. Catalog all the instances of the thing (“Table of existence and presence”, &lt;!--\S --&gt;XI)

2. Catalog all the instances of things similar to the items listed in (1), but lacking heat (“Table of Absence”, &lt;!--\S --&gt;XI)

3. Catalog all the instances of things that do not have heat but could (“Table of degrees or comparative instances”, &lt;!--\S --&gt;XIII)

4. Finally, catalog all the instances of things that heat cannot be (“Table of exclusions”, &lt;!--\S --&gt;XVIII)

Only after these tables are made are we able to make a ‘First Harvest’, a first attempt to generalize across all these tables and interpret nature. Once this is complete, Bacon suggests we create tables of ‘privileged instances’--27 in total, that specify all instances that are solitary, revealing, concealed, etc. The 14th table is a table of ‘crucial’ or ‘critical’ instances.

&gt; We take the term from the *signposts* which are erected at forks in the road to indicate amen mark where the different roads go.  We have also chosen to call them *decisive instances* and *instances of verdicts*, and in some cases *oracular* and *commanding instances*. 

This is where the term *experimentum crucis* comes from, although for Bacon, it was a critical *instance* of observation, not a critical experiment. Robert Hooke, who we now remember for ‘Hooke’s Law’ of springs, was the first to suggest that critical instances could be manufactured in a laboratory, and hence, become *experiments*.

&lt;!--\begin{figure*}\includegraphics{../images/newton1671.png}\caption{Illustration of Newton's experiment contained in the 1st letter to the Royal Society, 1671}\label{fig:newton1671}\end{figure*}--&gt;
Newton first started his experiments on light and prisms in the early 1670’s, reporting his initial findings to the Royal Society in 1671. [#Newton:1671uw] It is actually his *second* letter on this topic, published in 1672, that is most frequently cited as the primary source. [#Newton:1672tm]. 

It is notable that Newton himself does not use the term *experimentum crucis* in his original presentations of his experiments to the Royal Society in two letters in 1671 and 1672. In 1672-1673, Hooke viciously attacked Newton’s work.  In 1673, Newton was a young man of 30, working primarily in Cambridge, not London.  Hooke was 10 years his senior, an original member of the Royal society and well ensconced in the power structures of London.

But Hooke had a theory of light, was well known to be ‘irascible’, and did not appreciate new-comers. Newton responded in 1672 [#Newton:1672wd], and again in 1673 [#Newton:1673tf]. But even in these, he does not call his experiments ‘crucial’.  He only uses that term in his *Opticks*, written 30 years later and published a year *after* Hooke’s death. [#Newton:2018th]

I mention this because, as most students familiar with Reacting will understand, the *actual* history is far more complicated than the digested version we get in most textbooks. The story Newton tells in the *Opticks* of conceiving of and performing a *crucial experiment* deduced by pure logic from the Bacon’s tables of induction is nothing more than a post-hoc myth.

But like Franklin’s kite, it is the myth, and not the actual history, that matters in understanding Newton’s influence on the development of science. So what did Newton show, and why was it ‘crucial’?

&lt;!--\newthought{The fact that white light}--&gt; that passes through a prism refracts and takes on the colors of the rainbow was well understood in 1670.  What was not understood was whether the colors of the rainbow were existent in the light and ‘revealed’ by the prism, or whether they were in the prism and ‘added’ to the white light as it passed through. In short, is the prism breaking light up, or is it acting as a colored filter?

Roughly, Hooke held the second: that light itself does not contain color, but it took on colors as it was ‘corrupted’ by the prism.  Newton, on the other hand, thought that the light’s color and the angle of refraction were one and the same, and hence, the colors were contained in the white itself, and were only revealed by refraction through the prism.

A ‘crucial’ experiment must act like a signpost. It must distinguish absolutely between the two competing theories---like a fork in the road, at a critical experiment, the two theories diverge and cannot be recombined.
&lt;!--\begin{figure*}\includegraphics{../images/newton1704.png}\caption{Illustration of Newton's experiment contained in the \emph{Opticks}, 1704. Notice that the sun is on the right, and the rays move right to left, unlike the first from 1671.}\label{fig:newton1704}\end{figure*}--&gt;

Newton and Hooke both predict that light passing through a prism will refract at a distinct angle, and will take on the colors of the rainbow.  What Newton needs is a case in which Hooke predicts one thing, and he the opposite. 

So he sets up the experiment as designed in &lt;!--\ref{fig:newton1704}--&gt;. Newton darkens the room, and opens a small pinhole in a sheet (F) covering the window. The light starts at (S), enters the room through the (F) and passes through prism (ABC). It then falls on sheet (DE), which has a hole (G).  The light coming through G is a single color. It then passes through *another* screen and prism. The resultant angle is measured.  Newton observes, at least in 1672:

&gt;“And I saw by variation of those places that the light, tending to that end of the image toward which the refraction of the first prism was made, did in the second prism suffer a refraction considerably greater than the light tending to the other end.  And so the true cause of the length of that image was detected to be no other than that light consists of rays differently refrangible, which, without any respect to a difference in their incidence were , according to their degrees of refrangibility, transmitted to divers parts of the wall.”

When light passes through the second prism, it is further refracted, but not changed in color. So how does this observation for a fork-in-the-road between his view and Hooke’s? That’s a subject of debate. But here’s my best take at his reasoning:

&lt;!--\begin{apatextbox}{Newton’s Experimentum Crucis} --&gt;
1. Either the colors and their respective angles are in the light itself, and the prism uncovers this fact, or the prism adds the colors and the angles by corrupting the pure white light.

2. If the former, then light passing through a second prism would (a) not change the color (for a color once revealed can’t be revealed again) BUT it would (b) double the angle on the second pass.

3. If the later, the light passing through a second prism would (a) change the color (for the prism adds color to whatever light it touches) AND it would (b) double the angle on the second pass.

4. Passing light through 2 prisms produces the same color as passing light through 1 prism (as well as doubles the angle).

5. Therefore, the colors and their angles are in the light itself 

&lt;!--\end{apatextbox}--&gt;

This experiment---and this reasoning---comes to be *the* standard for a good experimental design. It is the ‘paradigmatic’ experiment of its era, the ‘paradigm’ of good science.  </Text>
            <Comments>Newton himself describes the logic of his *experimentum crucis* like this:

&gt; To determine by Experiments these and such like Queries which involve the propounded theory, seems the most proper and direct way to a conclusion. And therefore I could with all objects were suspended, taken from Hypotheses or any other heads other than these two; of showing the insufficiency of Experiments to determine these Queries or prove any other parts of my theory, but assigning the flaws ad defects in my conclusions drawn from them; or of producing other Experiments which directly contradict me, if any such may seem to occur. For if the Experiments, which I urge, be defective, it cannot e difficult to show the defects. But if value, then by proving the theory they must render all Objections invalid. [p. 5005][#Newton:1672tm]
In contemporary academic English, the word ‘paradigm’ is used to mean, roughly ‘word-view’.  That usage descends from this use of the term, as the modern use can be traced back to Thomas Kuhn’s *Structure of Scienctific revolutions* ([#Kuhn:1996fi]). In it, he describes scientific progress as changing eras in which scientists look to a particular experiment as the best model of scientific reasoning, and seek to replicate that experiment in their own work. That experiment is the ‘paradigm’ for that era of scientific inquiry.  Over time, people started using the word ‘paradigm’ to refer to the era, and the people in it, rather than the experiment they valued. </Comments>

            <Title>Psychoanalysts</Title>
            <Text>#### Psychoanalysts

Psychoanalysts are split in the classical (Freudian), Jungian and unspecified.  The game contains a number of independent psychiatrists who, while they are familiar with psychoanalysis, are not professed members of the faction.

##### Classical

Classical psychoanalysis can be summarized by five basic hypotheses:

1.	First, psychoanalysts hold that the mind is composed of entities in conflict, also known as the *hypothesis of intrapsychic conflict* or **dynamic hypothesis**. In classic Freudianism, the hypothesis followed “the discovery of the unconscious” by Breuer and Freud in 1895 (see &lt;!--\ref{hysteriaandhypnosis:freudbreueronannao.}--&gt;). Traumatic event or fantasies can leave a subject with memories that are unacceptable to the conscious awareness. The conscious awareness defends itself by suppressing the traumatic event in the unconscious by means of repression (see, e.g. *Introductory Lectures on Psychoanalysis*, p. 82, 94 also p. 438). This hypothesis is sometimes called the **psychodynamic hypothesis**.

2.	Second, psychoanalysis posits that there is a finite amount of psychic energy available to any given individual. This forms the **Economic hypothesis** of classical psychoanalysis (See Freud, *Introductory Lectures*, p. 26 and 436-7 for the thesis that psychic energy is sexual; p. 340, 442-3 and 466for an explicit statement. It also appears in *On the Interpretation Dreams*, Ch7). The activities of the mind are “costly,” and hence the mind will optimize its function for the most efficient option.

3.	The **topographical hypothesis** is Freud's most well known:  the mind composed of three basic kinds of thoughts: conscious thoughts, pre-conscious thoughts and unconscious thoughts. The term 'thoughts' here is used broadly, to include wishes, desires, fears, emotions, etc. Conscious thoughts are those of which we are aware. Pre-conscious thoughts, are not currently conscious, but are readily available to consciousness. The memory of your last birthday, for example, is probably pre-conscious, not unconscious. Unconscious thoughts, which far outnumber the other two categories, are unavailable to consciousness. All these thoughts, however, originate in experience: there is nothing in the unconscious store that is not linked in some way to that individual's past experiences. (see, e.g. *Introductory lectures*, p. 25)

4.	Fourth, the **genetic hypothesis** claims that human behavior is best explained in terms of the original conditions that cause it. In Freud's theory, the genetic hypothesis takes the form of his theory of infantile sexuality.

For Freud, all behavior ultimately originates in sexual desire. To summarize briefly: Freud hypothesized that sexual drive, the main source of psychic energy, is present from birth. He is explicit in using the term 'sexual' here, but it is sometimes easier to understand if we use a softer term like 'using one's body for pleasure.' Freud repeated argues for infantile sexuality by pointing out the noncontroversial pleasure children take in tickling or cuddling, but we wouldn't necessarily call these 'sexual' today. Freud, somewhat to his determinate, insisted on the term 'sexual' even despite these kind of objections.

This drive towards physical gratification takes various forms throughout our lives, moving through the oral phase to the anal phase to the phallic stage. If the internal drives are left unfulfilled, or the internal conflicts unresolved (which is really two ways of saying the same thing), neurotic behavior results.

5.	Psychoanalysts differ with respect to the entities that comprise the mind, but most recognize Freud's basic **structural hypothesis**: the mind is functionally divided between the id, the ego and the superego (see *Introductory Lectures*, p. 365). The *id*, which is totally unconscious, contains the representations of sexual and aggressive instinctual drives. The *ego* regulates and controls the desires of the id in relation to the demands of the external world, which are internalized as the *superego*. The ego follows the **economic hypothesis**, in seeking to maximize gratification of the instinctual desires while minimizing the amount of psychic energy spent in that process. It achieves this end through the use of various mechanisms of representation and repression (sometimes called 'defense mechanisms'):

* **Repression**: The first mechanism proposed by Freud (Breuer and Freud), the ego banishes or precludes an idea or feeling from conscious awareness.
* **Isolation**: Ideas are split off from their associated feelings (affect) and presented as alien or foreign in origin.
* **Reaction formation**: replacing the unacceptable desire with its symbolic opposite.
* **Displacement**: unacceptable wishes are removed from their original objects and moved to an acceptable, or at least not-unacceptable one.
* **Projection**: an unacceptable idea or desire is attributed to someone else.
* **Undoing**: painful or unacceptable ideas are minimized by overdoing some opposite action in some opposite arena.
* **Turning against the self**:  the original object of an unpleasant desire (usually hate) is replaced with the self.
* **Denial**: the individual remains unaware of certain aspects of reality that would be painful to recognize.
* **Rationalization**: the individual convinces himself or herself that their behavior has a logical, reasonable, or at least neutral, explanation in order to avoid the unacceptable cause.
* **Identification**: usually found during development, a child becomes like another person (usually a parent) in order to deal with separation or loss of a love-object.

These conflicts can be discovered by studying the mechanisms of representation that are used to obfuscate and repress traumatic experiences and latent desires.  The mechanisms of representation take the object represented (the 'latent content') and replace it with a representation (the 'manifest content'). The relationship between these two can be one of:

* **part to whole**: the latent content is fragmented and represented in isolation. (*Introductory Lectures*, p. 147)
* **Allusion**: the latent content is represented by, in Freud's words “a caption, as it were, or an abbreviation in telegraphic style.” (*Introductory Lectures*, p. 148)
* **plastic portrayal**: the latent content is replaced with a plastic, concrete portrayal of it, taking its cue from the superficial aspects of the latent content. For example, the editor of a 'Survey' may be represented in a dream as a 'surveyor'. (*Introductory Lectures*, p.149)
* **Symbolism**: symbols are stable translations of one object into another. The relation between the object symbolized (the latent content) and the object that does the symbolization (the manifest content) is stable in an individual, but may not be stable between individuals. But it is always true that the latent content and manifest content share something in common. It is the task of the psychoanalysts, through the techniques of free association and manipulating transference reactions, to discover the common factors between the latent and manifest content, and hence reveal the symbolic relationships. (*Introductory Lectures*, p. 185)
	(see *Introductory lectures on psychoanalysis*,  Lecture VII-X)

By revealing these relationships to the subject of psychoanalysis, the ego becomes aware of latent trauma and hence can deal with it in healthy ways, removing the conflict and obviating the neurosis.

Interpsychic conflict is a part of the normal maturation of a healthy adult mind. Neurosis and Psychosis occur, therefore, when this development goes wrong in some important way. Development can go awry through *inhibition* or *regression* (see *Introductory Lectures*, Ch 22-23).  In 'inhibition', portions of function of the ego are held back from development, often because it becomes *fixated* on a particular libidnal instinct.  In 'regression' an ego that has progressed further than a given developmental stage returns to that stage was a kind of defense mechanism.

The terms 'neurosis' and 'psychoneurosis':

&gt; “refer to a class of psychiatric illnesses characterized by prominent symptoms that have no significant somatic origin. The symptoms include disturbances of feelings (anxiety, depression, guilt), disturbances of thought (obsessions), and disturbances of behavior (compulsions and phobic inhibitions), all of which are experienced as alien to the comfort and well-being of the individual” (*American Handbook of Psychiatry*, p. 737-738)

Neurosis, then, is explained when the conflict between the desires of the id and the defense mechanisms of the ego go awry: (1) the ego's defense mechanism leaves the drive unfulfilled, (2) the defense mechanism imposes a disguised or symbolic form onto the original drive in order to hide it from the consciousness, and (3) the superego imposes some suffering as punishment for the self-denial, such a guilt.

Psychosis occurs when the id constructs its own reality and imposes it on the ego. The subject can no longer function in normal life—he or she may be beset by hallucinations, persistent delusions, wild mood swings, visual and auditory agnosia, amnesia, etc. It is worth noting that unlike *neuroses*, psychoses may be the result of organic brain syndromes or other physical conditions. Psychoses not associated with physical conditions include schizophrenia, affective disorders and other reactions.

As the id is the source of psychic energy, unacceptable drives using one of the mechanisms above will not remain repressed forever. As unacceptable drives gain in strength and threaten to reveal themselves, a number of reactions are possible (see *Introductory Lectures*, Ch. 19):

* **Anxiety reaction**: a chronic, free-floating anxiety which may have periods of acute anxiety. Typified by feelings of helplessness; although symptoms include phobias, obsessions, compulsions and depression. It is caused by the failure of all the defenses to keep the unacceptable instinctual drives in stable control. (*Introductory Lectures*, Ch. 25, p. 452)
* **phobic reaction**: typified by one or more prominent phobias: and extreme anxiety focused on an ordinary place, object or situation.  The mechanism of displacement moves the anxiety associated with the unacceptable drive to a neutral place, object or situation, which then is allowed to flourish unchecked by the defense mechanisms of the ego. (*Introductory Lectures*, p. 495-498)
* **conversion reaction**: what used to be called 'hysteria', it can manifest itself in many symptoms, including spasms, temporary paralysis, visual or auditory agnosia, weakness, shortness of breath, pains, etc. It results when the unacceptable instinctual drive is 'converted' into apparently physical symptoms. (*Introductory Lectures*, p. 485, 497-8)
* **obsessive-compulsive reaction**: the patient is troubled by persistent thoughts that are usually painful in nature. These obsessional thoughts interfere in some important way with the patient's ability to engage in a meaningful adult life: i.e. intellectually, sexually, socially or professionally. Anxiety at not following through on an obsessional thought, which often manifests as repeated actions regarding some mundane object, can be severe and often is only revealed by completion of the mundane task in question. (*Introductory Lectures*, Ch. 17)

As an example, classical psychoanalysis holds that obsessive-compulsive reaction can be traced to unresolved conflicts in the anal stage of development, where frustration at potty-training is turned into rage towards one's mother. That rage, in turn, is found to be unacceptable by the ego and repressed through one of the standard mechanisms creating obsessions with objects or scenarios that are symbolically linked to the original frustration. The particular object of obsession is essentially random, as the subject latches onto some mundane object present at the time of the frustration. The choice of obsessional object, however, can provide clues as to the true cause of the frustration, as it is invariably linked, through one of the mechanisms of representation, to the true object. The compulsive aspect of this conditions is an 'acceptable' outlet for the unacceptable rage towards one's mother.  Psychoanalysts go on to hold that obsessive-compulsive is often unconsciously aware of his or her rage and may take extreme steps to avoid losing control when provoked.  

###### Psychoanalytic Treatment

Psychoanalysis—the process of psychoanalytic treatment—aims at resolving unresolved conflicts that cause neurosis. The psychoanalyst seeks to align the psychic forces within the individual so that they are no longer in conflict. A psychoanalyst must keep all five psychoanalytic hypotheses—the topographical, dynamic, economy, genetic and structural—in mind during treatment, but in practice, tends to focus on one or two at a time.  

Classical psychoanalysis makes use of two basic techniques: free association and manipulating transference reactions. In **free association**, the psychoanalyst removes himself or herself from the patients line of sight (hence the standard couch with the psychoanalyst seated behind the patients' head), and asks the patient to say whatever comes to mind when prompted regardless of logic, order or social constraint. In a relaxed state, it is theorized, these free-associations will reveal the connections between ideas that, when analyzed, explain the relationships this particular patient uses to represent latent content with manifest content.

Freud is often naively criticized for insisting on universal symbolic relationships: cigars always represent penises, for example. But this simply isn't true: classical psychoanalysis is 'empirical' in the sense that there is nothing in the mind that was not put there from experience.  The symbolic relationships found in a patient have built up by that patient, based on his or her unique experiences. Where commonalities occur between patients, they are at the level of the language (i.e. symbolic relationships that originate from homophones in German would not be found in an English-speaking patient) or culture (i.e. shared mythology). So while a cigar may represent a penis because of its shape to some, it may represent excrement because of its color to others.

**Transference** reactions are inappropriate reactions in which the patient reacts to a person or object in the present as if it were a person or object from the past (see *Introductory Lectures*, Ch. 27). Transference is, in Freud's terms, a 'repetition,' a reliving of an event, relationship, emotion, attitude, etc. with a substitute person or object. Transference can be a very powerful tool for the psychoanalyst, especially when the object that is the source of the unresolved conflict can be projected onto a substitute, and the patient allowed to address the object directly. If a patient's neurosis originates in unresolved anger towards his dead father, substituting a inanimate object for that father can allow the patient to exorcise the anger and hence dissolve the neurosis. Since Freud's masterwork *Dora*, many psychoanalysts have held transference to be the primary tool of psychoanalysis.

In order for transference to work, however, the patient must be willing and capable of suspending his or her 'ego' and regressing to the state where he or she really believes that the substitute is the original source of the conflict. As psychotics live in a state where experienced reality is formed by the psychic desire not reality itself; psychotics are not suitable candidates for treatment via transference.

Throughout treatment, the psychoanalysts must be aware of **resistance**.  Resistance is the patient's opposition to treatment. It defends the status quo by maintaining the neurosis or psychosis. Resistance may be conscious, subconscious or pre-conscious. It may hinder or misdirect free association. It may distract via inappropriate and unhelpful transference reactions. It may adapt to novel situations and invent new strategies. As Freud himself said “The resistance accompanies the treatment step by step. Every single association, every act of the person under treatment must reckon with the resistance and represents a compromise between the forces that are striving towards recovery and the opposing ones.” (1912, p. 11).

The psychoanalytic treatment can then be broken down into four basic steps:

* **Confrontation**: The first step in psychoanalysis: the patient's conscious ego must be made aware that there is a problem.  

* **Clarification**: The problem is put into sharp focus. Often, this process works with the previous, as minor conflicts give way to greater conflicts.

* **Interpretation**: The process of bringing the unconscious conflict into consciousness.

* **Working through**: the progressive elaboration of resistance mechanisms as they manifest.

There are, of course, many more complications that occur in any single patient's psychoanalytic treatment, but these four basic steps are almost universally recognized.

When embarking on a new treatment, then, the psychoanalyst has three basic aims:

1. To translate the productions of the patient into their unconscious antecedents. The patient's thoughts, fantasies, feelings, behavior, and impulses have to be traced to their unconscious predecessors.

2. The unconscious elements must be synthesized into meaningful insights. Fragments of past and present history, conscious and unconscious, must be connected so as to give a sense of continuity and coherence in terms of the patient's life.

3. The insight so obtained must be communicable to the patient. As one listens one must ascertain what uncovered material will be constructively utilizable by the patient. (quoting from the \emph{American Handbook of Psychiatry}, p. 779)


###### Jung

Jungian psychoanalysis is distinguished from classical psychoanalysis by two major shifts in the basic theory.

First, Jungian psychoanalysis holds that the subconscious contains psychical elements that do not originate in the experiences of the individual being psychoanalyzed.  As mentioned previously, classical psychoanalysis is empirical about the mind (for an explanation of that tradition, see &lt;!--\ref{pre-historyofpsychology:empiricismaboutthemind}--&gt;), holding that the mind comes into the world as a blank slate (tabla rasa), and is progressively filled by experiences. The contents of the unconscious must therefore be traceable to discrete experiences in the individual's life. And it is the task of psychoanalysis to discover those experiences.  

Jungian psychoanalysts believe they have evidence of unconscious contents that are not explainable by the experiences of the individual. Thus, they hypothesize the existence of a deeper 'collective unconscious' that is composed of 'archetypes' that inform and structure the content of both the unconscious as well as our conscious lives.

Second, on a related note, Jungian psychoanalysis extends the *genetic hypothesis* from Freud's insistence that all psychic energy was sexual energy to include sexual energy as just one of many sources of psychic energy.

For example, Freud originally posited that neurosis originated in traumatic experience in childhood on the basis of self-reports of his case-study patients. He ultimately came to realize, however, that these self-reports were fictionalizations, theorizing that the  true cause of his patient's neurosis lay in their infantile fixations. Once again, Jung extends Freud's insight to allow for fixations throughout life. He argues that:

&gt;	..the moment of the outbreak of neurosis is not just a matter of chance; as a rule it is most critical. It is usually *the moment when a new psychological adjustment, that is, a new adaptation, is demanded*. Such moments facilitate the outbreak of a neurosis, as every experienced neurologist knows.

 &gt; This fact seems to me extremely significant. If the fixation were indeed real we should expect to find its influence constant: in other words, a neurosis lasting throughout life. This is obviously not the case. The psychological determination of a neurosis is only partly due to an early infantile predisposition; it must be due to some cause in the present as well. (*The Essential Jung*, 49 “Psychoanalysis and Neurosis”)

That leads to the general proposition that Freud's identification of sexual desire as *the* origin of neurosis was far too narrow. Sexual desire is one of the pleasurable instincts that shape our psychology, but for Jung, “psychoanalytic theory should be freed from the purely sexual standpoint. In place of it I should like to introduce an *energetic viewpoint* into the psychology of neurosis” (ibid, p. 50).

Jung hypothesizes that the libidinal energies naturally increased when faced with an obstacle, in order to overcome it through adaptation. When that obstacle is too great, the libido retreats and regresses, and the patient reverts to a more primitive “mode of adaptation.” The practice of psychoanalysis is the same, however, as Jung theorizes that the energy that the patient needs to overcome the present obstacle and become healthy is attached to these sexual fixations. By bringing past frustrations and maladaptations to light through psychoanalysis, the libidinal energy is free to return to the present-day task: adaptation to overcome the current obstacle.

The task of a psychoanalyst, then, is not only to discover the original traumatic cause of a neurosis, probably buried deep in childhood, but to discover the current obstacle that is perceived as being insurmountable. Jung agrees with Freud that the childhood fixations determine the *form* of neurosis, but unlike Freud holds that they cannot be considered the *immediate cause* of neurosis.

The difference between practice among the psychoanalytic approaches is emphasis, not technique. As J.B. Wheelwright noted in 1963, “Freud focused on sexuality, Adler focused on power, and Jung focused on growth, which he called individuation.” (quoted in *American Handbook of Psychiatry*, p. 817)

            <Comments>'Neurotic' behavior results from continuing conflict between the libinal desires and the ego's repression techniques. 'Psychotic' behaviors result when the libinal desires assert their reality on the ego. See the discussion of 'neurosis' and 'psychosis' in the History of the Classification of Mental Illness section below.
The Introductory Lectures were published before Freud solidified the structural hypothesis using this terminology.  The beginnings of the idea, however, is present in the later chapters on neurosis: see, e.g. p. 437-438, where he describes the conflict between the 'libido' and the 'ego'.
The Introductory Lectures mention only repression, subdivided into 'condensation' and 'displacement' as mechanisms of the ego, but promises further work on the topic (p. 364-366). He began to develop a taxonomy of ego mechanisms later in his life, but the full-fledged taxonomy we see here was developed his daughter Anna Freud (1936). The Ego and and the Mechanisms of Defense. C. Baines (trans). Connecticut: International University Press.
In many works, including Psychopathology in Everyday Life, Introductory Lectures on Psychoanalysis and On the Interpretation of Dream, Freud provides the following outline of the kinds of commonality that underly symbolism: that of number (i.e. '3' and male genitalia), shape (i.e. long, straight objects such as sticks, umbrellas, posts, trees represent the male organ / hollowness or enclosing space such as vessels, bottles, boxes, trunks and ships symbolize female genitals; apples, peaches and fruit symbolize breasts), function (i.e. penetrating the body: knives, daggers, spears, sabers, firearms, rifles, pistols etc.; producing liquids, such as water-taps, water-cans, etc.; and being capable of lengthening or shortening, such as pencils, hanging-lamps, etc.; defying gravity (i.e. balloons, flying machines and zeppelins also represent the male organ). More complicated representations depend on personal associations with or reactions to objects: the complicated nature of landscapes mean they represent female bodies, sweets represent sexual satisfaction. Activities such as playing games, playing piano, sliding, gliding or pulling stand for masturbation because of the similarity of action. On the same note, rhythmic actions such as dancing, riding and climbing stand in for the sex act itself. Simple associations may appear as well: neckties, which are only worn by men, can symbolize men. (Introductory Lectures, p. 188-204)

see 295-299 of the DSM II
See item 300 in the DSM II for the full taxonomy of neurosis.
There is something of a controversy over whether psychoanalysis can be used to treat psychosis. While many psychoanalysts believe psychosis and neurosis to be on a single spectrum of mental dysfunction, the psychotic patient's connection to reality is so tenuous that the techniques of free-association and transference threaten to develop the psychosis further, rather than dissolve it.
In Aristotlean metaphysics, the *formal* cause of something is the form of the thing whereas the immediate cause are the events that immediately proceeded the thing in question.  The *form* is the pattern or type of thing something is. The immediate cause is what brings that thing into being. In this context, the *form* distinguishes the type of neurosis, the immediate cause is what caused the neurosis to present at this moment.</Comments>

            <Text>###### The paradigm in experimental psychology: Hermann Ebbinghaus

As you may recall from  &lt;!--\ref{birthofpsychology:germanphysiologicalpsychologyinthe1880s-1890s.}--&gt;, in the 1860s and 1870s a handful of researchers in German started applying the experimental method to sensation and perception. Fechner’s law was one of the first great successes of this era, as for the first time, it related a physical phenomenon to a psychological one with the precision of mathematics. 

Today, Ebbinghaus is frequently characterized as the ‘founder’ of experimental psychology---as he site ‘encyclopedia.com’ does---and his experiments frequently taught in intro to research methods courses.  This makes his work a ‘paradigm’ for contemporary psychology. In order to understand what counts as ‘good science’ in this environment, we must understand Ebbinghaus.

The first step in scientific endeavor into a new domain, according to Ebbinghaus, is to 

&gt; The method of obtaining exact measurements i.e., numerically exact ones of the inner structure of causal relations is, by virtue of its nature, of general validity. This method, indeed, has been so exclusively used and so fully worked out by the natural sciences that, as a rule, it is defined as something peculiar to them, as the method of natural science. [p. 7][#Ebbinghaus:1885ud]

&lt;!--\begin{marginfigure}

\label{fig: ebbinghaus-clip}
\end{marginfigure}
--&gt;
Following Fechner, the primary goal of scientific investigation---prehaps *the* defining feature of science itself---is the creation of mathematically precise descriptions of natural phenomena. 

When Ebbinghaus first approached the question of memory, he needed to create an environment, like Newton’s darkened room, where comparisons between different tasks could be compared. 

The first step is to control “the mass of conditions which have proven themselves causally connected with a certain result”, then, one of those is systematically varied, and the resulting effect measured.

&lt;!--\newthought{Ebbinghaus set out to systematically measure memory}--&gt;---so he created a protocol for testing his own memory. In order to control his own personal associations with words, which might make them more memorable, he created a list of 2,300 1-syllable nonsense words. These were drawn randomly for each experiment. He then memorized lists and he measured how many he could remember after a given time period---he didn’t do this by introspection, but forced himself to actually write down all that he could recall, and check to see how accurate he was. He formalized the process of memorization, going so far as to use a clockwork mechanism to ensure that he spent the exact same amount of time memorizing each list.

There were things he could not control, of course. He recognized that his own accent and ‘mother-tongue’ might influence the test, the ‘conditions of his daily life’ might have an impact---he recognizes that his mind is typically fresher in the morning than the evening, for example. The experiments took months to complete, and there could be seasonal effects.  

He then varied the length of the lists and compared it against the time it takes to memorize. And he did this repeatedly, recording 518 lists over two periods, 1789-1790 and 1883-1884.
&lt;!--\begin{figure*}\includegraphics{../images/ebbinghaus1885.png}\caption{Ebbinghaus’ first table of results in his \emph{Memory}, 1885}\label{fig:ebbinghaus1}\end{figure*}--&gt;

He also counted, using a string of beads, the number of repetitions it took to memorize a list. This produced, after many variations and trials, the chart to the right, not called ‘The learning curve’.
&lt;!--\begin{marginfigure}
 \begin{center}

     \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{../images/ebbinghausFig6.png}
\end{center}
 \caption{Screenshot of “Fig 6” from p. 48, Ebbinghaus 1885. Now called ‘the learning curve.’}
\label{fig: ebbinghaus6}
\end{marginfigure}
--&gt;

&lt;!--\newthought{Ebbinghaus then turned his attention to recall and retention.}--&gt; Working from the commonsense notion that the longer you study, the longer it is retained, Ebbinghaus designed a protocol whereby he would measure the number of repetitions it would aka not re-learn a list after a given amount of time.  Perfect recall would ’cost’ no further repetitions or time.  Total failure would (presumably) require the same amount of time as it took in the first place.

As before, this protocol is designed to create a numeric representation (number of repetitions)  of a psychological idea (ability to recall). As one might expect, the higher the number of repetitions on learning, the fewer needed after 24 hours to recall the list perfectly.

Measuring in seconds, Ebbinghaus determined the amount of time ‘saved’ when re-learning by repeating the learning in the first place---and the average number of seconds saved by each additional repetition. His results are remarkable:
&lt;!--\begin{marginfigure}
 \begin{center}

     \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{../images/ebbinghaus2.png}
\end{center}
 \caption{Screenshot recall table, p. 56 Ebbinghaus 1885.}
\label{fig: ebbinghaus2}
\end{marginfigure}
--&gt;

&lt;!--\newthought{His last great contribution to psychology is the ‘forgetting curve’.}--&gt;  Using the measurements developed in previous experiments, Ebbinghaus started measuring the number of repetitions needed to restore a list versus the amount of time since the list was memorized. He found that after just and hour, 1/2 of the original work was required to refresh the list.  But after 8 hours, it was only 2/3rds, not the whole amount. He also discovered that individual items in the list are retained differently according to their serial position.  He summarized his findings as:

&gt; The strength of the connection, and therefore the amount of work which is eventually saved, is a decreasing function of the time or of the number of intervening members which separated the syllables in question from one another in the original series. It is a maximum for immediately successive members.  The precise character of the function is unknown except that it decreases at first quickly and then gradually very slowly with the increasing distance  of the terms. [p. 107][#Ebbinghaus:1885ud]

While the list of psychological principles attributed to Ebbinghaus is long, it is absolutely true that he noted what is now called the “magic number 7”--that the longest list of random syllables one can remember without practice is 7. [p. 47][#Ebbinghaus:1885ud]
	
It’s also true that all of these experiments were preformed on an experimental group of one individual: himself.  There was no control group and no random sampling of a population. But it is also noteworthy that he recognized these limitations in his study: 

&gt; The tests were all made upon myself and have primarily only individual significance. Naturally they will not reflect exclusively mere idiosyncrasies of my mental organisation; if the absolute values found are throughout only individual, yet many a relation of general validity will be found in the relation of these numbers to each other or in the relations of the relations. [Author’s preface, p. v][#Ebbinghaus:1885ud]

Ebbinghaus’ paradigm is not having a control group, blinding reviewers, or randomizing across a population. Rather, I suspect, Ebbinghaus’ paradigm comes down to two things:

1. Ebbinghaus’ goal throughout these studies was to describe psychological phenomena in the precise language of mathematics. While *Memory* does contain a few formulae, the whole of the book is consumed with the validity of his measurements of the time it takes to memorize and the costs of forgetting.

2. Ebbinghaus set a standard for transparency of data and thoroughness in controlling potential confounding variables. He addresses every potential confound as it arrises and redesigns his protocol to control, or measure that confound. And those he cannot, he labels and presents to the reader.  The passage quoted above demonstrates his laudable self-reflection, precisely specifying the weakness in his experiment that he could not control.
 
Indeed, in reading *Memory*, one cannot help but be impressed by Ebbinghaus’ thoroughness and dedication to the transparency of his research. The book is only 117 pages of text, yet it covers 5 years of experimentation and thousands of trials. This, I suspect, is the true paradigm of Ebbinghaus: that psychological measurement must be carried out extraordinarily carefully, with all due attention to potential confounds.</Text>

            <Title>Behaviorists</Title>
            <Text>#### Behaviorists

Behaviorism holds that psychology is properly limited to the observation, prediction and control of behavior. It  typified by four hypotheses:

1. *Internal entities are neither the object of scientific study nor explanatorily relevant to psychology.* Behaviorism begins with the deceptively simply insight that while psychoanalytic explanations are framed in terms of psychic entities (ego, id, etc.), quantities (psychic energy) and interactions (the mechanisms of repression), what all psychological theories seek to explain is behavior. These psychic entities, and the massive vocabulary that is required to discuss them, are all hypothetical, posited for the sake of explaining why people behave the way they do. Moreover, psychoanalytic hypotheses require a sharp dividing line between human behavior and animal behavior, which is not born out by empirical observation.
To be scientific, then, psychology must limit itself to observable behavior. The discourse of psychology as a scientific discipline is restricted to those terms that denote observable variables: behavior and environmental conditions, not internal mental states. From characterizing the phenomenon to be studied to offering an explanation, the behaviorist is committed to avoiding all terms that denote entities, quantities or interactions that are internal or unobservable.
A corollary of the thesis, which is frequently highlighted as an independent claim, is that *introspection is not a scientific form of observation*. One might argue (as historical figures like William James and William Wundt did–see &lt;!--\ref{americanpsychology:williamjamesandthefunctionofconsciousness} and \ref{introspection:wundt}--&gt;) that internal states *are* scientifically observable via introspection.  Behaviorists, however, reject introspection as scientifically unreliable. Evidence from Wundt and James demonstrates, they argue, that introspective procedures produce different results for different practitioners, and scientific evidence should be replicable regardless of the practitioner.
Behaviorists disagree on whether internal mental states are non-existent fictions or merely unavailable to scientific inquiry; but that is not important here. What is important is that these putative internal mental states do not enter into the scientific study of behavior, or the scientific language that describes and explains behavior.

2.	*The proper object of study for psychology is the organism and its environment*. As a corollary of this insight, Behaviorists see behavior as the activity of an *organism*, not the activity of a *mind*. Psychology, for the behaviorist, is not the study of *parts* of an organism (such as the “ego,” “id,” and “superego”) and their relations, but rather the organism *as a whole* and its relationships with its environments.  And similarly, explanations offered by Behaviorists refer to organisms, behaviors and environmental conditions, not methods of repression and techniques of representation. Behaviorism restricts is object of study as well as its explanations to the macroscopic scale: things that can be directly observed by the naked eye. In the classical sense, Behaviorism rejects *as non-scientific* explanations in terms of or investigations into things that are larger (societies, cultures) or smaller (brains, neurons).
This thesis unites behaviorism with classical psychoanalysis in opposition to Jung, because it holds that all present behavior is the result of discrete learning events in the individual's past.   But unlike psychoanalytic explanations that posit unresolved psychic conflict to explain behavior, the behaviorist appeals only to previous learning experiences. To discover the reason for a given behavior then, is to discover the patterns of environmental reinforcement (called 'conditioning') that have caused the organism to learn this behavior. To cure a behavior is to 'extinguish' those conditioned responses in the organism or block those responses by substituting a new and novel response. Behaviorists hypothesize that learning can be physically realized in neurology, and hence, behaviorism is far more simple and plausible a theory than psychoanalysis, which cannot.

3.	*The principles of learning are generalizable across species.* Behaviorists argue that given that animals are incapable of introspection—or, if they are, they cannot communicate it—psychological theories that make use of introspection are incapable of explaining animal psychology.  Behaviorism, however, is not. Non-human animals are organisms living in environments that behave in certain regular ways. All of that is accessible to behavioristic science. And as it is an uncontroversial observation that at least some human behavior is the same as animal behavior (caring for the young, for example), it follows that behaviorism can explain regularities that introspective psychology cannot.

##### Learning

A behavioristic explanation of a given behavior takes the form of specifying the mechanism of learning that caused this behavior.  A behavioristic treatment seeks to 'extinguish' that behavior through providing an antithetical mechanism.

Learning mechanisms in behaviorism are built on the principles of reinforcement and extinction. Explanation of reinforcement and extinction are always specified in terms of stimulus and response. According to Watson, by 'stimulus' behaviorists “mean any object in the general environment or any change in the physiological condition of the animal, such as the change we get when we keep an animal from sex activity, when we keep it from feeding, when we keep it from building a nest.”  By 'response' behaviorists “mean that system of organized activity that we see emphasized anywhere in any kind of animal, as building a skyscraper, drawing plans, having babies, writing books, and the like.” (1929)

In recent years, B.F. Skinner has popularize operant conditioning and the idea of 'reinforcing' a behavior. Anything that increases the likelihood of a response given a stimulus is a *reinforcement*.  Positive reinforcement takes the form of adding some “rewarding” object to the environment when the desired response occurs.  “Negative” reinforcement usually means the removal of such objects.  Reinforcing objects need not be physical, tangible objects, but can something as intangible as the attention of a parent. “Punishment” is a negative condition applied to the organism following a behavior.

A decrease in the probability of a response given a stimulus over time is called *extinction*. In classical conditioning models of learning, the lack of repetitive exposure to reinforcement will result in progressive extinction of the conditioned response.

The mechanisms learning are:

* **Classical conditioning**, which is sometimes called 'past reinforcement,' occurs when an unconditioned stimulus, such as the presentation of food, causes an unconditioned ('natural') response, such as salivation. These 'natural' stimulus-response patterns are called “embryologic responses,” and they are raw material of a classical conditioning paradigm. In classical conditioning, the conditioning intervention in the embryological response occurs by pairing a 'conditioned stimulus' (such as the ringing of a bell) with the unconditioned stimulus. After repeated exposures, the original unconditioned response can be removed, and the response (now 'conditioned') will occur when the subject is presented with the conditioned stimulus. These basic pairings between conditioned stimuli and responses can be generalized over time, so that any loud noise, for example, may cause salivation.  

* **Operant conditioning** differs from classical conditioning insofar as the conditioning intervention occurs after the response, rather than concurrent with the unconditioned stimulus. Operant condition introduces the possibility of promised reinforcement, which would occur when the promise of future reinforcement causes behavior.

###### Behaviorism as a treatment in psychiatry

Behavioral treatments in psychiatry, like behaviorism in psychology, follows from a deceptively simple insight: that psychiatric treatment aims at the cessation of maladaptive behavior.  Like psychoanalysis, behavioral therapies restrict themselves to neurosis, not psychosis.

There are two major kinds of inhibition therapies found in the literature:

* **Reciprocal inhibition**, developed by Wolpe, involves diminishing the maladaptive behavior by conditioning a new behavior in response to a given stimulus that is incompatible with the undesired behavior. For reciprocal inhibition to work, the maladaptive behavior *must be* incompatible with the new conditioned behavior. Aversion therapy, which exposes the subject to the object of desire and conditions a new negative response, is a form of reciprocal inhibition.
* **Transmarginal inhibition**, also known as *flooding*, involves exposing the patient to strong examples of the stimuli for prolonged periods.

Other inhibition therapies, such as 'retroactive inhibition' are usually forms of reciprocal inhibition.

            <Comments>As with most things in the history of ideas, even this definition is controversial.  I've chosen this definition, which reflects Skinner's presentation of Behaviorism in his 1953 Science and Human Behavior, chapter 1 because it is the most explicit and radical.  Watson defines that the goal of behaviorism as the “prediction and control of behavior,” (1913) leaving out observation. To understand the various different forms of behaviorism that have been posited since Watson's, please see &lt;!--\ref{psychoanalysts}--&gt; on page &lt;!--\pageref{psychoanalysts}--&gt;.
See, for further explication of this claim, Skinner 1953, p. 27-31. Watson does not use the term 'inner state', but refers rather to 'consciousness', which he (possibly fallaciously) equates with the object of introspection. Thus, after objecting to the unreliability of introspective reports in a laboratory setting he claims “The time seems to have come when psychology must discard all references to consciousness; when it need no longer delude itself into thinking that it is making mental states the object of observation.”
Animals do not have superegos or techniques of repression, so the behaviors explained in psychoanalytic terms should not generalize across species. But they do. Therefore, psychoanalytic explanations are insufficient.
Watson seeks to eliminate the following misleading and unscientific terms from psychology: “consciousness, mental states, mind, content, introspectively verifiable, imagery, and the like.” (1913)
See, e.g. Watson 1913 “Introspection forms no essential part of its methods, nor is the scientific value of its data dependent upon the readiness with which they lend themselves to interpretation in terms of consciousness” and Skinner 1953 p. 30
Recall that Behaviorism was formed in the first half of the 20th century, when Hegelianism was a viable theory of social science. Behaviorists here are not rejecting the plausibility of modern social psychology, anthropology or sociology. They are rejecting the idea of a transcendent spirit that instantiates human culture.
See, e.g. Watson 1913 “The behaviorist, in his efforts to get a unitary scheme of animal response, recognizes no dividing line between man and brute.”

### Brief history of the concept of 'Psychology'

Psychology is probably the youngest of commonly accepted academic disciplines---the first PhD in Psychology was earned by G. Stanley Hall in 1878. But we'll get to that. First, we have to go back to the notion of science itself.

#### Pre-history of Psychology: Empiricism about the Mind

The scientific investigation into the human mind and/or human behavior begins almost simultaneously with science itself.  Our inquiry into its history must then begin with the followers of Francis Bacon, who created the ‘scientific method’ and trace the idea that the can be studied scientifically through the rise of the empiricists into the present day. All citations for Bacon are to [#Bacon:1620ui].

Bacon, who we now credit with establishing 'The Scientific Method,' argued that the human mind tended to distort reality in regular, systematic ways, which he called 'idols.' In order to understand reality, we must then give up on the idea that a single person can discover the truth on his or her own.

 In order to learn about the world, we need to work together, collaboratively creating a “natural and experimental history” (Bk 2, Ch X, p 109) of the phenomenon.  As working collaboratively can lead to confusion and misunderstanding, we organize that natural and experimental history into a series of tables: including instances of the phenomenon's presence, closely related instances in which the phenomenon is absent, instances in which the phenomenon occurs in degrees or in comparison, and instances of exclusion of the phenomenon. Once these tables are built, we review them and create what Bacon called a 'first harvest' of the phenomenon. In short, this is a generalized axiom unifying the phenomenon yet held close to observation. Once that first axiom is established, we return to the tables, highlighting privileged instances which are further classified as solitary, transitory, revealing, etc. These, then can be used to further refine the first harvest into further, more careful axioms.

Bacon profoundly influenced Elizabethan England. His empirical method sparked inquiry in almost all areas of human knowledge, and formed the basis for what we now call the 'scientific revolution' or the 'enlightenment.' And his influence on psychology and psychiatry is actually far more direct than most would assume.  Late in his life, Bacon became friends with the Philosopher Thomas Hobbes. In fact, Hobbes founded a Baconian reading group in Oxford, which is the forbearer of the Royal Society—the world's oldest scientific body.

Thomas Hobbes, who is most widely known for his initiation of social-contract theory in defense of absolute monarchy, opens his master work Leviathan with this bold claim:

&gt; Nature (the art whereby God hath made and governs the world) is by the *art* of man, as in many other things, so in this also imitated, that it can make an artificial animal.  For seeing life is but a motion of limbs, the beginning whereof is in some principal part within, why may we not say that all *automata* (engines that move themselves by springs and wheels as doth a watch) have an artificial life? For what is the *heart*, but a *spring*; and the *nerves*, but so many *strings*; and the *joints*, but so many *wheels*, giving motion to the whole body such was was intended by the artificer? [Ch 1, &lt;!--\S --&gt;1][#Hobbes:1651wh]

Just as his famous social-political philosophy posited universal laws of human conduct, Hobbes believed that the human mind followed to universal laws which were deducible through reason. Always a Baconian, Hobbes begins by separating those who have minds (humans) from those who do not (non-human animals), and then query the difference between those two.

According to Hobbes, humans surpass animals in this faculty: “that when he conceived anything whatsoever, he was apt to inquire the consequences of it, and what effects he could do with it.”  In addition, humans can “can by words reduce the consequences he finds to general rules, called theorems, or aphorisms; that is, he can reason, or reckon, not only in number, but in all other things whereof one may be added unto or subtracted from another.” [Ch V, &lt;!--\S --&gt;6][#Hobbes:1651wh].  

Thus we have the beginning of psychology: human minds work by the process of deducing consequences and abstracting from particular experiences to general rules through basic logical functions. 

Let’s take a moment to contrast this with an alternative approach.  René Descartes, who many consider to be the founder of modern western Philosophy, argued that the mind was wholly distinct from the body, and therefore subject to an entirely different set of laws.  His most famous argument for mind-body dualism asks us to doubt all that cannot be known with certainty, and then concludes that one cannot doubt that one is doubting; hence thinking; hence one cannot doubt that one is a thinking thing.  This famous argument (called the “cogito”) is contained the First Meditation. But Descartes offers a much more interesting and influential argument in a number of other writings. The argument appears twice in *The Discourse on Methods*, first in part 3:

&gt;...if there were such machines having the organs and the shape of a monkey or of some other animal that lacked reason, we would have no way of recognizing that they were not entirely of the same nature as these animals; where as, if there were any such machines that bore a resemblance to our bodies and imitated our actions as far as this is practically feasible, we would always have two very certain means of recognizing that they were not at all, for that reason, true men.  The first is that they could never use words or other signs, or put them together as we do in order to declare our thoughts to others.  For one can well conceive of a machine being so made that it utters words, and even that it utters words appropriate to the bodily actions that will cause some change in its organs... But it could not arrange its words differently so as to respond to the sense of all that will be said in its presence, as even the dullest men can do. [Ch 3, 1637][#Descartes:1968uf]

And then again in part 5:

&gt;[in looking at the body] I found there precisely all those things that can be in us without our thinking about them, and hence, without our soul's contributing to them, that is to say, that part distinct from the body of which it has been said previously that its nature is only to think.  And these are all the same features in which one can say that animals lacking reason resemble us.  But I could not on that account find there any of those functions, which, being dependent on thought, are the only ones that belong to us as men, although I did find them all later on, once I had supposed God created a rational soul and joined it to this body in particular manner that I described. [Ch 5, 1637][#Descartes:1968uf]

The same point appears in his *Letter to Henry More*:

&gt;Nevertheless it has never been observed that any brute beast arrived at such perfection that it could use true speech, that is, that it indicated by words or signs something that can be ascribed to thought alone, and not to a natural impulse.  For speech is the only certain sign of thought concealed in the body, and all men, even the stupidest and most insane, make use of it, but not any brute.  Therefore, this can be taken to be the true differentia between man and brutes [p. 297][#Descartes:ut]

In these passages, Descartes ascribes to humans alone the ability to use language and conceive of abstract ideas. He then finds that these abilities cannot be the products of material, finite reality. As experience is limited to finite reality, ideas of things that are not finite must be 'ascribed to thought alone.' Thus, these ideas must be innate to the mind and not based on experience. It  follows that that these distinctly human abilities are the products of a non-material infinite reality. In short, the argument is this:

1. Humans alone use language and conceive of abstract entities (i.e. 'infinity').

2. No material mechanism could ever use language or conceive of an abstract entity.

3. Therefore, humans cannot just be not material mechanism

Hobbes' asserted earlier that human beings could be imitated through material mechanisms, and that our minds are ruled by the law of inquiring of the consequences of an action.  This runs directly counter to Descartes' argument, as Hobbes believes abstract entities are merely the result of inquiring consequences. But insofar Hobbes has only made an assertion—a hypothesis—it needs empirical demonstration. To establish Hobbes' contention and meet Descartes' challenge scientifically, Hobbes must show a physical machine could, through experience, develop both the ability to speak rationally and conceive of abstract entities that are not clearly the product of experience (such as 'infinity').

It is easy to see how the process of 'addition and subtraction' could produce a concept of infinity. But it is hard to see how simple arithmetic could produce a machine that could “arrange its words differently so as to respond to the sense of all that will be said in its presence, as even the dullest men can do.”

John Locke follows Hobbes in this, just as he does in the development of political liberalism.  Locke’s famous *Essay on Human Understanding* opens with a fifty-eight page argument against the idea of innate ideas. Locke picks up the project where Hobbes left off, adding 'reflection' (what we now call 'introspection') as an additional source of ideas. For Locke, like for Hobbes , the mind is populated with ideas that originate in experience. We come to understand our minds, and how our minds occasionally lead us astray, by understanding the mental mechanisms that produce ideas from sensation. Abstract ideas like 'infinity' are the products of a process of abstraction:

&gt; Finite then, and infinite, being by the mind looked on as modifications of expansion and duration, the next thing to be considered, is, -How the mind comes by them.  As for the idea of the finite, there is no great difficulty...Every one that has an idea of any stated lengths of space, as a foot, finds that he can repeat that idea; and joining it to the former, make the idea of two feet; and by the addition of a third, three feet; and so on, without every coming to an end of his additions, whether of the same idea of a foot, or, if he pleases, of doubling it, or any idea he has of any length, as a mile, or diameter of the earth, or of the orbis magnus...This, I think, is the way whereby the mind gets the idea of infinite space. --[Book 2, Ch17] [#Locke:1959wj]

But like Hobbes, Locke fails to explain how language structure could be produced by a finite mechanism.

At the same time Locke was writing in England, Antione Arnaud, a fervent supporter of Descartes' theory of mind, was developing a school of thought in France which we now call the 'Port-Royalist' movement. ([#Carr:1996uw]) The Port-Royalists held that the structure of grammar was universal for humans and could be reduced to the laws of logic. Unlike the empiricists Hobbes and Locke, however, the Port-Royalists, who including the great logician and mathematician Pascal, were dualists and theists. ([#Clark1903]) For the Port-Royalists, thought was different from language, although we tend to think in language through force of habit.  Pure thought, both in its content and its structure, becomes imperfect when 'translated' into an imperfect spoken language. A perfect language, and perfect grammar, would be possible if each word signified unequivocally a single simple idea, and the grammar of speech matched perfectly the 'grammar of thought.' 

The empiricists Hobbes and Locke have adequately responded to Descartes’ assertion that ideas about abstract objects could not have their origin in the physical, finite, world.  But neither of them have managed to respond meaningfully to the assertion that the ability to put ideas together *in language* cannot be the product of the physical, finite world.

David Hume, the great Scottish Empiricist is really the first to answer this challenge.  He took Locke’s argument against innate ideas and married it to the idea of a universal structure of the mind. First, he extending the argument against innateness beyond the concept of the infinite:

&gt; The idea of God, as meaning an infinitely intelligent, wise, and good Being, arises from reflecting on the operations of our own mind, and augmenting, without limit, those qualities of goodness and wisdom. [&lt;!--\S --&gt;2, p. 14][#Hume:IGMvPNU2]

And second, he advanced the thesis that principles of connection between ideas in the mind were regular and hence subject to empirical investigation. In fact, he posited three:  RESEMBLANCE, CONTIGUITY in time or place and CAUSE and EFFECT. [Part 1, &lt;!--\S --&gt; IV][#Hume:IGMvPNU2]

This thesis he believed explained the universality of human language structures:

&gt; It is evident that there is a principle of connexion between the different thoughts or ideas of the mind, and that, in the appearance to the memory or imagination, they introduce each other with a certain degree of method or regularity... ...Amoung different languages, even where we cannot suspect the least connexion or communication, it is found, that the words, expressive of ideas, the most compounded, do yet nearly correspond to each other: a certain proof that the simple ideas, comprehended in the compound ones, were bound together by some universal principle, which had an equal influence on all mankind.

Thus, with Hume, we can find the origin of the empirical study of the mind, although 'psychology' was not distinguished from 'natural philosophy' for at least another century.

It is important to point out here that for these thinkers, the objects of study are *ideas*.  The central claims are that there are regular, law-like relationships between ideas themselves, whether they be causal or grammatical. That central claim unites them with early psychology.  But as we will see, is the challenged in the Behaviorist revolution in the US in the early 1930’s and 1940’s.

#### Birth of Psychology: German Physiological Psychology in the 1880s-1890s.

In about 1847, four friends, three of them students of Johannes Müller (1801-1858), gathered together in Berlin to swear an oath dedicating themselves to undermining vitalism: the theory that all living entities shared a special irreducible ‘vital force.’  They committed themselves to the view that:

&gt;No other forces than the common physical-chemical ones are active within the organism. In those cases which cannot at the time be explained by these forces one has either to find the specific way or form of their action by means of the physical –mathematical method or assume new forces equal in dignity to the chemical-physical forces inherent in matter, reducible to the force of attraction and repulsion. (Quoted in [#Bernfeld:1949ji])


These four friends were Hermann von Helmholtz (1821-1894), Carl Ludwig (1816-1895), Emil du Bois-Reymond (1818-1896) and Ernst Wilhelm von Brücke (1819-1892). They were joined shortly thereafter by Hermann Lotze (1817-1891) and his student Gustav Fechner (1801-1887) and came to dominate the training of the next generation of psychologist and psychiatrists: Helmholtz hired Christine Ladd-Franklin as his assistant, who went on to be one of the first woman members of the APA, and the first woman to hold a professorship at the University of Chicago. Sigmund Freud studied under Brücke; Ivan Pavlov under Ludwig and Wilhem Wundt under du Bois-Reymond. Wundt went on to work in Helmholtz’s lab after Ladd-Franklin returned to America.

While all four of these thinkers had a profound influence on the founding and development of psychology as a discipline, we’ll focus attention for the moment on Helmholtz.  

Helmholtz was one of the great scientific minds of his era. Not only is he now recognized as a godfather of experimental psychology, he is widely respected in the history or Optics, and is, in many ways, the father of ophthalmology, having invented the ophthalmoscope.

His professor, Müller, held that nerves had 'specific sense energies' naturally: our sensory system had certain *a priori* assumptions about time and space literally built into them, making sensory experience like binocular vision possible. Students familiar with the history of philosophy may recognize this as a position influenced by Kantian psychology.

Helmholtz, however, posited that our mental system as a whole adjusted itself through a process of 'unconscious inference' to represent the external world. The contents of our experiences---the redness of a red apple, for example---are merely 'signs' or 'indicators' of the objects in the world that our experiences represent.  Our sensory systems automatically and unconsciously *recover* the world through the complex information to which it has access. 

Unconscious inferences that produce stable representations (I.e. experience of a red apple) are *not* accessible to us through mere reflection, but neither are they ‘built in’ or ‘innate.’  They are, in short, trained through experience with the regularities of the world itself. The process of sensation is learned, not biologically determined. While contemporary psychophysics has advanced greatly since 1850, the basic model of how perception works in psychology today is Helmholtz's.

#### Major areas of research during the infancy of psychology
##### Sensation and Perception: Fechner

On the morning of 22nd of October, 1850, a young physiologist named Gustav Theodor Fechner lay in bed, puzzled by the relationship between the intensity of a psychological experience (i.e. hearing a sound, measured by introspection) and the intensity of the physical stimulus (i.e. the amplitude of the air vibrations). On that morning, it occurred to him that the relative increase in the physical stimulus might correspond to the relative increase in the psychological experience.  It took him a decade to prepare the idea for publication, which he presented as 'Weber's law':

&lt;!--\[ dp  = k(dS/S) \]--&gt;

where dp is the change in the psychological experience, k is a constant to be determined experimentally, dS is the change in the stimulus and S is the stimulus. He added to this the idea that the physical stimulus must break a certain threshold to be perceivable at all to derive what is now known as 'Fechner's law’:

&lt;!--\[ p = k\ln(S/S_{0}) \] --&gt;

Where S0 is the threshold under which the stimulus is not perceived.

Fechner's law is the first mathematical law (some might say 'model') in psychology.  It posits a specific relationship between a psychological entity (sensation) and a physical entity (the stimulus).  Unlike his predecessors who had contented themselves with discovering the relationships between ideas in a rather imprecise way, Fechner had both bridged the divide between the psychological and the physical, and given that bridge the precision of Calculus.  

Fechner's book, Elements of Psychophysics, published in 1860, had a profound effect in both Germany and England.  Physiologists now had a model of precision for which they could strive. And psychologists had a model of understanding the relationships between the physical and the psychological. Most importantly, however, the book inspired Hermann Ebbinghaus to begin studying memory.  But that story will have to be left to another time.

##### Introspection: Wundt

Today, we generally consider Wilhem Wundt's lab at Leipzig to be the first true psychological laboratory.  Helmholtz's lab, it is argued, was a lab of physiology, not psychology. But that distinction can be argued over. Wundt, unlike Helmholtz, believed that the causal relations governing ideas and experience were of a different *kind* than those governing the physical world. And it was the challenge of psychology to discover those laws and observe those regularities.

Wundt was, however, a student of Helmholtz. He didn’t run off an join Descartes in reflection.  Rather, he believed that the proper explanation of the laws of psychology would make use of the properties of the central nervous system. In Wundt's own words:

&gt;Physiology and psychology cover, between them, the field of vital phenomena; they deal with the facts of life at large, and in particular with the facts of human life. Physiology is concerned with all those phenomena of life that present themselves to us in sense perception as bodily processes, and accordingly form part of that total environment which we name the external world. **Psychology, on the other hand, seeks to give account of the interconnection of processes which are evinced by our own consciousness**, or which we infer from such manifestations of the bodily life in other creatures as indicate the presence of a consciousness similar to our own. (1902, p. 1)

Shortly thereafter, he asserts that Psychology is “**the investigation of conscious process in the modes of connection peculiar to them.**” [p. 2][#Wundt:1902vf]) As consciousness is a unique phenomenon in this world, it can only, then, be approached with the investigative tools unique to consciousness: direct experience of consciousness by ourselves of inferred in others on the basis of direct observation and analogy. This does not mean, however, that a science of psychology is purely introspective. On the contrary, Wundt proposed a 'physiological psychology': a theory of conscious experience informed by our physiological understanding of the brain, what Wundt calls the 'bodily substrate of mental life.'

The nervous system was thought to be made up of a 'central substance' that maintained an equilibrium and 'nerve-fibres' that connected cells together. This 'central stuff' was understood not to just transmit information, but to modify it in one of two ways: first, if it were exposed to repeated stimulus, the amount of energy needed to produce a response would decrease, and second, in some cases, it could invert the signal into it's opposite (i.e. from 'x more than equilibrium' to 'x less than equilibrium'). Wundt sought to reduce Hume’s four standard 'Laws of Association' of ideas—similarity, contrast, spatial and temporal contiguity— to simple 'internal connection', as 'contrast' is a completion of an idea in the same way 'similarity' is; and contiguity in space and time are external, not internal, relationships. Ideas tend to produce their contrasting idea, rather than ideas which are similar, when they are accompanied by strong feelings, as all feelings have a kind of 'elasticity' to them, always presenting with its opposite feeling implicitly.

'Internal connection,' is then is explained by what Wundt called 'central innervation,' or the properties of the nervous system. [#Wundt:1876vu] It is a fundamental law of neuroscience, even then, that 'neurons that wire together fire together.'  For Wundt and his followers, the similarity and contrast of ideas was explainable by the excitation and inhibition properties of these nerves.

##### Behavior: Pavlov

Ivan Pavlov was, like the others in this section, a physiologist first. His interest in psychology was, for the most part, tangential to his work in physiology. Between 1891 and 1900, Pavlov conducted a series of experiments on salivation in dogs. His primary interest at this time was to explain why dogs salivated when presented with food at a distance. The common-sense psychological explanation, of course, is that the dog wants the food. Or even that the dog *imagines* or *anticipates* having the food. More technically, early psychologists would have said the dog *associates* food and saliva. But these are not physiological explanations, and they would not satisfy Pavlov.

Using a recently invented apparatus, Pavlov was able to measure the amount of saliva dogs produced in response to a food stimulus. After a number of experiments, Pavlov noticed that the dogs were salivating without any food present. It occurred to him that in these case, the dogs' salivation response might be responding to the lab techs, rather than food itself. To test this hypothesis, he presented food to a dog and simultaneously rang a bell. After repeated exposures to this combination of stimuli, Pavlov removed the food, leaving just the bell. He found that the dogs still salivated.

Thus, Pavlov discovered what came to be called 'classical conditioning': to train a behavior, one presents a new stimulus (the conditioned stimulus) concurrently with the stimulus that 'naturally' produces the desired behavior (the unconditioned stimulus). After repeated training, the desired behavior (conditional response) will occur with the new (conditioned) stimulus, without the presence of the original, 'natural,' unconditioned stimulus.

Pavlov's primary application of his findings were to the nervous system as a whole as well as “heart, digestive tract and other organs in the higher animals” (lecture 23), he didn't shy away from suggesting that it could be used to explain the seemingly involuntary habitual actions of those deemed 'psychotic' or 'neurotic.' Conditional responses were, however, breakable, or in behaviorists terms 'extinguishable,' if one conditioned a new stimulus in place of the existing stimulus-response association.

Pavlov placed particular emphasis on the idea that his experiments were purely objective and not open to observer influence, such as the experiments of the Wundt and his ‘introspectivists.’ In fact, he closes his 1927 lectures with the bold claim that:

&gt;all the experiments, those of other workers as well as our own, which have set as their object a purely physiological interpretation of the activity of the higher nervous system, I regard as being in the nature only of a preliminary inquiry, which has however, I fully believe, entirely justified its inception. We have indisputably the right to claim that our investigation of this extraordinarily complex field has followed the right direction, and that, although not a near, nevertheless a complete, success awaits it. [#Pavlov:1946ws]

The importance of Pavlov's theorizing should be obvious at this point: classical conditioning provided a physiological law-like relationship that could take the place of (provide the bodily substrate for) the association of ideas. And it provides a mechanisms for creating, intervening in, or destroying those associations—which no previous theory had managed to do thus far.
#### American Psychology: William James and the function of consciousness

During this period of profound growth and advancement of psychology in Germany, American Universities were not institutions of research, but institutions of education. Starting in about 1876, that started to change. Johns Hopkins University was founded in Baltimore in 1876 with the explicit mission of "The encouragement of research; the encouragement of young men; the advancement of individual scholars, who by their excellence will advance the sciences they pursue, and the society where they dwell." 

Of the 53 men appointed to the faculty of Hopkins by 1884, nearly all had been educated at German Universities, and 13 held what was then a German degree, the “PhD.” The few exceptions to this rule were the eminent American pragmatists John Dewey and C.S. Peirce.  

What followed can only be described as an explosion in research universities in America. Clark University was founded in 1887 and the University of Chicago in 1892.  In 1860, no PhDs were awarded in America. By 1890, 164 PhDs had been given. The first of these in ‘Psychology’ was given to G. Stanley Hall by Harvard in 1878.

I mention all of this because the German understanding of the science of the mind---specifically that of Helmholtz and his anti-vitalists---became synonymous with the understanding of research in Psychology during this period. In short, if one approached the mind in some fashion other than this experimental tradition, it simply was viewed as not contributing to research, and hence, was not considered suitable for graduate instruction. More often that not, advocates for views not in accordance with physiological-psychology were restricted to departments of philosophy or anthropology. A particularly good example of this kind of reasoning is G. Stanley Hall’s 1879 paper ‘Philosophy in the United States,’ in which he laments American Philosophy as little more mental discipline and moral training in the Christian tradition.

In the middle of this storm sits William James. James, in many ways, bridges the divide between the older approach to liberal education and the new approach to research as a function of the university. James himself accredits his interest in Psychology to his time spent in Germany, yet his entire career was spent teaching at the traditional college: Harvard. He advocated for experimentalists, but appeared to perform no psychological experiences himself. His students are the major figures in this first generation of research institutions and Psychology departments, including G. Stanley Hall; yet his position was always in the department of Philosophy, something he appeared to have insisted upon. James had a life-long friendship with the two Hopkins pragmatists, C.S. Peirce and John Dewey, who went on to supervise Christine Ladd-Franklin at Hopkins. Moreover, James was in frequent contact with the early British philosophers of mind including Alexander Bain, Herbert Spencer and John Sully.  

In 1878 James contracted with Henry Holt and company to write a textbook for this nascent field of psychology. The resultant book The Principles of Psychology is a classic in the field.  In it, James defines psychology as “the science of mental life, both of its phenomena and of their conditions” [p. 1][#James:1890wm]) and identified introspection as its chief method.

James held that consciousness (which was the central phenomenon to be studied by psychology) was like stream, encompassing much more than mere ‘associations’ of ideas. The associationists who followed Hume isolated experiences from their context, and provided a overly simplistic account. The object of study of psychology---the relations, tendencies and emotions that make up the stream of consciousness---are experienced directly in introspection, and form the basis of genuine scientific inquiry into the mind.

James' fellow pragmatists Peirce and Dewey went on to construct a theory of psychology focused on the  functions of mental states, what was called ultimately called “The Chicago School.”[#James:1904dz] Dewey argued that explanations of human activity that focused merely on the 'stimulus' and 'response' or the British thinker W.K. Clifford’s ‘reflex arcs' were inadequate characterizations of conscious states. In order to truly characterize, and then study, conscious states, science must take into account the function or end of those states. In his words:

&gt;the distinction of sensation and movement as stimulus and response respectively is not a distinction which can be regarded as descriptive of anything which holds of psychical events or existences as such. The only events to which the terms stimulus and response can be descriptively applied are to minor acts serving by their respective positions to the maintenance of some organized coördination. The conscious stimulus or sensation, and the conscious response or motion, have a special genesis or motivation, and a special end or function. The reflex arc theory, by neglecting, by abstracting from, this genesis and this function gives us one disjointed part of a process as if it were the whole. [p. 370][#Dewey:1896vt]

Functional psychology thus emphasizes the role mental entities play in an organisms behavior, not what those ideas represent, or the 'content' of those ideas.[#Dewey:gu][#Dewey:1916tl]

#### Experimentalism: Ebbinghaus and the unreliability of introspection

In or about 1878, inspired by Fechner's stunning results investigating sensation, Hermann Ebbinghaus started experimenting with memory. Ebbinghaus sought, like all of his contemporaries, to understand the association of ideas.  But he was worried, rightfully so, that using existing words or concepts in an experimental design would allow for the individual subject's previous experience with those words or concepts to influence the result of the experience. Thus, to isolate the association of ideas from any prior influence, he created long lists of nonsense syllables (VAM, ZOK, etc.) and set about memorizing them. He then precisely measured the number of repetitions or amount of time it took to repeat list perfectly, something he called trials to criterion.  As it turns out, the longer the list, the more time, or trials, it takes to memorize it.  But that wasn't all: he further tested the process of forgetting.

After some arbitrary period, Ebbinghaus would return to the same list and restart the entire process. If it took him the same number of repetitions to memorize the list to perfection, his forgetting would have been complete.  What Ebbinghaus found was that even if he could not introspectively recall items on the list after some time, it took fewer repetitions for him to learn the list to the criterion or perfection. Thus, a decade before Freud made it fashionable to believe in the unconscious, Ebbinghaus had demonstrated empirically that the mind could retain information that it could not bring to subjective, introspective awareness.

This discovery was a bombshell to the introspective protocols of Wundt and James. Pavlov had shown that 'unconscious' behaviors like salivation could be trained to a stimulus without the intervention of introspection, but Ebbinghaus showed that a paradigmatic psychological phenomenon—memory—was subject to the same training. While Ebbinghaus' work was originally published in 1885 in German, it was not published in English until 1913---which ’just happens’ to be the same year James Watson declared the beginning of the Behaviorist revolution.

#### Tichener---The Structure of Consciousness

E.B. Tichener was British psychologist who earned his Doctorate under Wundt’s direction in 1892. He emigrated to the US for a position at Cornell University in Ithaca, NY. For Tichener, Psychology was “*science of mental processes*” [p. 5][#Titchener:1896tr]. The term ‘mental’ should give us a little pause.  

Jump back, for a moment, to René Descartes. In &lt;!--\fullref{pre-historyofpsychology:empiricismaboutthemind}--&gt;, we discussed Descartes’ argument for the existence of the mind as separate from the body on the basis of language and language use.  

Titchener’s definition of ‘mental’ follows in the Cartesian tradition of introspectability: “A mental process is any process, falling within the range of our experience, in the origination and continuance of which are ourselves necessarily concerned.” [p. 5][#Titchener:1896tr] Psychology is the science f the ‘mind’ insofar as we understand ‘mind’ to be the sum total of mental processes experienced by an individual over the course of a lifetime.  

*The* problem of a Psychology is

&gt; (1) to analyze concrete (actual) mental experience into its simplest components, (2) to discover how these elements combine, what are ht flaws which govern their combination and (3) to bring them into connection with their physiological (bodily) conditions.  [p. 12][#Titchener:1896tr]

As science begins with analysis---breaking up phenonema into its component parts---the first task is to divide and separate mental processes until we arrive at the base unit of analysis: the mental experience.  Laws for combining and associating these experiences are then introduced, and the connection thereof to the physical body.

For Titchener, the fundamental unit---the ‘atom’, as it were---of psychology is sensation.  Sensation comes to experience fully formed, and cannot be further divided. Sensation is inherently personal, as no one can directly observe another’s sense experiences. Investigating sensation therefore requires introspection. But this does not mean it is unscientific. Indeed, introspection can be performed in reliable ways that would allow for replication by others:

&gt; *Have yourself placed under such conditions that there is as little likelihood as possible of external interference with the test to be made. Attend to the stimulus, and, when it is removed, recall the sensation by an act of memory. Give a verbal account of the processes constituting your consciousness of the stimulus.* [p. 36][#Titchener:1896tr]

Titchener’s influence on psychology was two-fold. First, he had a student, and devotee, named E.G. Boring.  Boring published his *History of Experimental Psychology* in 1929. As the first history of psychology, it largely shaped how Psychology understood itself, enshrining Tichener’s views on science as analysis and sensation and perception as the starting point in Psychology for generations. Second, Titchener’s insistence on Wundt’s introspective method as *the* starting point for Psychology sparked the first revolution: behaviorism.

#### Psychology’s First Revolution: Behaviorism

John B. Watson (1878-1958) opens his 1913 manifesto “Psychology as the Behaviorist Views it.” with the bold claim that **Psychology**

&gt;“**is a purely objective branch of natural science.** Its theoretical goal is the prediction and control of behavior. Introspection forms no essential part of its methods, nor is the scientific value of its data dependent upon the readiness with which they lend themselves to interpretation in terms of consciousness. The behaviorist, in his efforts to get a unitary scheme of animal response, recognizes no dividing line between man and brute. The behavior of man, with all of its refinement and complexity, forms only a part of the behaviorist's total scheme of investigation.” [p. 158][#Watson:1913tq]

In a 1929 debate with the Harvard professor and physiological-psychologist William MacDougall (1871-1938), Watson anticipated a common criticism of behaviorism: that it cannot explain our rich interior mental life---what William James called the “stream of consciousness.” Watson responded that if we were to take the inner mental life as the object of study, rather than observable behaviors, there would be “as many analyses as there are individual psychologists. There is no element of control. There is no way of experimentally attaching and solving psychological problems and standardizing methods.” Thus, psychologists must limit themselves to “things that can be observed, and formulate laws concerning only the observed things.” [#Watson:iMwU-3B8]

According to Watson, ‘observable things’ includes only “what the organism says or does,” which must then be described “in terms of ‘stimulus and response.’”  By ‘stimulus,’ Watson means “any object in the general environment or any change in the physiological condition of the animal, such as the change we get when we keep an animal from sex activity, when we keep it from feeding, when we keep it from building a nest. By response we mean that system of organized activity that we see emphasized anywhere in any kind of animal, as building a skyscraper, drawing plans, having babies, writing books, and the like.”

Watson’s behaviorism explains the behavior of all organisms (not just humans) by producing laws of correlation between stimuli and responses. This was a massive extension of the field of psychology, as animals and babies were not able to give introspective reports. Following Pavlov, Watson contends that an organism initially engages is some random behavior (say, a baby squirming) in response to a stimulus. This ‘unconditioned response’ may be biologically determined, but it is not yet a law of psychology.  To ‘condition’ a response, one presents the unconditioned stimulus along with a new stimulus repeatedly. Over time, the organism responds to the new, conditioned stimulus with the original unconditioned response. Thus, to explain any given behavior, one must find the conditioned stimulus that is now correlated with the conditioned response.

MacDougall, among others, challenged Watson to explain “thinking” or “thought”  in terms of stimulus and response.  Watson does not shy away from this challenge:

&gt; “The increasing dominance of language habits in the behavior of the developing child leads naturally over into the behaviorist's conception of thinking.  The behaviorist makes no mystery of thinking.  He holds that thinking is behavior, is motor organization, just like tennis playing or golf or any other form of muscular activity. But what kind of muscular activity? The muscular activity that he uses in talking. Thinking is merely talking, but talking with concealed musculature.” [p. 464][#Watson:2013ty]

According to Watson, a child initiates verbal behavior by talking aloud to and about his surroundings. As that behavior is negatively reinforced, it changes to mumbling to oneself, and ultimately to keeping one's lips closed. It follows that thinking is not an activity of the mind/brain alone, but a kinesthetic experience of the entire organism—in short, a behavior.  Words are, in Watson's view “the conditioned substitutes for our world of objects and acts. Thinking is a device for manipulating the world of objects when those objects are not present to the senses.” [][#Watson:iMwU-3B8]

##### Maturing Behaviorism: Tolman and Hull 

During the middle of the 20th century, behaviorism in American divided roughly into two camps: Tolman and Hull. Edward Chace Tolman (1886 – 1959) initiated the 'war' in 1922 by criticizing Watson.  Tolman argued that Watson's belief that all human behavior could be explained in terms of “muscle contraction and grand secretion, as such, would not be behaviorism at all but a mere physiology.” [p. 45][#Tolman:1922us]

For Tolman, a behavioristic science must answer three major problems: “(1), given the stimulating agency, determining the behavior-cues (2), given the behavior-cues, determining the behavior-object and (3), given the behavior-object, determining the behavior-act.” (p. 51).  (1) is the problem of psychophysics, which is adequately solved by Fechner. (2) is accessible, with rewording, by classical conditioning. (3) is the “important problem of motive.” A proper science of behavior must answer all three of these problems. Doing so, Tolman contends, would allow the behaviorist to understand and better elucidate introspection.

Opposing Tolman, Clark Hull (1884 – 1952) contended that in order for a postulate or theorem to be “truly scientific,” it must “take the form of specific statements of the outcome of concrete experimentations or observations.” [#Hull:1940tm] Simple classification of behavior are not, themselves, scientific. But neither is talk of such things as motives.  Scientific explanations must make use of clear, unambiguous terms that refer to  observable behavior. Everything else is simply not considered to be 'science.' Hull contends that psychology should produce mathematical equations that would specify precisely all the  relationships between variables that account for an organisms behavior. The specific behavior of a given organism would be an instance of these universal mathematical generalizations.

Hull's primary contribution to behaviorism is the thesis that that the when a given stimulus has the effect of reducing a biological need, the connection between the stimulus and the response is strengthened automatically. While that statement may seem like a commonsense position today (food given as a reward, e.g.), the important part of it in 1935 was the word of 'automatically.' Contrary to the introspectivists or even commonsense, one need not be aware of the satiation of one's physical desires in order to strengthen the association between the conditioned stimulus and the conditional response. In fact, most conditioned associations are not accessible to introspective awareness.

Methodologically, Hull's insistence on the mathematical-deductive structure of theory led to a cadre of young psychologists who were able to represent complex relationships between variables mathematically.[#Hull:1940tm] Many members of that generation ended up at Stanford, ultimately providing much of the theory of information processing that allowed the cognitivists to advance sophisticated mathematical and computer models of cognitive states.

In response to Hull, Tolman argued that simple stimulus-response connections were insufficient to explain behavior: specifically rats running a maze for a food reward.  In his famous 1948 paper “Cognitive Maps in Rats and Men,” Tolman presented evidence that showed rats that were allowed to wander around a maze randomly before the beginning of training period learned the maze more quickly than rats that began training without prior exposure to the maze. ([#Tolman:1948kv]) Tolman argued that the best explanation for this phenomenon---and our general intuition about why rats appear to pause before beginning down a specific course---is that the rats have built up a 'cognitive map' of the maze through their random explorations.  He goes so far as to suggest that the rats had the ability to learn through 'Vicarious Trial and Error,' or 'imagining' what would happen if they responded to a particular stimulus.  For Tolman, this was:

&gt;evidence that in the critical stages-whether in the first picking up of the instructions or in the later making sure of which stimulus is which-the animal's activity is not just one of  responding passively to discrete stimuli, but rather one of the active selecting and comparing of stimuli. [p. 200][#Tolman:1948kv]

One of Tolman's students, Ritchie, constructed further experiments to test the capacity of the rats' cognitive maps. By starting rats on the far side of the laboratory, Ritchie found that the rats tended to navigate not by the direct path to the reward, but to the walls of the room itself. Thus, Tolman contends, the rats' cognitive maps were 'strip-like' and 'narrow.'

It is this concept—the breadth or narrowness of cognitive maps—that allows Tolman to extrapolate to the human mind, going so far to suggest that we may interpret the various psychological mechanisms posited by psychoanalysts as “narrowings of our cognitive maps due to too strong motivations or too intense frustration.” Thus, racists, sexists, pathological patriots, etc. are individuals with too narrow a 'cognitive map.' A healthy mind---and a well educated person---is one who can use reason, i.e. “broad cognitive maps” to

&gt;“look before and after, learning to see that there are often round-about and safer paths to their quite proper goals-learn, that is, to realize that the well-beings of White and of Negro, of Catholic and Protestant, of Christian and of Jew, of American and Russian (and even of males and females) are mutually interdependent.” [p. 208][#Tolman:1948kv]

##### Operant Conditioning &amp; Radical Behaviorism: Skinner

Starting in 1938, Behaviorism underwent a radical transformation.  In that year, Burrhus Frederic Skinner (1904 – 1990) published The Behavior of Organisms: An Experimental Analysis, in which he introduced the idea of operant conditioning. ([#Anonymous:Auva_WZ2]) Skinner's insight was not entirely without precedent, but rather built upon the concept of 'instrumental conditioning' originally introduced by Edward Thorndike (1874-1949).  

According to what is now called 'Thorndike's law of effect', if a response is followed closely by a pleasurable experience, it is more likely to be associated with the stimulus than if it is followed by a unpleasurable or neutral experience. Skinner turned this idea into the central explanatory mechanism of behaviorism: rather than the conditioned stimulus occurring simultaneously with the unconditioned stimulus, the conditioning stimulus occurs immediately after the desired behavior as a consequence of the desired behavior. In his own words:

&gt;Operant behavior usually affects the environment and generates stimuli which is “feed back” to the organism. Some feedback may have the effects identified by the layman as reward or punishment.  Any consequence of behavior which is rewarding or, more technically, reinforcing increases the probability of further responding. [p. 129][#Skinner:1972wq]

By introducing the idea of reinforcement of a behavior as whatever makes it more likely that that behavior will occur, Skinner was able to undercut Tolman's (and MacDougall's before him) insistence that a purpose or goal was required to explain the behavior of animals.

As a boy, Skinner was fascinated with mechanisms.  Legend has it that he even built a steam cannon out of a discarded water boiler. Extraordinarily intelligent, Skinner found Francis Bacon's works at about fourteen, and became enamored with the idea that Bacon may have written Shakespeare's plays.  He majored in English and literature at Hamilton College, where he became famous for elaborate practical jokes.  During his time at Hamilton, he expressed significant interest in the authors Joyce and Proust – but also physiological psychologists Pavlov and Jacques Loeb. Legend has it that he met Robert Frost, who encouraged him to become a writer.   After that did not pan out, he returned to behaviorism through the work of Bertrand Russell---specifically Russell's comparison between 'reflex' and 'force' in physics.

Inspired by Pavlov's maxim “control the environment and you will see order in behavior,” as well as his passion for inventing mechanisms, Skinner began to create machines that would control behavior of an organism by automatically rewarding the desired behavior and punishing behavior that was not desired.

These successes led Skinner to hypothesize that all animal behavior---including human behavior---resulted from such forces. He delineated four types of operant conditioning: positive reinforcement, negative reinforcement, punishment and extinction, which he studied with mathematical precision. Skinner shifted behaviorism's emphasis from reflexes to regularities of the whole organism, moving from the causal link between stimulus and response to the relationship between the response and its reinforcement.

According to Skinner, this form of behaviorism was the inevitable development of psychology into a full-fledged science. Often pulling on an analogy to the history of physics, chemistry and biology, he argued that 'consciousness' and 'inner causes' were the remnants of superstition, and human psychology and society could be perfected through the principles of operant conditioning.  

Skinner adamantly insisted that scientific inquiry could not countenance hypothetical unobservable entities. Following Russell, Skinner argued that explaining a given behavior, such as 'eating,' in terms of a mental state, such as 'being hungry,' was ad hoc, equivalent to the pre-scientific explanation of physical events in terms of vitalistic 'forces.'  For example, if I explain why a glass breaks by referring to it's fragility, I've really explained nothing at all---I’ve only explained breaking in terms of being likely to break.  A genuine explanation of a glass's breaking is in terms of the environmental conditions and events immediately prior to the breaking of the glass. Likewise, explaining eating in terms of 'hunger' is hollow, repeating only the likelihood of eating behavior.

 Throughout his career, Skinner argued that radical behaviorism alone was the scientific approach to psychology. Theories---including Hull’s---cannot refer to underlying entities. When one objects that paradigmatic sciences like physics postulate unobservable underlying entities such as electrons, Skinner retorts that these are not believed by physics to really exist, but are merely convenient placeholders for the mathematical relationships that hold between observable entities. A scientist must restrict his or her work to observation, not theorizing. In retrospective appraisal of his own work, Skinner would claim of his work in Behavior of Organisms:

&gt;The notes, data, and publications which I have examined do not show that I ever behaved in the manner of Man Thinking as described by John Stuart Mill or John Dewey or in reconstructions of scientific behavior by other philosophers of science.  I never faced a Problem which was more than the eternal problem of finding order. I never attacked a problem by constructing a Hypothesis.  I never deduced Theorems or submitted them to Experimental Check. So far as I can see, I had no preconceived Mode of behavior—certainly not a physiological or mentalistic one and, I believe, not a conceptual one.” (1972, p. 112)

In the years following, Behaviorism came to utterly dominate American Psychology.  By 1960, for example, the standard textbook for experimental psychology, Burton G. Andreas' Experimental Psychology could confidently assert:

**Psychology seeks to express the laws of behavior.** It makes the assumption that all aspects of behavior, like other natural phenomena, are dependent on the conditions under which the behavior occurs... Psychology seeks to describe the dependence of the activities of people or animals on their environments and states of being. Psychology's place is delineated by this particular goal and the specific techniques devised for striving toward it. [p. 4][#Andreas:WVE4neKa]

#### Concurrent developments: Logic and Computing

In 1812, George Boole (1815-1864) published The Laws of Thought, which is now regularly classified as a classic work in Logic. The opening paragraph, however, suggests a different discipline:

&gt; The design of the following treatise is to investigate the fundamental laws of those operations of the mind by which reasoning is performed; to give expression to them in the symbolic language of a Calculus, and upon this foundation to establish the science of Logic and construct its method; to make that method itself the basis of a general method for the application of the mathematical doctrine of Probabilities; and, finally, to collect from the various elements of truth brought to view in the course of these inquiries some probable intimations concerning the nature and constitution of the human mind. --- Laws of Thought (1854) Ch1 Para1

Boole, like his predecessor David Hume, believed that the rules that regulate the human mind were simple, and complex ideas were structured out of simple ones in the same way complex theorems are constructed out of simple axioms via logical transformations.

The history of Logic is of great importance here because in 1950, a brilliant young logician named Alan Turing proposed a theoretical physical machine that would be capable of carrying out logical functions.  That theoretical machine ultimately became the digital computer we know today.

He further proposed that such a machine could be taught to understand human language, and one could test the sophistication of that teaching by a simple empirical test, now known as the 'Turing test.'  An interviewer would have a conversation with two individuals, one human and one computer, for a period of time. If, after five minutes or so, the interviewer could not tell the difference between the two, we would be in a position of calling the machine a 'thinking' machine.  Writing in 1950, Turing claims:

&gt;“I believe that in about fifty years' time it will be possible, to programme computers, with a storage capacity of about 109, to make them play the imitation game so well that an average interrogator will not have more than 70 per cent chance of making the right identification after five minutes of questioning.”

In short, Turing's ideal machine would 'respond to the sense of all that will be said in its presence, as even the dullest men can do.'   The challenge set by Descartes and dreamt about by Hobbes, Locke and Hume to create a physical device capable of using language in a productive and systematic way was to be met, at least, theoretically, by a machine, the digital computer.

The question that remains for you, in the course of this game, is whether or not Turing's discovery of the logical functions that meet Descartes' challenge in fact lead to, in Boole's words “probable intimations concerning the nature and constitution of the human mind,” and whether or not those 'probable intimations' are scientific in nature.

#### The Second Revolution: Cognitive Science

In 1957, two books were published on the topic of language use by humans. As we have discussed, philosophers of mind have long considered language-use *the* defining characteristic of humanity---the behavior that distinguishes humans from animals and thinking from instinct. The empirical study of language-use therefore, has the potential to quantify, analyze and observe, with scientific reliability, what we are as thinking beings.

In the first, Verbal Behavior, B.F. Skinner explained humans' language use in terms of operant conditioning.  Verbal behavior is particularly interesting for the behaviorist because it isn't directly reinforced by the world, but rather mediated by another person via his or her own verbal behavior. In fact, this unique feature comes to form Skinner's definition of verbal behaviors: those behaviors that are 'reinforced through the mediation of other persons' (1957, p. 2). He later refines and restricts that definition thus: “If we make the further provision that the 'listener' must be responding in ways which have been conditioned precisely in order to reinforce the behavior of the speaker, we narrow our subject to what is traditionally recognized as the verbal field.” (p. 225) This definition, you'll no doubt notice, makes no reference to vocalization, words, sentences, thoughts, phonemes, meanings, semantics, grammar, or anything else typically associated with language-behavior.

The second was Noam Chomsky's first book, Syntactic Structures. Chomsky opens by noting that the set of all grammatical sentences in any given language, while infinite, is not random. There are sentences like 'Colorless green ideas sleep furiously' which may have never occurred in English before 1957, but nonetheless are grammatical sentences; while at the same time, there are sentences like 'Furiously sleep ideas green colorless' that are not grammatical. He then proposes that an adequate theory of language ought to describe a device that generates all and only the sentences that are grammatical in that language. Any theory that can't generate the set of grammatical sentences simply is not an adequate explanation of human language-behavior.

Central to Chomsky's theory is the thesis that humans differ from animals in their ability to use language. You'll remember from the beginning of this history that that view was shared by Rene Descartes and the Port-Royalists, who used it to argue for the distinction between the soul (mind) and the body. For Chomsky, however, the ability to use language does not entail a non-physical soul. Turing's machines showed that a physical entitled generate new and novel sentences that follow the grammatical structures. Verbal behavior, the defining feature of human psychology, is the ability to structure sentences in new and novel ways via the process of recursion, but that does not mean that human minds are non-physical entities.

Not only do the cognitivists reject the behaviorists conjecture that one can explain human behavior without reference to internal states, they reject the behaviorists rejection of the thesis that there is a dividing like between “man and brutes.”

In 1959, Chomsky published a vitriolic review of Skinner's Verbal Behavior, in which he claimed that not only were Skinner's definitions of reinforcement and conditioning either confused or circular, he argues that empirically, children learn grammar at a higher rate than can be explained by operant conditioning. It is included in the appendix.

In the decade before these tumultuous years, the Macy foundation had sponsored series of conferences that introduced some of great early mathematicians and computer scientists including John von Neumann (father of most computer languages), Norbert Wiener (founder of cybernetics), Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts (who together created a mathematical model of a neuron, which is the basis for all neural network architecture), Julian Bigelow and Arutuo Rosenblueth (also pioneering cyberneticists) to the great social scientists and psychologists of the day, including the anthropologist Margaret Mead, the Gestalt psychologist Wolfgang Köhler. The goal of these workshops was to investigate the similarities between computational machines and human minds and social structures. Behaviorists almost never attended. While the results from these conferences were minimal, they set the stage for MIT's Second Symposium on Information theory, September 10-12 1956, that forever changed forever the face of psychology.  

At that conference, Alan Newell and Herbert Simon, computer scientists from Carnegie-Melon, presented a simple machine that could do logic proofs and Noam Chomsky presented his idea of a transformative-generative grammar as the basis of language. George Miller writes, in an unpublished paper presented at MIT and repeatedly cited by historians of cognitive science, that he came away from the conference with a sense “more intuitive than rational, that human experimental psychology, theoretical linguistics, and the computer simulation of the cognitive process were all the pieces from a larger whole, and that the future would see a progressive elaboration and coordination of their shared concerns.”  Miller recalls Newell telling him “Chomsky was developing exactly the same kind of ideas for language that he and Herb Simon were developing for theorem-proving.” [#MILLER:1979tt]

And so began “the Cognitive Revolution.”

            <Comments>The four idols distinguished by Bacon are the idols of the tribe, the cave, the marketplace and the theater.  The idols of the tribe are those which we all share, as a function of our biology. They “have their origin either in the regularity of the substance of the human spirit; or in its prejudices; or in its limitations; or in its restless movement; or in the influence of the emotions; or in the limited powers of the senses; or in the mode of impression” (LII)
The idols of the cave are those of an individual. They have their origin in “the individual nature of each man's mind and body; and also in his education, way of life and chance events.” (LIII)
The idols of the marketplace are those of miscommunication and misunderstanding. As Bacon says “For men believe that their reason controls words. But it is also true that words retort and turn their force back upon the understanding; and this has rendered philosophy and the science sophistic and unproductive.” (LIX)
The idols of the theater are those of intellectual 'showmanship.' They are “not innate or stealthily slipped into the understanding; they are openly introduced and accepted on the basis of fairytale theories and mistaken rules of proof.” (LXI)
All quotes from Bacon &amp; Jardin (2000).  Roman numerals indicate Aphorism number.
For those of you who have read Rene Descartes *Meditations on First Philosophy* will no doubt recognize that Descartes predicated his entire philosophical system on the idea that working alone by pure reflection, he could discover immutable truths about the universe.
Bacon lists 27 different types of these 'privileged instances' in Book 2 of his Novum Organon.
There are many instances of this claim in the history of psychology: see, e.g. Wundt, 1876 (p. 175)
I can illustrate some of the differences in theoretical approach here with the example of color perception: Helmholtz posited that there were three basic primary colors: red, green and purple.  Ladd-Franklin argued that purple perceptually appeared to be (i.e. ‘looked like’) a mixture of red and blue, whereas yellow appeared to be primary. Thus, she theorized, there are in fact four psychologically primary colors: red, green, blue and yellow.  Helmholtz responded (quoted in Hering) that one could not draw conclusions about facts of physiology from direct psychological experience (i.e. introspection), therefore Ladd-Franklin’s observation had no bearing on the science of psychology.  While Ladd-Franklin’s point seems obvious and definitive against Helmholtz’s theory, it was widely rejected, on the basis of the unreliability of introspective reports and observations, in favor of the physiological reductionism of Helmholtz. In fact, it wasn’t until a plausible mathematical model based on Ladd-Franklin’s observation was proposed by Jameson and Hurvich in 1957 that the psychological community rejected Helmholtz’s theory in favor of Ladd-Franklin’s.
Experienced Reactors may recognize Helmholtz’ name from the Darwin Game.
*a priori* is a philosophical term meaning ‘prior to experience.’ It is frequently used to describe philosophical positions like Descartes’ that believe knowledge can be gained by reflection alone. In this case, it means that the nerves have assumptions about the world ‘built in’ before experience.  If you wanted to use a computer analogy, Müller believes that knowledge about time and space is encoded in our hardware, where the empiricists like Hobbes, Locke and Hume believe it is in software that is built through experience.
I am skipping, for the sake of space, the fascinating history of British psychology during this period, as it adapted associationism to the new physiology. See [#Daston:1978vx]
Daniel Coit Gilman, the first President of Johns Hopkins, admired not just the German University, but what he called the "German Mind" as well: “The thoroughness of the German mind, its desire for perfection in every detail, and its philosophical aptitudes are well illustrated by the controversies now in vogue in the land of universities.”(http://webapps.jhu.edu/jhuniverse/information_about_hopkins/about_jhu/daniel_coit_gilman/)
See Ch. V of [#Miller:1962vk]
George Miller argues argues that “If Watson had not been so inept as a philosopher, he might have offered behaviorism as a pragmatic theory of mind, comparable to Peirce’s pragmatic theory of meaning, James’ pragmatic theory of truth, and Dewey’s pragmatic theory of value.”[p. 66][#Miller:1962vk]
See &lt;!--\fullref{theparadigminexperimentalpsychology:hermannebbinghaus}--&gt; for more on Ebbinghaus’ experiments. [#Ebbinghaus:1885ud]
Students who have read Descartes ‘methods’ will no doubt recognize his continuing influence on Titchener’s thinking.
Much of Titchener’s work looks, to the contemporary reader, more like philosophy and phenomenology than psychology.
Today, Tolman is sometimes called a ‘Cognitive Behaviorist’ (see [#HOLLAND:2008ci], e.g.) The term was used by Hull’s defender, Spence, to refer to Tolman’s views in 1950. ([#Spence:1950fx]).
In the interests of conciseness, I am skipping over the fascinating and under-rated history of Gestalt psychology. I do this with a heavy heart, as it is one of my favorite topics in the history of psychology. Characters who wish to engage with the tradition of behaviorism, however, should pay careful attention to Wolfgang Köhler's presidential address, included in the appendix, for the Gestalt concerns about this period in American Psychology.
This is only one of Hull's four criteria. The other are: (1) The definitions and postulates of a scientific system should be stated in a clear and unambiguous manner, they should be consistent with one another, and they should be of such a nature that they permit rigorous deductions. (2) The labor of deducing the potential implications of the postulates of a system should be performed with meticulous care and exhibited, preferably step by step and in full detail. It is these deductions which constitute the substance of a system. (4) The theorems so deduced which concern phenomena not already known must be submitted to carefully controlled experiments. The outcome of these critical experiments, as well as all previous ones, must agree with the corresponding theorems making up the system.
See the section on behaviorism in the 'Public Character info' section for more on the difference between operant and classical conditioning.
“Gradually it was found that all the equations could be written down without bringing in forces. What was observable was a certain relation between acceleration and configuration; to say that this relation was drought about by the intermediacy of 'force' was to add nothing to our knowledge. Observation shows that planets have at all times an acceleration towards the sun, which varies inversely as the square of their distance from it.  To say that this is due to the 'force' of gravitation is merely verbal, like saying that opium makes people sleep because it has a dormitive virtue. The modern physicist, therefore, merely states formulae which determine accelerations, and avoids the word 'force' altogether. 'Force' was the faint ghost of the vitalist view as to the causes of motions, and gradually the ghost has been exorcized.” [p 495][#Russell:2013wy]
