\f0\fs20 \cf0 I hope the reader recognizes that I am speaking here as Mead did, and as one would in the 1970s\'92. I don\'92t believe a word of this, as you might expect. To contemporary thinking, Mead\'92s presumption of simplicity of the Somoan culture and language is the core failing of her study.}]]></Comment>
