\pard\pardeftab720\sb240\sa120\partightenfactor0

\f2 \cf0 \
What makes a certain condition a \'91mental\'92 condition or a 'medical' or \'92neurological\'92 condition?  Suppose you are a family doctor, and a patient presents with an unwelcome and unwanted problem---a twitch, perhaps. Do you call a psychiatrist or a neurologist? How do you know?
\f0 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sb240\sa120\partightenfactor0

\f3 \cf0 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sa120\partightenfactor0
\cf0 While behaviors associated with mental illness---hallucinations, catatonic states, mania, etc.---have been known since ancient times, psychiatry dates its regularization as a scientific discipline to the work of the French physician Phillipe Pinel. His
\f4\i  *Trait\'e9 m\'e9dico-philosophique sur l'ali\'e9nation mentale; ou la manie*
\f3\i0  stands as the first attempt at a scientific classification of mental illness. The book, translated as
\f4\i  *Treatise on Insanity*
\f3\i0  in 1806 by D.D. Davis, is excerpted in Appendix 
\f5\b `\\fullref\{app: pinel\}`\{=latex\}
\f3\b0 .  
\f0 \

\f3 \
Pinel was an intellectual disciple of \'c9tienne Bonnot de Condillac, who in turn, was a disciple of John {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "scrivcmt://3C331A63-E57A-4032-9CF4-36ACE9DB924B"}}{\fldrslt Locke.}} Locke is most well known as the intellectual progenitor of the American Constitution, but his views on the nature of mind and the empirical basis of knowledge held sway over much of the Western intellectual world in the first half of the 19\super th\nosupersub  century.  Locke's influence on Condillac and hence Pinel was two-fold: first, he held that all our ideas originate in sensation and reflection. Second, and as importantly, Locke followed Francis Bacon in teaching that all knowledge must be based on careful, systematic observation.
\f0 \

\f3 \
For the empiricists, it follows that insanity, which is a severe form of our ideas 'leading us astray', is explained by a incorrect connection and association of ideas. The mechanism is simple: some of our ideas have a natural affinity or connection with one another. Others are held together by mere custom or habit. Cases of insanity are cases where habitual associations become so disorganized they begin to effect the 'natural' associations. This misassociation can become so extreme that it can \'93set us awry in our actions, as well moral as natural, passions, reasonings, and notions themselves\'94 [Bk 2, Ch 33, p9. Pg. 531][#Locke:1959wj]. To this day, we use metaphors like 'lost his senses' to describe someone with mental illness; and we describe poorly chosen actions as 'not very sensible.'
\f0 \

\f3 \
This is simply the theoretical basis for understanding insanity in the broadest possible terms.  To truly understand how mental disorder is defined and classified, we must consider how the mentally ill have been treated.

\f0\b0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sa120\partightenfactor0

\f3 \cf0 \
Phillipe Pinel (1745-1826) revolutionized the treatment of the insane. When, in 1792, he was appointed a physician at the main asylum in Paris---the Bic\'eatre hospital---the situation was dire. According to a biographer in 1846:
\f0 \

\f3 \
\pard\pardeftab720\li283\partightenfactor0
\cf0 > The buildings were unfit for habitation. In them were congregated men crouching together in the mud, in stone cells, narrow, cold, damp, destitute of air and light, and merely furnished with a straw bed, seldom renewed, and soon becoming foul and offensive; wretched dens, in which one would hesitate to place the meanest animal. The insane, who were immured in these filthy holes, were at the mercy of their attendants, and these persons were malefactors released from prison. The wretched patients were loaded with chains and manacled like convicts. Thus given up defenseless to the wickedness of their guardians, they were the sports of an insulting mockery, or of a brutality all the more blind that it was gratuitous. [p. 194-195][#Marx:1847vc]
\f0 \

\f3 \
\pard\pardeftab720\li283\fi-283\partightenfactor0
\cf0 Upon his arrival, Pinel immediately began advocating pity, respect, and compassion for the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "scrivcmt://7A7FFC94-0C0C-4A51-9F42-6686685D2B9C"}}{\fldrslt patients,}} not only for humanitarian reasons, but also in order to allow the Baconian method of careful observation. Given the terrible conditions at the Bic\'eatre, Pines argued, one would never be able to determine if the behavior of the patients was the result of some underlying condition, or the condition of the Hospital itself. Bic\'eatre's chief physician, Pussin, was sympathetic to Pinel's techniques, and began a pilot study of unchaining the patients.
\f0 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f3 \cf0 \
\
Two years later, Pinel was appointed  chief physician of the Hospice de la Salp\'eatri\'e8re---Paris' parallel institution for women. There, the women were kept chained, often naked, in subterranean cells; subjected to the terrors of abusive guards and hungry rats. Pinel immediate banned the use of metal chains as restraints, allowed the women clothing, and established something resembling human {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "scrivcmt://7FECA261-7B48-470E-A91E-5A9C4DCDD80E"}}{\fldrslt civility.}} This act was mythologized during the French Revolution as part of the overthrow of the aristocratic order, and has been duly commemorated in {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "scrivcmt://8C87EF07-8E1C-4A6B-8A54-AD082F798149"}}{\fldrslt Art.}}
\f0 \

\f3 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sa120\partightenfactor0
\cf0 Pinel's revolutionary kindness is not just a story of a sympathetic humanitarian.  Pinel's goal was to systematical classify mental illness in the Baconian manner.  The conditions of confinement found in the Bic\'eatre and the Salp\'eatri\'e8re compounded the patients' mental illness, and confounded his attempts at observation. In these conditions, one could not determine if the regularity of symptoms found in the population resulted from the illness or the \'91treatment.\'92 By providing the patients respect and dignity, he believed he could observe their mental illness in a more untainted form.
\f0 \

\f3 \
In general, Pinel followed Locke and Condillac in holding that insanity was 'derangement of the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "scrivcmt://A33ED385-FF53-4CEC-A511-EA76E8B98C64"}}{\fldrslt understanding\'92}}, yet extended the view to cover cases where memory, understanding and judgment were perfectly sound, and still the patient was maniacal. \
\
Pinel thus abandoned any formal all-encompassing theoretical explanation of insanity
\f4\i  per se
\f3\i0 , especially that which originated in Ancient Greek thought. The Greeks, he reasoned, were wrong about how the human brain functions, as we now understood. And as their system was based on their mistaken physiology, it is unreliable. \
\
Instead, Pinel explicitly bases his system on \'93the numerous and important facts which have been discovered and detailed by modern pneumatologists\'94 [p. 135][#Pinel:1806ws] \

\f3 \cf0 \
Pinel spent a great amount of time showing that the conditions he was treating did not have a physiological basis. Much of his argumentation in
\f4\i  Treatise on Insanity
\f3\i0  turns on the dissections performed on patients who had died while at the Bic\'eatre. The reason for this was two-fold: first, the ancient Aristotlean understanding of the mind held that mental illness resulted from too much or too little of one of the four main 'humours': black bile, yellow bile, blood and {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "scrivcmt://FD455F78-A434-40CA-A2E3-50030E65CA4D"}}{\fldrslt phlegm.}}  By showing that the mentally ill had no significant lesions in the brain, or imbalances in their 'fluids', Pinel was able to establish the independence of psychiatry from other forms of medicine.
\f0 \

\f3 \
Secondly, there is a long tradition of defining the 'mental' as that which is opposed to the 'physical'. For example, Rene Descartes famously argues that the actions of our bodies can be explained entirely in physical, mechanistic terms, except that which can be attributed to, in his terms, our 'souls.'  It follows then, that if an illness is to be truly
\f4\i  mental
\f3\i0 , it must not have a physical explanation. And most importantly, physical causes are treated with physical interventions. As insanity was now deemed non-physical, the treatment cannot be physical. Hence, psychiatry is a discipline independent from physical medicine.
\f0 \

\f3 \
\pard\pardeftab720\li283\fi-283\partightenfactor0

\fs20 \cf0 While Pinel had no strong theoretical commitment or agenda, by following Locke's notion of mental illness as a confusion of ideas, he made two significant contributions to both psychiatry as a medical discipline and our understanding of the mind more broadly: First, if insanity was just a misassociation of ideas, it was not a permanent, inherited incurable disease. Second, if insanity is a misassociation of ideas, it does not depend on or result from physiological changes. Explanations for mental illness thus did not require autopsy; and treatment did not require {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "scrivcmt://5BDD5D0F-07A9-400E-8A45-7D9D1DC3CD0C"}}{\fldrslt surgery.}} Psychiatry was, as a result, independent of medicine.
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sa120\partightenfactor0

\fs24 \cf0 It is likewise important to recognize that Pinel was, in many ways, precisely following Bacon's system of investigation. He was not attempting to form an overarching explanation. He was setting down tables upon tables of observed facts, classifying and arranging phenomena, highlighting privileged instances, and was open to any and all techniques that might shed light on these cases. After initial observation, he split \'93insanity\'94 into four varieties, distinguishing between the incurable dementia and idiocy from the often transient and curable mania and melancholy.
\f0 \

\f3 \
Therapeutically, Pinel called his humane treatment of the insane the 'moral treatment.' In his words,
\f0 \

\f3 \
\pard\pardeftab720\li283\partightenfactor0
\cf0 >I then discovered, that insanity was curable in many instances, by mildness of treatment and attention to the state of the mind exclusively, and when coercion was indispensable, that it might be very effectually applied without corporal indignity. (p. 108).
\f0 \

\f3 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sa120\partightenfactor0
\cf0 His therapeutic program meant paying attention to the environment in which the insane were confined. He changed the architecture, the diet, the way the nurses and orderlies treated the patients, everything.  He even went so far as to allow the higher-functioning patients to work as nurses for the lower-functioning. Patients were listened to. Careful, detailed personal histories were taken. Baths, walking and gardening were encouraged.
\f0 \

\f3 \
A lack of theoretical commitment meant that Pinel could borrow techniques from the many snake-oil salesmen and charlatans who populated Western Europe at the time. One of these fads happened to be mesmerism, now known as hypnosis. We\'92ll come back to the importance of mesmerism in the rise of psychoanalysis below.\
\
As a follower of Bacon, Pinel was only interested tabulating observations of results, and comparing them against the observations of the condition without intervention.  He insisted that we cannot cure a disease until we know of the progression of the disease *without* intervention.  In his own words, \'93We cannot cure diseases by the resources of art, if not previously acquainted with their terminations, when left to the unassisted efforts of nature.\'94 (p. 109). For him, extreme treatments could only be used in extreme cases. The curable would be cured by simple humane treatment.
\f0 \

\f3 \
It is worth pointing out that the word 'asylum' means, of course, a sanctuary or refuge. It *first* appears in English in the 1808 translation of Pinel's
\f4\i  *Treatise on Insanity*,
\f3\i0  to reference the Bic\'eatre
\f4\i .
\f3\i0  It appears in English newspapers starting in the 1860's, to describe leper colonies---long after Pinel's 'moral treatment' had come to dominate the English treatment of the mentally ill.

\f0\b0\fs24 \

\f6\b\fs28 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sa120\partightenfactor0

\f3\b0\fs24 \cf0 While Pinel tended to think of transient mental illness as a confusion of ideas, he occasionally spoke of the role of passions in mental illness.  In the early pages of the
\f4\i  Treatise
\f3\i0 , he hypotheses three different causes of insanity:
\f0 \

\f3 \
\pard\pardeftab720\li283\partightenfactor0
\cf0 >I now proceed to describe the general progress of periodical insanity. Among its various causes; exclusive of changes in the state of the atmosphere, my experience leads me to enumerate as the most frequent; undue indulgence of the angry passions; any circumstances calculated to suggest the recollection of the original exciting cause of the disease, intemperance in drinking, inanition, &c. [p. 12][#Pinel:1806ws]
\f0 \

\f3 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sa120\partightenfactor0
\cf0 Pinel's greatest student, Esquirol built on this hypothesis of 'undue indulgence of the angry passions' and redefined the notion of transient insanity as 'mental alienation.' It was Esquirol who grew the empirical understanding of the mind into a full-fledged psychiatric system. But like Pinel, the set of conditions he sought to explain were those with symptoms that were not obviously explained by physical, bodily conditions.
\f0 \

\f3 \
Esquirol split Pinel\'92s \'91Melancholia\'92 (see `\\fullref\{
\f7 table: pinel\}`\{=latex\}
\f3 , into \'91monomania,\'92 or obsession with a single idea, and 'lypemania.' The latter he renamed partially because the \'91melancholia\'92 implied the medieval theory of 'humors' and  'black bile,\'92 which Pinel specifically wanted to banish. 
\f0 \

\f3 \
Monomania, lypemania and mania were distinguished by the nature of the passions that are out of order: \'93The passions of the insane are impetuous, especially in mania and monomania. They are of a depressing character in lypemania. In dementia and imbecility, those only exist, which spring from the first wants of man,--love, anger, jealousy.\'94 [p 26][#Esquirol:1845ug]  
\f0 \

\f3 \
As the curable, transient forms of insanity were diseases of malformed passions, their treatment required reforming or redirecting the passions. His five varieties of insanity are defined thus:
\f0 \

\f3 \
\pard\pardeftab720\li709\fi-360\partightenfactor0
\ls2\ilvl0\cf0 1. Lypemania (melancholy of the ancients) delirium with respect to one, or a small number of objects, with predominance of a sorrowful and depressing passion.\
\pard\pardeftab720\li709\fi-360\partightenfactor0
\ls2\ilvl0
\f0 \cf0 \
\pard\pardeftab720\li709\fi-360\partightenfactor0
\ls2\ilvl0
\f3 \cf0 2. Monomania, in which the delirium is  limited to one or a small number of objects, with excitement, and predominance of a gay, and expansive passion.
\f0 \
\
3. 
\f3 Mania, in which the delirium extends to all kids of objects, and is accompanied by excitement.
\f0 \
\
4. 
\f3 Dementia, win which the insensate utter folly, because the organs of thought have lost their energy, and the strength requisite to fulfill their functions.
\f0 \
\
5. 
\f3 Imbecility, or idiocy, in which the conformation of the organs has never been such, that hose who are thus afflicted, could reason justly. [p. 29]
\f0 [#Esquirol:1845ug]\
\pard\tx560\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f3 \cf0 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sa120\partightenfactor0
\cf0 It is important to note here that the passions
\f4\i  *accompany*
\f3\i0  delirium with respect to collections of objects.  One cannot be passionate without being passionate about something. The 'something' that is the object of passion is supplied by the senses---and hence, we're still within a Lockean framework of understanding the mind.  
\f0 \

\f3 \
According to the Lockean framework, all ideas originate in sense experience or internal reflection. When the passions directed at one of these ideas becomes excessive and out of control, lypemania or monomania results, depending on the nature of the particular passion that becomes excessive. When the passions are exaggerated
\f4\i  without
\f3\i0  a specific object, and hence apply themselves to
\f4\i  every
\f3\i0  object, or what ever object is before the senses at a particular moment, we call that mania.
\f0 \

\f3 \
Mental illness's causes \'93are as numerous as its forms are varied.\'94  Case studies presented in his
\f4\i  Mental Maladies
\f3\i0  include climate, seasons, age, sex, temperament, trauma (especially during the first menstrual cycle for young women), excessive study, ambition, etc. Again, as in Pinel, the difference between the mentally ill and the mentally stable is one of scale, not of kind.  Everyone has passions---they are why we grieve, fall in love, work for that 'A', make personal sacrifices for our friends and families, etc.---the question of insanity is whether these passions are appropriate or excessive and whether they are directed at an appropriate or inappropriate object.
\f0 \

\f3 \
According to Esquirol:
\f0 \

\f3 \
\pard\pardeftab720\li283\partightenfactor0
\cf0 >\'93The first wants of man, limiting themselves to those connected with his preservation and reproduction, provoke the determinations of instinct; an internal impulse leads us to gratify them.
\f0 \

\f3 \
>The secondary wants, attach themselves to the first, and the desires which they excite, acquire as much more energy, as we have means of satisfying them, They produce the primitive passions; in fine, they are the wants which are connected with our preservation; and are the fruit of our increasing intelligence and civilization. They engender the factitious passions,\'97those passions which cause the greatest injury to man, especially in the higher walks of life.
\f0 \

\f3 \
>Infancy, except from the influence of the passions, is almost a stranger to insanity; but at the epoch of puberty, the sentiments, unknown until this period, cause new wants to arise. Insanity then appears, to trouble the first moments of the moral existence of man.
\f0 \

\f3 At mature age, the relations become extended, social wants multiple and the passions take a new character. In proportion as the amorous passions become enfeebled, those of a factitious nature grow strong. Personal interest, ambition, love of distinction and avarice, replace the charms of love and delights of paternity.
\f0 \

\f3 \
>At this period of life also, mental alienation appears; insanity is more obstinate, and more concentrated. It passes more readily into a chronic state; and is more dependent upon abdominal lesions.
\f0 \

\f3 \
>A sense of his weakness, renders the old man more clam; and while meditating upon the errors to which the passions lead, he isolates himself, and becomes an egotist.
\f0 \

\f3 \
>Insanity from a moral cause, rarely exists with him, and when he loses his reason, it is because his organs are fatigued and exhausted. Hence, it is neither mania nor monomania which is developed, at this period, but senile dementia.
\f0 \

\f3 \
>Of all moral causes, those which most frequently produce insanity, are pride, fear, fright, ambition, reverses of fortune, and domestic trouble. This last should have been placed, relative to its great influence, at the head of the moral causes, if it be limited to a simple ideas; but by domesticate troubles, I express all the pains, all the griefs, all oppositions, misfortunes and dissensions that grow out of the family state.

\cf0 Esquirol began to gather around himself a 'circle' of students who are sometimes referred to as the 'mental alienists.\'92 Two of the most famous of his students were Charles Las\'e8gue, who is now credited with working out the first definition of hysteria and first documenting
\f4\i  *anorexia nervosa*
\f3\i0 ; and \'c9tienne-Jean Georget who delineated four sub-types of 'monomania': theomania (religious obsession), ertomania (sexual obsession), demonomania (obsession with evil) and homocidal monomania.
\f0 \

\f3 \
Esquirol's concept of monomania sparked what is probably the first recorded wave of copy-cat psychosis. In November 1825, a young single mother of two named Henriette Cornier, decapitated the 19 month-old child of her neighbors. She had prepared her room for the act, even placing a bucket to catch the blood. She had known the family of the infant for only ten days, and had, up until this event, been nothing but loving and gentle towards the little girl who would be her victim. When the police arrived, she offered no resistance to the police, and did not flee. She confessed, saying that the idea had taken hold of her, and she simply had to act upon it.
\f0 \

\f3 \
The case became a sensation across Europe. Georget diagnosed her as a 'homicidal monomaniac.' At her trial, the jury decided that the act had
\f4\i  not
\f3\i0  been premediated and as a result, she was sentenced to life in prison with hard labor instead of death. This ruling makes little sense: Cornier admitted that the idea had occurred to her before the event, and she had carefully prepared her room for the murder. Thus, many commentators---include Lisa Appignanesi [p 75][#Appignanesi:2009vl]---have attributed the jury\'92s leniency to Georget's diagnosis of mental alienation. After all, if Cornier was mentally ill, does pre-planning count as 'premediation'?
\f0 \

\f3 \
The idea of the murderous monomaniac took off across Europe, informing or appearing in some of the greatest literature of era, including (according to various literary critics) Poe's \'93The Tell-Tale Heart,\'94 the character of Roskolvikov in Dostovesky's
\f4\i  *Crime and Punishment*
\f3\i0 , and even Heathcliff in Bonte's
\f4\i  *Wutherheights*.
\f3\i0  The Marquis de Sade is also said to have been a monomaniac.\

\f2\fs28 \cf0 Western medicine understood that the nervous system used, or conducted, electricity from the Galvani\'92s famous frog-leg experiments of 1780. There were, as one might expect, different interpretation of the relationship between nerves and electricity---Galvani believed electricity was the \'91vital force\'92 contained in living {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "scrivcmt://5F1E0393-990C-4587-862D-3F83C4912863"}}{\fldrslt things}}. Galvani\'92s colleague Volta, who went on to lend his name to the \'91Volt\'92, argued that the frog leg reacted to electricity, but did not contain it.\
The precise relationship between nerves and electricity, as well as the relationship between the nervous system an our psychology, was not nailed down for a long time. But that didn\'92t stop researchers in this era from speculating wildly. One of the most famous, whose theories about psychology are enshrined in our language in terms as frequent as \'91nervous\'92, is George Beard.\

\f3\b0\fs24 \cf0 George Beard (1839-1883) was an American physician who started out advocating for the use of electricity as a medical intervention.  His first book
\f4\i  *Medical Uses of Electricity*
\f3\i0  ([#Beard:1867tz]) suggested that electricity could be used to cure 'general nervous debility,' including dyspepsia, chorea, neuralgia, anaemia, or amenorrhoea. Beard was a charismatic popular author, who went on to write a series of popular home-healthcare books starting with
\f4\i  *Our Home Physician: Handy Book of Family Medicine*

Starting in the 1870s, Beard became increasingly interested in psychological disorders. In 1881, he published
\f4\i  *American Nervousness*
\f3\i0 , a book that came to define psychological treatment for a generation.  'Nervousness' did not mean then what it means today: jitteriness or tension. Then, it denoted a kind of fundamental exhaustion\'97what we still call a 'nervous breakdown'.  Technically, Beard defined it as:
\f0 \

\f3 \
\pard\pardeftab720\li283\partightenfactor0
\cf0 >\'93deficiency of lack of nerve-force. This condition, together with all the symptoms of diseases that are evolved from it, has developed mainly within the nineteenth century, and is especially frequent and severe in the Northern and Eastern portions of the United States. Nervousness, in the sense here used, is to be distinguished rigidly and systematically from simple excess of emotion and from organic disease.\'94 [p. vi][#Beard:1881tg]
\f0 \

\f3 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sa120\partightenfactor0
\cf0 It was caused by \'93modern civilization, which is distinguished from the ancient by these five characteristics: steam-power, the periodical press, the telegraph, the sciences, and the mental activity of women.\'94 (p. vi)
\f0 \

\f3 \
Beard was building on both folk theory of innate energy as well as recent discoveries in neurology (compare, for example, the concurrent theory of 'specific sense energies' proposed by  M\'fcller \'96 see the 
\f5\b `\\fullref\{birthofpsychology:germanphysiologicalpsychologyinthe1880s-1890s.\}`\{=latex\}.
\f3\b0 ). But he extended his view to cover diseases such as \'93neurasthenia (nervous exhaustion... hysteria, hay-fever, sick-headache, inebriety... some and phases of insanity.\'94 (p. vii) whose 'signs' could include:
\f0 \

\f3 \
>The nervous diathesis; susceptibility to stimulants and narcotics and various drugs, and consequent necessity of temperance; increase of the nervous diseases inebriety and neurasthenia (nervous exhaustion), hay-fever neuralgia, nervous dyspepsia, asthenopia and allied diseases and symptoms; early and rapid decay of teeth; premature baldness; sensitiveness to cold and heat; increase of diseases not exclusively nervous, as diabetes and certain forms of Bright's disease of the kidneys and chronic catarrhs; unprecedented beauty of American women; frequency of trance and muscle-reading; the strain of dentition, puberty and change of life; American oratory, humor speech and language; change in type of disease during the past half century, and the great intensity of animal life on this continent. (p. vii-ix)
\f0 \

\f3 \
Beard died shortly after the publication of
\f4\i  *American Nervousness*, 
\f3\i0 but his cause was taken up by Silas Wier Mitchell (1829-1914), who popularized a standard treatment for American Nervousness: the rest cure. As you can probably imagine, if the cause of American Nervousness was modern civilization, including women having a mental life, the cure was removal from modern civilization, including banning women from having a mental life.
\f0 \

\f3 \
In 1885, at the age of 25, Charlotte Perkins Gilman, a member of a prominent family of American progressives that included the abolitionist author Harriet Beecher Stowe, the suffragist Isabella Beecher Hooker, and the charismatic clergyman Henry Ward Beecher, gave birth to her only child Katharine Beecher Stetson. After the birth, Charlotte Perkins-Gilman experienced what we now recognize as a severe case of post-partum depression.
\f0 \

\f3 \
She was taken to see Silas Wier Mitchell. She described her experience of the treatment she received thus:
\f0 \

\f3 \
\pard\pardeftab720\li283\partightenfactor0
\cf0 >\'93During about the third year of this trouble I went, in devout faith and some faint stir of hope, to a noted specialist in nervous diseases, the best known in the country.  This wise man put me to bed and applied the rest-cure, to which all still-good physique responded so promptly that he concluded there was nothing much the matter with me, and sent me home with solemn advice to 'live as domestic a life as far as possible,' to 'have but two hours' intellectual life a day' and 'never touch a pen, brush or pencil again' as long as I lived. This was in 1887.\'94 (\'93Why I wrote

\cf0 Her experiences you may know from the American Standard short story
\f4\i  The Yellow Wallpaper
\f3\i0  (1892). Gilman acknowledged that she never suffered from the hallucinations her character does, but that she \'93came so near the borderline of mental ruin that I could see over.\'94 (1913)\

While Beard and Wier Mitchell are today often ridiculed as snake-oil salesmen playing on political concerns over rapid modernization and the suffragist movement, they made a number of notable contributions to our commonsense understanding of psychological disorder. First, they indelibly linked mental disorders to neurology. As mentioned above, we still use phrases like 'nervous breakdown' in common parlance to explain psychological disorder. Second, by proscribing puberty, birth, menopause and the 'unprecedented beauty of American women' as prime causes of mental illness, they further established a link between the onset and frustration of sexuality with mental illness, a point upon which Freud would build psychoanalysis.
\f0 \

\f3 \
It would be a mistake, however, to accept the simplistic narrative that the doctors of this era were manipulating and abusing their female patients without their consent. Historians of Psychology Laura C. Ball and Jennifer L. Bazar have recently demonstrated that in some cases, some women aggressive sought out procedures, such as clitorectomies, in this period. In one remarkable case, a patient even 'tormented the doctors to operate again.' [#Ball:2010tk]
\f0 \

\f3 \
One way to chart the rise of psychiatric diagnosis is to consider how people with mental illness are counted.  Starting in 1830, the US census included categories for the disabled, including 'blind' and 'deaf.' [#Gorwitz:1974tt] From 1840-1870, the census included the category 'idiocy/insanity.' Starting in 1880, however, the federal government began using categories of mental illness. In 1880, those categories were:

\cf0 \
Charcot is, today, often classified as a neurologist. That is a bit of historicism, as there was no such field when he began work.  In fact, the 'neuron doctrine', or the idea that the nervous system is composed of individual cells called 'neurons,' is not formally advanced until 1891. And it isn't until 1911 that Ramon y Cajal uses the Golgi stain to highlight neurons in the hippocampus, confirming the neuron doctrine.
\f0 \

\f3 \
None of that stopped Charcot from classifying a huge number conditions and diseases we still recognize today: multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS or \'93Lou Gerig's disease,\'94 it was once called \'93Charcot's disease\'94), lenticulostriate artery (\'93Charcot's artery\'94), joint arthopathy (\'93Charcot's joint\'94), peroneal muscular atrophy (\'93Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease\'94), Charcot Wilbrand syndrome, Charcot's intermittent hepatic fever and even Parkinson's disease were all first named or described by Charcot.
\f0 \

\f3 \
Methodologically, Charcot advocated what he called the 'anatomo-clinical' method, which meant careful anatomical analysis performed largely post-mortum combined with case studies of vivisection in both animals and human subjects. Once a behavioral deficiency has been identified, careful anatomical studies are carried out to determine any corresponding anatomical 'deficiency,' or lesion. In his own words:
\f0 \

\f3 \
\pard\pardeftab720\li283\partightenfactor0
\cf0 >Allow me to recall to your minds the opinion which that most illustrious physiologist, Claude Bernard, thus expressed:\'97\'93Pathology,\'94 said he, \'93should not he subordinated to physiology. Quite the reverse. Set up first the medical problem which arises from the observation of a malady, and afterwards seek for a physiological explanation. To act otherwise would be to risk overlooking the patient, and distorting the malady.\'94 These are excellent words, which I have ventured to quote verbatim, because they are absolutely significant. They enable us to clearly understand that the whole domain of pathology appertains strictly to the physician, who alone can cultivate it and make it fruitful, and that it necessarily remains closed to the physiologist who, systematically confined within the precincts of his laboratory, disdains the teaching of the hospital ward. (p. 8)
\f0 \

\f3 \
\
\pard\pardeftab720\sa120\partightenfactor0
\cf0 In 1878, he began extensive work on hypnosis. Hypnosis had been practiced at the Salp\'eatri\'e8re for over 50 years--since the days of Pinel, in fact. Charcot became increasingly interested in the therapeutic use of hypnosis to cure what he called 'hysteria', a vaguely-defined collection of usually transient symptoms that included paralysis, anesthesias, visual or auditory agnosias, temporary blindness or deafness, amnesia and seizures. While 'hysteria' came to be identified closely with women, Charcot himself believed that it could effect men, and treated many men that he diagnosed with hysteria.
\f0 \

\f3 \
This does not mean, however, that Charcot gave up his commitment to neurological explanations of behavior. He simply allowed functional and/or physiological explanations in addition to the anatomical. In his words:
\f0 \

\f3 \
\pard\pardeftab720\li283\partightenfactor0
\cf0 > There is another important fact in the history of neuroses in general, and of hysteria in particular, which clearly shows that these diseases do not form, in pathology, a class apart, governed by other physiological laws than the common ones. (13)
\f0 \

\f3 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sa120\partightenfactor0
\cf0 I've quoted this passage because it is the first use of the word 'neuroses' in print.  It's root in neurological terminology is obvious, but here Charcot uses it to demarcate transient, psychological, functional or dynamic neurological conditions from the incurable, intransient, anatomical neurological conditions. The former we classify as \'91mental\'92, the latter \'91neurological\'92---even today. 'Neurosis' thus supplants 'mental alienation' and 'nervousness' as the descriptor of the set of psychological conditions that cannot be explained physically, even though it\'92s root is connected to the idea of a physical manifestation in \'91neurons.\'92
\f0 \

\f3 \
In 1890, blocked by antisemitism in Germany from further education, a young Sigmund Freud came to study with M. Charcot. There, he learned the techniques of hypnosis and studied many cases of hysteria. Later in life, Freud frequently referred to Charcot as his 'mentor,' and even attributed the idea that all neuroses originate 'in the genitals' to {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "scrivcmt://86B581A0-8F91-4C09-9C9B-46E524C4FAC4"}}{\fldrslt Charcot.}}
\f0 \

\f3 \
In his eulogy for Charcot, Sigmund Freud said:
\f0 \

\f3 \
\pard\pardeftab720\li283\partightenfactor0
\cf0 >He was not a reflective man, not a thinker: He had the nature of an artist\'97he was, as he himself said, a 'visuel', a man who sees... He used to look again and again at the things he did not understand, to deepen his impression of them day by day, till suddenly an understanding of them dawned on him.  In his mind's eye the apparent chaos presented by the continual repetition of the same symptoms then ave way to order: the new nosological picture emerged, characterized by the constant combination of certain groups of symptoms... He might be heard to say that the greatest satisfaction a man could have was to see something new-- that is, to recognize it as new; and he remarked against and again n the difficulty and value of this kind of 'seeing'. (Quoted in Mad, Bad and Sad, p. 128)
\f0 \

\f3 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sa120\partightenfactor0
\cf0 It should be fairly obvious that Freud here is dismissing, essentially, Charcot's Baconian approach to scientific classification: careful, close observation with only careful, conservative theoretical suppositions. Unlike Charcot, who is remembered only in the names of the diseases he classified, Freud became globally famous for his theoretical suppositions. Whereas Charcot was content with describing neuroses and localizing them in the nervous system, Freud sought to explain the origins of neuroses in non-physical terms.

\f0\b0\fs24 \

\f6\b\fs28 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sa120\partightenfactor0

\f3\b0\fs24 \cf0 By the end of the 19\super th\nosupersub  century, we are beginning to find general agreement that mental illnesses are characterized by symptoms with no bodily, physical (or in Beard's terms 'organic') {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "scrivcmt://B6D1ABC3-7A81-4A92-90B3-61B5014EB147"}}{\fldrslt explanation.}} That understanding defined the limits of psychiatry. When a condition could be explained in anatomical terms, it was no longer considered psychiatric and reverted to medical or neurological. When it could not be understood physically---when it had to be explained in terms of 'psychic energy---it was given to the psychiatrists.
\f0 \

\f3 \
This thesis was not challenged largely because psychiatrists practiced in hospitals that contained psychiatric patients. That sounds circular, but it isn't: Pinel, Esquirol and Charcot were attempting to create a theory of mental illness that could explain the patients they saw before them. The patients they saw before them were not brought there because they fit the theory, or because they had chosen to be there. They were brought to the Bic\'eatre and Salp\'eatri\'e8re when the rest of the medical community had given up attempting to explain their symptoms.\

\f0 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f3 \cf0 \
The same can be said for Beard and Wier Mitchell: Perkins Gilman was taken to see Wier Mitchell only after all physical interventions had failed.
\f0 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sa120\partightenfactor0

\f3 \cf0 \
These founders of psychiatry theorized about a population that had been deemed mentally ill
\f4\i  *because the medical community had given up explaining their symptoms*
\f3\i0 . Not the other way around. The Psychiatric hospital was a kind of catch-all for those individuals whose symptoms could not be alleviated by physical medicine, and hence it is unsurprising that the definitions of insanity we find in this era require the absence of a physical explanation.\
\
Without a control population, there was no way these classifications could tease apart underlying conditions from any effects that may have resulted from being classified this way in the first place. 
\f0 \

\f3 \
In 1880, Josef Breuer, a student of the great psycho-physiologist Ewald Hering, was studying the ear as a part of his research at Vienna General Hospital. It was there that he first met 'Anna O.', a young woman with an extremely acute cough. Finding **no physical reason** for the cough, her family physician diagnosed her with \'93typical
\f4\i  *tussis nurvosa*
\f3\i0  [nervous cough]\'94 [p 27][#Freud:kVwxqGOZ] 
\f0 \

\f3 \
 Shortly thereafter a number of other symptoms arose. Freud & Breuer describe her case thusly:
\f0 \

\f3 \
\pard\pardeftab720\li283\partightenfactor0
\cf0 >  Before this time she too had always enjoyed good health, showing no sign of nervous indisposition during her development. Of considerable intelligence, remarkably acute powers of reasoning, and a clear-sighted intuitive sense, her powerful mind could have digested, needed even, more substantial intellectual nourishment, but failed to receive it once she had left school. Her rich poetic and imaginative gifts were controlled by a very sharp and critical common sense. The latter also made her quite closed to suggestion. Only arguments had any influence on her, assertions were without effect. Her will was energetic, tenacious and persistent, sometimes heightened to such obstinacy that it would give way only out of kindness and consideration for others.
\f0 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0
\cf0 \
\pard\pardeftab720\li283\partightenfactor0

\f3 \cf0 > One of her principle traits was a sympathetic kindness. Even during her illness, she benefited greatly from the care and support she gave to some sick and poor people, for it allowed her to satisfy a strong drive. Her spirits always tended slightly to exaggeration, whether of joyfulness or grief, and as a consequence she was also somewhat moody. The element of sexuality was remarkably undeveloped: the patient, whose life became transparent to me in a way that seldom happens between people, had never been in love, and not once in the mass of hallucinations that occurred during her illness did this element of the inner life emerge...
\f0 \

\f3 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0
\cf0 >...The course of the illness falls into several distinct phases. They are as follows:
\f0 \
\
\pard\tx720\pardeftab720\li720\fi-360\partightenfactor0

\f3 \cf0 > A)	Latent incubation. From mid-July 1880 to approximately 10 December. This  case was exceptional because it afforded so complete an insight into a phase that in most cases escapes us, and for this reason alone its pathological interest could not be overestimated. I will expound on this part of the history later.
\f0 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0
\cf0 \
\pard\tx720\pardeftab720\li720\fi-360\partightenfactor0

\f3 \cf0 > B)	Manifest illness: a peculiar kind of psychosis, paraphasia,
\f4\i  *stabismus convergens*
\f3\i0  [convergent squint], sever visual disturbance, paralyzing contractures, complete paralysis in the upper right and both lower extremities, partial paralysis in the upper left extremity, paresis of the neck muscles. A gradual reduction in the contracture of the right extremities. Some improvement, interrupted by a sever psychical trauma (death of the father) in April, after which
\f0 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0
\cf0 \
\pard\tx720\pardeftab720\li720\fi-360\partightenfactor0

\f3 \cf0 > C)	A period of continual somnambulism ensues, which then alternates with more normal states; continuation of a series of chronic symptoms until December 1881.
\f0 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0
\cf0 \
\pard\tx720\pardeftab720\li720\fi-360\partightenfactor0

\f3 \cf0 > D)	Gradual winding down of mental states and symptoms until June 1882. [p25-26][#Freud:kVwxqGOZ]
\f0 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sa120\partightenfactor0

\f3 \cf0 \
Breuer took over her care during the period of 'manifest illness,'  during which, Anna O. slept for great periods of time ('somnambulism'), but when she awoke in the evening, she would complain of 'torment.' Her speech lost all grammatical structure ('paraphasia') and she would piece together words and phrases from the five distinct languages she spoke, producing an incomprehensible jargon. This same jargon appeared in writing, so Breuer knew that it was not a disfunction of the physical mechanism of speech.
\f0 \

\f3 \
In the early spring of 1881, Anna O fell mute for a period of two weeks. At this point, Breuer claims that he 
\f0 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f3 \cf0 \
>\'93knew she had taken great offense at something and had resolved to say nothing about it. When I guessed as much and forced her to talk about it, the inhibition, which had until then made it impossible for her to speak about anything else either, disappeared.\'94 [p 29][#Freud:kVwxqGOZ]
\f0 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sa120\partightenfactor0

\f3 \cf0 \
After her father's death, her illness became much more severe. Breuer noticed, however, that her periods of sleep in the later afternoon, during which she was 'tormented' by hallucinations, resembled hypnotic states.  He decided to preemptively hypnotize her and prompt her to 'talk through' these tormenting phantasies. The symptoms subsided quickly.  The day after a session, she would become 'quite calm' and 'agreeable, obedient, industrious and even in good spirits'. The second day after a session she would be 'increasingly moody, contrary and disagreeable, and this worsened on the third.'  Anna O. named these sessions (in English) the '
\f4\i talking cure
\f3\i0 ' and '
\f4\i chimney-sweeping.
\f3\i0 '  Breuer preferred the more sophisticated 'cathartic procedure.'
\f0 \

\f3 \
Breuer communicated this to his friend Sigmund Freud, who offered to co-author a paper laying out the findings. That paper, titled 'The Psychic Mechanism of Hysterical Phenomena,' first appeared in 1893, but was republished as the first chapter of Freud and Breuer's
\f4\i  *Studies on Hysteria
\f3\i0 * [1895][#Freud:kVwxqGOZ]. In it, Freud and Breuer propose a new form of hysteria, called 'traumatic hysteria', which they conjecture is always connected to some traumatic event that evokes the syndrome. They further hypothesize that the traumatic event can be unavailable to the conscious, reflective mind of patient---i.e. be unconscious---yet still be causally responsible for the hysterical symptoms.  Moreover, they hypothesize that making the patient aware of the trauma, via Breuer\'92s 'cathartic procedure' using hypnosis if necessary, alleviates the hysteria.

\f0\b0\fs24 \

\f6\b\fs28 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sa120\partightenfactor0

\f3\b0\fs24 \cf0 The seeds of psychoanalysis were planted by Charcot and Breuer, but they did not develop into a full-fledged system of Psychiatry until Freud worked independently. Building on his theory of unconscious trauma to explain hysteria, Freud hypothesizes that traumatic events may manifest themselves in the mind indirectly in the form of symbols. He then went on to realize that the fantasy lives of the psychotic are full of such symbols, and recovering the original trauma requires investigation of the mechanisms of symbolization.
\f0 \

\f3 \
It was this realization that gives us the basis for psychoanalysis, for it is this realization that allows Freud to argue that the hallucinations and fantasies experiences by the psychotic are not significantly different from the dreams of the sane. Whereas prior to Freud, dreams and hallucinations were thought to be without meaning, after Freud they were seen as full of symbolic representations, the meanings of which were available empirically through systematic investigation of the mechanisms of psychological representation. Freud's proposed mechanisms are introduced in the `\\ref\{classical\}`\{=latex\} section on page `\\pageref\{classical\}`\{=latex\} of the game book.
\f0 \

\f3 \
\pard\pardeftab720\li283\fi-283\partightenfactor0

\fs20 \cf0 The barrier between the mentally ill and the mentally healthy had been permanently {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "scrivcmt://551ED570-7740-4CDB-AC3D-1F943D330AA2"}}{\fldrslt broken.}} No longer does the theory of psychiatry apply
\f4\i  only
\f3\i0  to those who cannot be helped by medicine. Now the theory applies to everyone: a healthy person could become ill through unhealthy habits of mental representation, and ill people could become healthy through the process of discovering their habits of mental representation and recognizing their unconscious traumas.  
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sa120\partightenfactor0

\fs24 \cf0 This conflation of psychiatric conditions and normal life left Freud in the precarious position of having to define 'mental illness.'  He did so thus:\

\f0 `\\begin\{apatextbox\}\{Freud\'92s Definition of Mental Illness\}`\{=latex\}
\f3  Symptoms\'97and of course we are dealing now with psychical (or psychogenic) symptoms and psychical illness\'97are acts detrimental, or at least useless, to the subject's life as a whole, often complained by him as unwelcome and bringing unpleasure or suffering to him.

\
**Neurosis v. Psychosis.**
\f3\b0  One of the hallmarks of Freud's theory is his thesis that the there is no hard and fast distinction to be made between the mentally ill and the mentally healthy. His
\f4\i  *Introductory Lectures*
\f3\i0  are structured to introduce the reader to psychopathology in everyday life before extending the analysis of common activities to psychotics and neurotic patients.  As such, there are no hard and fast definitions of psychosis and {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "scrivcmt://F0BB25C8-8EC9-4E6D-83C9-91D388322FA7"}}{\fldrslt neurosis}}.
\f0 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sa120\partightenfactor0

\f3 \cf0 \
During the course of normal development of mentally healthy adults, the ego must become 'reasonable': it must no longer let \'93itself be governed by the pleasure principle, but obeys the
\f4\i  reality principle
\f3\i0 , which also at bottom seeks to obtain pleasure, but pleasure which is assured through taking account of reality, even though it is pleasure postponed and diminished.\'94 (p. 444) A neurotic's ego fails to make this transition, and gets stuck at one point in development.  Thus, the neurotic's libido and ego are still struggling in a child-like way, but the contents of the struggle have been transformed into objects of adulthood. Neurotic symptoms are the \'93outcome of a conflict which arises over a new method of satisfying the libido\'94 (p. 446) and a person is ill from neurosis only if \'93his ego has lost the capacity to allocate his libido in some way\'94 (p. 480). A psychotic patient, however, has lost the battle for the reality principle, and the libido has created its own reality.
\f0 \

\f3 \
The object of a neurosis, then, is relevant to the diagnosis only insofar as it is a stand-in for the actual conflict by the mechanisms of repression, reaction formation, isolation, etc.  According to Freud: \'93clinical psychiatry takes little notice of the outward form or content of individual symptoms, but psychoanalysis takes matters up at precisely that point and has established in the first place the fact that symptoms have a sense and are related to the patient's experience.\'94 (p. 318)

\pard\pardeftab720\li283\fi-283\partightenfactor0

\f3\b0\fs20 \cf0 In 1909, G. Stanley Hall, first president of the American Psychological Association, invited Freud and Jung to give a series of lectures at Clark University. The conference itself was a major moment in the intellectual history of America, as such luminaries as William James, Franz Boas, Adolf Meyer and E.B. Tichner were in attendance, as well as the famed Anarchist Emma {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "scrivcmt://0DED8E03-915A-4ADB-80F9-D6240FF999D5"}}{\fldrslt Goldman.}}
\f0\fs24 \

\f3\fs20 \
After the lectures, James Jackson Putnam, a neurologist in New York City, invited Freud and Jung to retire to his family's Adirondack 'great camp' for the weekend. ([#Prochnik:FiwLnN1z])  Putnam became an important advocate for psychoanalysis in the United States, establishing its legitimacy as a treatment for hysteria. While there are articles prior to 1909 on psychoanalysis (notably one by Putnam himself in 1906), we don't find significant discussion of  psychoanalysis in the mainstream journals of Psychology until after the Clark {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "scrivcmt://A29F6E0F-2D7D-4566-B3A4-AAF5205F1F79"}}{\fldrslt lectures.}} An effort to convince the American public of the scientific nature of psychoanalysis was mounted by Putnam camp attendees A.A. Brill, founder of the New York Psychoanalytic Society, and Ernest Jones, student of Freud. By 1916, Jones had published 20 articles, notes and reviews in the Journal of Abnormal Psychology offering or advocating for {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "scrivcmt://2ABA0FFE-2993-47FD-9A8A-271C08196742"}}{\fldrslt psychoanalysis.}}
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sa120\partightenfactor0

\f3 \cf0 \
Putnam and Freud went on to become close friends, and Putnam spent much of the rest of his career attempting to professionalize and regularize the practice of psychiatry. He founded the American Psychoanalytic Association (APsaA) in 1911, which is still active today. His posthumously published
\f4\i  *Addresses on Psychoanalysis*
\f3\i0 , which contains a preface by Freud himself, not only seeks to introduce Freudian theory to his scientific community, but also to dispel misunderstanding gained \'93through the gossip of prejudice and misconception\'94 [p. 3][#Putnam:1921uc].
\f0 \

\f3 \
Putnam\'92s influence here cannot be understated. Putnam introduced psychoanalytic ideas to the budding field of medical neurology. His position as a medical doctor at Harvard gave psychoanalysis legitimacy as a medical practice in America, and his stature in the neurological community helped to assuage any doubts about the lack of a physical basis for the hypothetical entities posited by Freud's structural hypothesis.
\f0 \

\f3 \
The story is not all smooth sailing. In 1916, the Princeton philosopher and psychologist Warren Fite reviewed of Jung's
\f4\i  *Psychology of the Unconscious*
\f3\i0  for
\f4\i  *The Nation*,
\f3\i0  writing that it \'93\cf17 presents some five hundred-odd pages of incoherence and obscenity in the form of a psycho-analytic interpretation of the experiences of a sentimental young American woman\cf0 .\'94 [#Fite:1916tk] The fact that the United States was at war with Germany didn't help the psychoanalytic cause: Christine Ladd-Franklin, a student of C.S. Peirce and protege of no less than Hermann Helmholtz as well as one of the first women in the APA, called Freud's theory the product of an \'93undeveloped... German mind.\'94
\f0 \

\f3 \
What followed is a history of tension between those in the psychological and psychoanalytic communities. Helped by the military's preference for psychoanalysts in the treatment of 'shell-shock' during WWI and 'combat fatigue' in WWII, psychoanalysis gained credibility in the eyes of the American {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "scrivcmt://424E8B36-AF81-4F6E-9EB0-FE70664FCA52"}}{\fldrslt public.}}

\f3\i0 \cf0 In 1928, the New York Academy of Medicine invited the Public Health Service, the Army and Navy Medical Departments and the American Hospital Association to collaborate on a standard nomenclature of disease. That standard was first published in 1933 as
\f4\i  *A Standard Classified Nomenclature of Disease*
\f3\i0 , generally referred to as
\f4\i  *The Standard*
\f3\i0 , and was widely used until at least the 1960s. [#Houts:2000vp]\
\
 In its original form, it used the following ten categories, as displayed in table `\\ref\{table: 1933Classification\}`\{=latex\}:\

\f3\i0 \cf0 You may notice that the medical classification is entirely based on the origin or cause of a condition ('Diseases **due to...**\'92), not the symptoms. In the `\\ref\{table: 1918Classification\}`\{=latex\}, classification system, mental diseases are classified by the Freudian terms 'psychosis' and 'neurosis', except for melancholy and dimentia.
\f0 \

\f3 \
During WWII, psychiatrists classified patients according to the standards of the branch of the armed forces for which they worked. In 1943, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brigadier_General_(United_States)"}}{\fldrslt Brigadier General}} William C. Menninger issued a bulletin called \'93Medical 203\'94 that laid the foundations for medical classification of mental illness. The Navy, Army and Veterans affairs branches all used slightly different diagnostic criteria and classifications.
\f0 \

\f3 \
The International Statistical Classification of Diseases (ICD) included a taxonomy of mental disorders for the first time in 1949. Its classification system is displayed in table `\\ref\{

\f3\i0 \cf0 In the interest of unifying these different classification schema, the American Psychiatric Association voted to create the first Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM). The nomenclature committee adapted the Medical 203 bulletin into the DSM and circulated it to a randomly selected sample of the membership (10%). When it was overwhelmingly approved by those who replied, the APA adopted it as the standard for diagnosis in medical treatment of psychological disorders. It is included as Appendix `\\ref\{app: DSMI\}`\{=latex\}\
The first DSM distinguished between \'93Disorders caused by or associated with impairment of brain tissue function,\'94 \'93Mental Deficiency,\'94  \'93Disorders of psychogenic origin or without clearly defined physical cause or structural change in the brain\'94 and \'93Nondiagnostic Terms for Hospital Record.\'94  This fourth category included \'93Alcoholic intoxication (simple drunkenness),\'94 and \'93Dead on admission.\'94  It is the third category, those without a physical cause, that is of the most interest to us. They are displayed here in table `\\ref\{

\f3\b0\fs24 \cf0 Because psychoanalysis tended to be confined to clinical, military settings in the US, a kind of stable truce\'97the more cynical might even say a 'cold war\'92---settled over the conflict between behaviorism and psychoanalysis. By and large, psychoanalysis confined itself to the medical setting; while behaviorism confined itself to pure research. There were, no doubt, volleys across the bow of one or the other from time to time. But until Skinner's wide-ranging proposals for behaviorism as social reformation, there were few open hostilities.
\f0 \

\f3 \
Much of the scientific credibility for psychoanalysis turned on its success in treating psychotic patients.  Medical Doctors tend not to worry so much about the putative mechanism of a therapy, so long as that therapy works for the individual patient in question.  It isn't uncommon for a drug to help some small portion of the population and fail with another.  Generalizations to universal laws are uncommon in the practice of medicine, and much the of time the cause of a certain medical condition remains unknown, even if we understand how to cure it (consider cancers like lymphoma, for example). Thus, when psychologists objected that psychoanalysis did not generalize, its mechanisms were untestable, and as a treatment it was highly individualistic, medical practitioners were not overly impressed.  
\f0 \

\f3 \
All of that changed starting in 1955 when Wallace Labs began marketing the world's first popular psychotropic for the treatment of anxiety: *Miltown*. The Wallace Lab claimed that *Miltown* controlled anxiety without reducing mental function, allowing patients to return to their normal lives. It was quickly followed by *Trofranil*, an antidepressant, in 1959; *Librium*, an anti-anxiety medication, in 1960; and *Valium* in 1963. In 1969, the neurologist Oliver Sacks administered a new drug L-DOPA to patients who had been comatose for almost 40 years. They woke up.  His experiences were immortalized in the book and subsequent movie,

\f3\b0\fs24 \cf0 In 1961, Thomas Langer and Stanley Michael conducted 2-hour interviews with 1,660 individuals chose at random from the streets of New York. This was, in many ways, the first wide-scale study of the psychology of people *not already* seeking treatment for psychological trouble.  Their findings are quite simple: socio-economic status and age explain most of an individual's mental health. \
\
 The study was revolutionary. As S. H. Kranes of the University of Chicago said "[this study] is a pioneer in obtaining 'objective' information.  Psychiatry is too promote to the philosophical other than the factual." [#Kraines:1964fy]

\f3\b0\fs24 \cf0 Since the origin of psychiatry, there has been a distinction made between those disorders that can be directly attributable to a biological dysfunction of the brain and those that cannot. The former were classified as 'neurological,' and the latter 'psychiatric.'  It is this inability to find a biological etiology of the disorder defines the domain of psychiatry.
\f0 \

\f3 \
Two major trends are appearing in psychology and psychiatry: 
\f0 \

\f3 \
1. The current psychoanalytic taxonomy of mental states is based on conjectures and assumptions based on a few case studies, and they have not been tested against evidence and observation.
\f0 \

\f3 \
2. Psychiatric disorders must have a physical component, and hence, the line between psychiatry and neurology may be breaking down.
\f0 \

\f3 \
In light of these trends, what will happen to the field of psychiatry?
