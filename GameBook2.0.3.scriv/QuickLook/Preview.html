<p class="binderItem"><strong>Brief overview of the game</strong><br/>## Introducing The Game<br/>
<br/>
This game highlights the intellectual conflicts that changed American psychiatry and psychology in the early part of the 1970s.<br/>
<br/>
 It might seem a little odd, in a Reacting game, to be exploring relatively recent events. While there will be no executions, ostracisms or civil wars in this game, the intellectual stakes are no less high. What you know of Psychiatry and Psychology today---the social significance of the American Psychiatric Association’s *Diagnostic and Statis...</p>

Your cab pulls up in front of the Shoreham hotel  in Rock Creek Park, a particularly tranquil part of the chaos that is Washington D.C. You nervously check the entrance to the hotel. It's clear. This year, there are no throngs of protesters bent on face-to-face confrontation.<br/>
<br/>
They must be down at the mall participating in the massive protest calling for an end to the Vietnam war.  The radio reported an estimated crowd of at least 50,000. And that's before the 10,000 National Guard...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Counterfactuals</strong><br/>### Counterfactuals<br/>
<br/>
In reality there are two distinct associations named 'APA.' The American Psychiatric Association, which is composed of Medical Doctors who practice Psychiatry, maintains the DSM. The American Psychological Association, which is composed of academics (PhDs) who study the mind in a variety of ways, does not. <br/>
<br/>
In this game, I have conflated the two, which is significant transgression according to both sides of the divide. <br/>

### Brief history of the concept of 'Psychology'<br/>
<br/>
Psychology is probably the youngest of commonly accepted academic disciplines---the first PhD in Psychology was earned by G. Stanley Hall in 1878. But we'll get to that. First, we have to go back to the notion of science itself.<br/>
<br/>
#### Pre-history of Psychology: Empiricism about the Mind<br/>

### Brief History of the Study of Homosexuality in America<br/>
<br/>
While homosexual behavior has appeared throughout human history, the notion of homosexuality as an “orientation” or “personality” is relatively recent.  The etymology of the word 'homosexual' itself shows the intimate connection between the idea of sexual orientation and the history of psychiatry.  According to the OED, the term first appears in print in English in C. G. Chaddock translation of R. von Krafft-Ebing 1892 *Psychopathia Se...</p>

### Brief History of “mental illness”<br/>

What makes a certain condition a ‘mental’ condition or a 'medical' or ’neurological’ condition?  Suppose you are a family doctor, and a patient presents with an unwelcome and unwanted problem---a twitch, perhaps. Do you call a psychiatrist or a neurologist? How do you know?<br/>
<br/>
While behaviors associated with mental illness---hallucinations, catatonic states, mania, etc.---have been known since ancient times, psychiatry dates its regularization as a scientifi...</p>

### Major Issues in the Game<br/>
<br/>
All psychological theories hold that human action can be described, understood, predicted and controlled based on previous actions or mental processes of that human.  The way to make those predictions---and the underlying mechanisms posited that explain those actions---separates psychological theories from each other.<br/>
<br/>
When I say ‘mechanism’, I am using a very specific notion in the Philosophy of science.  A mechanism is an organization of underlying e...</p>

### Basic game play<br/>
<br/>
Each week (two or three sessions, depending on your schedule) of game play reenacts one annual conference of the APA in the early 1970s. The five weeks of game play cover the years 1971-1975. In reality, these conferences are huge events. There are presentations on current research, symposia on issues facing the discipline, administrative meetings for various committees, public discussions and votes on proclamations, and publishers promoting their products. In game play, pl...</p>

Academic associations like the APA not only provide their members with a forum through which they can socialize, share ideas and test or their most recent work; they also represent their discipline to the public. An association's President is often called upon to act as a spokesperson during times of controversy. And the associations often define---sometimes very carefully---the qualifications someone must have to become a member.<br/>

Elections can be confusing to students initially, but it usually resolves after the first conference.  They do tend to take on the character of any academic election: a bunch of people sitting around saying ‘not it’.  I’ve required *every* member of the APA to hold a position at some point during the game, so that will motivate most students.

1. *Internal entities are neither the object of scientific study nor explanatorily relevant to psychology.* Behaviorism begins with the deceptively simply insight that while psychoanalytic explanations are framed in terms of psychic entities (ego, id, etc.), quantities (psychic energy) and interactions (the mechanisms of repression), w...</p>

But they disagree that the explanations of behavior must necessarily be in terms of observable macro-objects like organisms and environments.  Cognitivists see the mind/brain as an informati...</p>

As you may remember from <!--\fullref{pre-historyofpsychology:empiricismaboutthemind}-->, we attribute the birth of the scientific method to Francis Bacon.

Fechner’s law was one of the first great successes of this era, as for the first time, it related a physical phenomenon to a psychological one with the precision of mathematics. <br/>

###### The hypothetico-deductive method<br/>
Some have characterized the testing of hypotheses in science as a two-step process. The first step of the argument involves the deduction of a prediction from the hypothesis to be tested. Then, after we see whether the prediction turns out to be true, we can draw conclusions about the truth of the hypothesis. If the prediction turns out to be true, the hypothesis has been confirmed. The argument might run roughly as follows:<br/>

One way to explain why something happens is to demonstrate a cause for it. But causes typically do not operate in isolation. Encountering a virus may explain why you developed the flu, but the condition of having the flu only arises when a number of other things happen. In particular, a virus must invade a particular cell (flu viruses invade cells lining a person’s respiratory or digestive track). <br/>

The narrative of the game begins, but *does not end with*, the demedicalization of homosexuality. This game is not intended to be a political game wherein the players are centrally interested in the collection and use of power.  Rather, this game is meant to be about evidence, and the interpretation of evidence. Bieber claims, for example, to have about 30% success rate in his ‘treatment’ of homosexuality. Is this an adequate ‘success’ rate given the struggles the other 70% of...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Overview</strong><br/>### Overview<br/>
 <br/>
While there is a great deal to prepare for this game, my experience has taught me that the largest challenge the students will face is understanding that psychology and psychiatry were not always as they are now presented.  <br/>
<br/>
Most students come to the game believing that (a) psychology is a science and (b) psychiatry is a medical practice.  Neither of those claims were settled in the public mind in 1970.  In fact, most of the tension in this game revolves around the efforts to mak...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Rules and Procedures</strong><br/>### Rules and Procedures<br/>
<br/>
Generally speaking, our students come to psychology and psychiatry through textbooks. And as a result, they are primed to believe, unreflectively, that contemporary narrative of these disciplines is settled fact. Furthermore, these students know nothing of the rise and regularization of health insurance companies and billing procedures following the inception of Medicare and Medicaid in 1965. For them, managed care, billable hours and check-box diagnoses have always bee...</p>

Getting the committees to function well can be challenging---in the game as in real life.

#### Learning Objectives<br/>
<br/>
In many ways, this is not a game about Psychology or Psychiatry, it is a game about the Philosophy of Science. This shouldn't really be surprising, as the history of the Psychology and Psychiatry is intimately linked to the history of the Philosophy of Science.

Many of the issues raised in the course of the game are appropriately philosophical.  While we've instructed the students to focus on the evidence, and its relationship with the claims asserted, one is often forced to notice how few of the great conflicts in the history of psychology and psychiatry are actually about the quality of the evidence presented. The conflicts are, most frequently, actually about whether the evidence in question can be considered 'scient...</p>

Many psychologists--Freud included--have held, with little evidence in support, that the human mind is built on a variety of instincts, such as self-preservation, sexual activity, etc. Emotional responses to fearful stimuli, such as rats and spiders, is commonly considered to be innate, possibly as a result of evolutionary pressures to avoid infectious or poisonous creatures.  This experiment seeks to condition a fea...</p>

Mentally rotating 3-dimensional objects is one indicator of spatial reasoning in humans. And it is one that is tempting to explain in terms of internal mental imagery.

I've left the issue of membership in the APA, and the right to vote on many of the main issues, intentionally vague. This is to allow for some flexibility for the instructor. The issue of who can practice mental health treatment is a game issue, realized in competing proposals in 1973.  As a corollary then, the issue of membership in the APA may be brought forward. This can also play out as one of the causes of the APA’s ‘fission' that may occur starting in 1975.<br/>
