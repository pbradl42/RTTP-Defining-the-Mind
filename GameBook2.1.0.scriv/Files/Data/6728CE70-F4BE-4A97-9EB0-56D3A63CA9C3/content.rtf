Charcot saw himself primarily as a nosologist: a classifier or taxonomizer of disease, rather than a healer. His appointment was, in many ways, ideal. This was a patient population for which there was no hope of cure, and morever, had not been studied in a careful way.  \

Charcot is, today, often classified as a neurologist. That is a bit of historicism, as there was no such field when he began work.  In fact, the `\\index[gamebook]\{neuron doctrine\}`\{=latex\}\'92neuron doctrine', or the idea that the nervous system is composed of individual cells called 'neurons,' is not formally advanced until 1891. And it isn't until 1911 that `\\index[gamebook]\{y Cajal, Ramon\}`\{=latex\}Ramon y Cajal uses the Golgi stain to highlight neurons in the hippocampus, confirming the neuron doctrine.
\f1 \

\f2 \
None of that stopped Charcot from classifying a huge number conditions and diseases we still recognize today: multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS or \'93Lou Gerig's disease,\'94 it was once called \'93Charcot's disease\'94), lenticulostriate artery (\'93Charcot's artery\'94), joint arthopathy (\'93Charcot's joint\'94), peroneal muscular atrophy (\'93Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease\'94), Charcot Wilbrand syndrome, Charcot's intermittent hepatic fever and even Parkinson's disease were all first named or described by Charcot.
\f1 \

\f2 \
Methodologically, Charcot advocated what he called the 'anatomo-clinical' method, which meant careful anatomical analysis performed largely post-mortum combined with case studies of vivisection in both animals and human subjects. Once a behavioral deficiency has been identified, careful anatomical studies are carried out to determine any corresponding anatomical 'deficiency,' or lesion. In his own words:
\f1 \

\f2 \
\pard\pardeftab720\li283\partightenfactor0
\cf0 >Allow me to recall to your minds the opinion which that most illustrious physiologist, Claude Bernard, thus expressed:\'97\'93Pathology,\'94 said he, \'93should not he subordinated to physiology. Quite the reverse. Set up first the medical problem which arises from the observation of a malady, and afterwards seek for a physiological explanation. To act otherwise would be to risk overlooking the patient, and distorting the malady.\'94 These are excellent words, which I have ventured to quote verbatim, because they are absolutely significant. They enable us to clearly understand that the whole domain of pathology appertains strictly to the physician, who alone can cultivate it and make it fruitful, and that it necessarily remains closed to the physiologist who, systematically confined within the precincts of his laboratory, disdains the teaching of the hospital ward. (p. 8)

\cf0 In 1878, he began extensive work on hypnosis. `\\index[gamebook]\{hypnosis\}`\{=latex\}Hypnosis had been practiced at the `\\index[gamebook]\{Salp\'eatri\'e8re\}`\{=latex\}Salp\'eatri\'e8re for over 50 years---since the days of `\\index[gamebook]\{Pinel, Philippe\}`\{=latex\}Pinel, in fact. Charcot became increasingly interested in the therapeutic use of hypnosis to cure what he called `\\index[gamebook]\{hysteria\}`\{=latex\}\'92hysteria', a vaguely-defined collection of usually transient symptoms that included paralysis, anesthesias, visual or auditory agnosias, temporary blindness or deafness, amnesia and seizures. While 'hysteria' came to be identified closely with women, Charcot himself believed that it could effect men, and treated many men that he diagnosed with hysteria.
\f1 \

\f2 \
This does not mean, however, that Charcot gave up his commitment to neurological explanations of behavior. He simply allowed functional and/or physiological explanations in addition to the anatomical. In his words:
\f1 \

\f2 \
\pard\pardeftab720\li283\partightenfactor0
\cf0 > There is another important fact in the history of neuroses in general, and of hysteria in particular, which clearly shows that these diseases do not form, in pathology, a class apart, governed by other physiological laws than the common ones. (13)
\f1 \

\f2 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sa120\partightenfactor0
\cf0 I've quoted this passage because it is the first use of the word `\\index[gamebook]\{neurosis!first usage\}`\{=latex\}\'92neuroses' in print.  It's root in neurological terminology is obvious, but here Charcot uses it to demarcate transient, psychological, functional or dynamic neurological conditions from the incurable, intransient, anatomical neurological conditions. The former we classify as \'91mental\'92, the latter \'91neurological\'92---even today. 'Neurosis' thus supplants 'mental alienation' and 'nervousness' as the descriptor of the set of psychological conditions that cannot be explained physically, even though its root is connected to the idea of a physical manifestation in \'91neurons.\'92

Blocked from further education by antisemitism in Germany from further education, a young Sigmund Freud came to study with M. Charcot in 1890. There, he learned the techniques of hypnosis and studied many cases of hysteria. Later in life, Freud frequently referred to Charcot as his 'mentor,' and even attributed the idea that all neuroses originate 'in the genitals' to {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "scrivcmt://58E14AEE-FA55-40A7-BA41-AAAAA76124DF"}}{\fldrslt Charcot.}}

In his eulogy for Charcot, Sigmund Freud said:
\f1 \

\f2 \
\pard\pardeftab720\li283\partightenfactor0
\cf0 >He was not a reflective man, not a thinker: He had the nature of an artist\'97he was, as he himself said, a 'visuel', a man who sees... He used to look again and again at the things he did not understand, to deepen his impression of them day by day, till suddenly an understanding of them dawned on him.  In his mind's eye the apparent chaos presented by the continual repetition of the same symptoms then ave way to order: the new nosological picture emerged, characterized by the constant combination of certain groups of symptoms... He might be heard to say that the greatest satisfaction a man could have was to see something new-- that is, to recognize it as new; and he remarked against and again n the difficulty and value of this kind of 'seeing'. (Quoted in Mad, Bad and Sad, p. 128)

\cf0 It should be fairly obvious that Freud here is dismissing, essentially, Charcot's `\\index[gamebook]\{Bacon, Francis\}`\{=latex\}Baconian approach to scientific classification: careful, close observation with only careful, conservative theoretical suppositions. Unlike Charcot, who is remembered only in the names of the diseases he classified, Freud became globally famous for his theoretical suppositions. Whereas Charcot was content with describing neuroses and localizing them in the nervous system, Freud sought to explain the origins of neuroses in non-physical terms.`\\index[gamebook]\{Charcot, Jean-Martin|(\}`\{=latex\}
