\f2\i0\b0\fs24 \cf0 While homosexual behavior has appeared throughout human history, the notion of homosexuality as an \'93orientation\'94 or \'93personality\'94 is relatively recent.

\fs20 \cf0 The idea of homosexuality as a lifestyle connected to personality is, in the English speaking world at least, indelibly linked to the public persona of the author `\\index[gamebook]\{Wilde, Oscar\}`\{=latex\}Oscar Wilde. While he was studying classics at Oxford, he began advocating aestheticism, the view that aesthetic values override moral or social values in the understanding of art and literature. Wilde parlayed his success as a playwright into fame, cultivating a flamboyant public personal, known for dressing immaculately and flamboyantly, entertaining wealthy society women, having a sharp wit and a talent at dinner conversation. His masterwork \'91The Portrait of Dorian Gray\'92 plays with this persona in the characters of Lord Henry Wotton and Dorian Gray himself.\
\
 In 1895, he and his companion Alfred Taylor were convicted of acts of 'gross {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "scrivcmt://A8381E19-A4C0-4963-9123-A82A724CCE9E"}}{\fldrslt indecency'}} and sentenced to two years hard labor.
\f0\fs24  
\f2 Their trial was 'the trial of the century' in the English upper-class, and to this day, many of Wilde's personal characteristics inform the common stereotypes of homosexual men; fastidiousness with respect to personal appearance, wittiness and social adeptness, esp. with upper-class women, are all traceable to Wilde himself.

\cf0 The next fifty years were not kind to gay folks.  \'93Treatments\'94 for homosexuals included surgical interventions such as castration, vasectomies, lobotomies, sterilization, clitoridectomies, hysterectomies; chemical interventions such as sexual stimulants, depressants, hormonal injections, and pharmacological shock; psychological interventions included adjustment therapy, psychoanalysis, hypnosis, `\\index[gamebook]\{Aversion therapy\}`\{=latex\}aversion therapy that included electric shock and {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "scrivcmt://EBB56573-714F-436F-9AF3-7D3D63E0A49B"}}{\fldrslt desensitization;}} and social psychological interventions patterned on Alcoholics Anonymous like 'Homosexuals Anonymous' and others.

`\\newthought\{One of the saddest stories\}`\{=latex\} of this era is that of Alan Turing, who was mentioned in the section above on `\\fullref\{concurrentdevelopments:logicandcomputing\}`\{=latex\}. Turing was one of the greatest mathematicians and logicians of his era, if not the greatest. During WWII, he worked at Bletchley Park as one of Churchill's famed code-breakers. His efforts in breaking the German codes lead directly to the development of modern logic and the invention of the electronic computer. He is generally considered to be the founder of both modern cryptography and computer science. While working at Princeton, he became friends with Claude Shannon, who is now recognized as the father of information theory. Quite literally, Turing is to the contemporary information age what Newton was to the age of mechanics, or Einstein the nuclear age.
\f0 \

\f2 \
But Turing was also gay. In 1952, he was prosecuted and convicted for being a homosexual. Sentenced to hormone therapy and stripped of his military clearance. As all his work during the war was classified at the highest levels of secrecy, this loss meant he had no access to his lives\'92 work---and what is worth, most people knew nothing about it.  He committed suicide on June 7\super th\nosupersub , 1954. His contributions to the war effort became known only in the 1980s with work by Andrew Hodges, a British Historian.  In 2004, the British government released details of Turing\'92s code-breaking machine, the Colossus.  The Colossus existed before the \'91Eniac,\'92 which was previously thought to be the first electronic {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "scrivcmt://6BF0FAC0-25CC-4C2F-9A25-13C18300F3A2"}}{\fldrslt computer. }}\
\
In 2009, the British Government started a program of accepting online petitions from citizens of the UK. One of the first to be submitted, and promoted by Richard Dawkins, was a call for an official apology to Alan Turing for unjust prosecution. On 10 September 2009, Prime Minister Gordon Brown issued a formal apology to Alan Turing, stating:

During WWII, young men and women who were accused of homosexuality in Pacific theater of operations tended to be discharged from the military in California ports, including San Diego, Long Beach and San Francisco. Many, if not most, of these young people could not return to their hometowns because of their dishonorable discharge from the military.

\f2\i0 . It was revolutionary.
\f0 \

\f2 \
Kinsey and his assistants had interviewed 5,300 white males from all walks of American life. The interviews required up to 521 questions, depending on the interviewee\'92s experiences.  Kinsey reported that a large number of men\'97up to 45%\'97reported having at least one homosexual encounter during his adolescence.  These encounters are most frequent at young age, dropping to a stable 10% of the population by age 20-25. These numbers, Kinsey fears, may not tell the whole story because:
\f0 \

\f2 \
\pard\pardeftab720\li283\partightenfactor0
\cf0 >The social significance of the homosexual is considerably emphasized by the fact that both Jewish and Christian churches have considered this aspect of human sexuality to be abnormal and immoral. \'85 Social custom and our Anglo-American law are sometimes very severe in penalizing one who is discovered to have had homosexual relations. In consequence, many persons who have had such experiences are psychically disturbed, and not a few of them have been in open conflict with the social organization. ([p. 610][#Kinsey:1998ur])
\f0 \

\f2 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sa120\partightenfactor0
\cf0 The Kinsey report found that homosexual activity as a common part of male sexual development.

\cf0  The Mattachine society, named for a European tradition of theater masks, sought to change the prevailing view of homosexuality by presenting the membership as no different than the mainstream heterosexual society. Its members dressed in suits and skirts, and showed no 'outward signs' of homosexuality. These 'outward signs' are, of course, those stereotypes we identified earlier as originating with Oscar Wilde. Mattachine society demonstrations---held annually in front of Independence Hall in Philadelphia on July 4\super th\nosupersub ---were sober affairs of men in gray suits and women in dresses walking up and down in straight lines, conspicuously *not* holding hands or being affectionate to one another.

\f2\i0\b0 \cf0 After the publication of the Kinsey report, `\\index[gamebook]\{Hooker, Evelyn|(\}`\{=latex\}Hooker finally decided to meet Fromm's challenge. She designed an experiment to determine if homosexuals were mentally disturbed, for which she received a grant from the National Institute on Mental Health in 1954. She recruited 30 homosexual males from the Mattachine society as well as the gay community generally. An equal number of heterosexual men were recruited from civil organizations around the L.A.. Individuals in the groups were matched with respect to age, IQ and education level. All people currently in therapy for mental health were excluded from the study.  \
\
This alone was a major step forward in the study of male homosexuality, as all previous psychological studies had found their subjects in psychiatric wards, army barracks or clinical settings. This practice meant that it was impossible to distinguish between behaviors that originate in the person from behaviors that result from the treatment itself.
\f0 \

\f2 \
Hooker`\\index[gamebook]\{Hooker, Evelyn\}`\{=latex\} tested the resulting 60 men using standard psychological tests: the Rorschach, Thematic Apperception Test (TAT) and the Make-A-Picture-Story Test (MAPS). The data was blinded and mixed, and then sent to psychologists with expertise on these the tests who were instructed to score them normally and return the scores.  Hooker found no significant difference between the 30 homosexual and 30 heterosexual males with respect to standard tests for mental disturbances, indicating that homosexual men were no more likely to be neurotic than equivalent heterosexual men.

\cf0 `\\index[gamebook]\{Stonewall|(\}`\{=latex\}By the 1960s, tensions were growing in the gay community. Another group of younger {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "scrivcmt://76550411-8600-49F2-B901-57086044E599"}}{\fldrslt gay}} activists were growing irritated with both the slow progress of the Mattachine society and its restrictions on behavior. In 1968, a group of young 'street-activists' disrupted a meeting of the American Medical Association in New York by shouting down Charles Socarides, a Psychiatrist known for his psychoanalytic treatment of homosexuals.

\fs24 \cf0 But everything changed forever on Saturday, June 28, 1969 at 1:20 AM, when the police raided the Stonewall Inn in Greenwich Village. These raids were common---the police would arrest everyone, roughing people up, stealing money for bribes and generally intimidating the population.  But this time, for reasons we still don\'92t exactly understand, the gay and lesbian patrons of the Stonewall Inn resisted. Events escalated. The riots that followed lasted until Wednesday night, July 3rd.\'a0

\f2\fs24 \cf0 On July 4
\fs16 \super th
\fs24 \nosupersub , the gay community\'92s attention turned to Independence Hall in Philadelphia and the Mattachine society\'92s annual march. As usual, Frank Kameny and Barbara Gittings, long time leaders of that gay and lesbian advocacy group, required the women to wear skirts and men suits. But the tide had turned. The young protestors from Stonewall would not conform. Kameny\'92s approach of assimilation  to \'93straight\'94 behavior had been surpassed by the direct action begun at Stonewall. Militant groups such as the Gay Liberation Front and the Gay Activist Alliance sprouted up overnight (both started in New York). Plans were made to confront those who continued to classify homosexuality as a mental disorder, and directly challenge those who continued to treat homosexuals using barbaric methods.
