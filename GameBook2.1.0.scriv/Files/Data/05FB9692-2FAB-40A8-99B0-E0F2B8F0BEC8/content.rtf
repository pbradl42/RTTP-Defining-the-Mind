Money and you collaborated on a series of studies of so-called 'sissy boys' when you were still ABD starting in the 1960s. This collaboration has yielded a number of studies, including your recent paper \'93Mythological, historical, and cross-cultural aspects of transsexualism\'94 which is included in your co-edited book
\f11\i  *Transsexualism and Sex Reassignment
\f3\i0 .* Transsexualism has become your life-long research topic.\
\
You are dissatisfied today with the state of the science of sexuality, in part because it is too dominated by theoretical positions and not by empirical research. Moreover, research into sexuality is conducted by individuals in many different disciplines, and there is no single organization or journal that can unify all the researchers from all these disciplines.\
\
Your goal is to create an organization that can promote and defend the empirical, scientific study of sexuality in the U.S. and abroad.\

### Game Objectives\
\pard\pardeftab709\sa120\partightenfactor0

\f3\b0\fs24 \cf0 \
You have a long-standing friendship with both Harold Lief and Diane Fordney-Settlage, support here when and where appropriate.
\f0\i\b `\\index[rolesheets]\{Fordney-Settlage, Diane\}`\{=latex\}
\f3\i0\b0 \
\
You should argued forcefully in favor of the removal of 'homosexuality' from the DSM. You argue that the grounds for deciding the issue should be the "historical and cross-cultural groundings in homosexual expression, associated psychiatric features accompanying a homosexual orientation, the emotional consequences to the homosexual of societal condemnation, and behaviors of other species."\
\
You should oppose, however, efforts of the Board of Directors to put it to a public vote, saying that such "a shotgun marriage between science and democracy" was "ludicrous." A true scientific principle, that is supported by data, need not have public support to be the right thing to do.

Working with J.

The task force should be be balanced between psychologists and psychiatrists, so you need a psychiatrist to support the effort \'96 E. Hooker and G. Albee
