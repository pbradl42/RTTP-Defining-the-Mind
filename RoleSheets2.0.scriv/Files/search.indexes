AN EXAMINATION OF WILHELM REICH’S DEMONSTRATIONS OF ORGONE ENERGY
Author:
Robert L. Spitzer, M.D. - Cornell University (April 1953)
Purpose
Wilhelm Reich’s early work in psychoanalysis gradually led him into a field which he now calls biophysics. The concept of a new kind of energy, which he calls “orgone energy,” is basic to his present work. Reich defines orgone energy as “Primordial cosmic energy; universally present and demonstrable visually, thermically, electroscopically, and by means of Geiger-Müller counters. In the living organism: biological energy. Discovered by Reich between 1936 and 1940.” [1]
In his many writings of the past decade, Reich has by means of the concept of orgone energy presented explanations of such varied phenomena as the origin of life, the origin of the galaxies, the aetiology of cancer and neuroses, the belief of people in God, and many other phenomena. To one who has carefully read Reich’s work, it becomes clear that if orgone energy does exist and has the properties ascribed to it by Reich, then clearly, an understanding of orgone energy is a most valuable piece of information, useful in explaining many riddles of nature.
The purpose of this paper is to present a critical examination of the demonstrations of orgone energy offered by Reich in his book, The Cancer Biopathy. [2] The examination offered in this paper consists of the duplication by the writer of eight crucial experiments offered by Reich as proof of the existence of orgone energy along with control experiments devised by the writer to better ascertain the validity of the conclusions that Reich draws from his data.
Selection of Experiments
It was not possible, nor necessary, to duplicate all of the experiments described by Reich. “Bion” experiments involving the use of an extremely high-powered microscope and experiments using a Geiger-Müller counter were not done, because it was impossible to secure the necessary instruments. A study of the therapeutic effect of the Orgone Accumulator upon the human organism could not be attempted, because to do justice to the problem, it would be necessary to have at least eight subjects devote a half an hour a day for a period of at least a month, and such subjects were not available. However, of the eight experiments duplicated, three in particular form the pillars upon which the verification of the concept of orgone energy rests: namely, the visual, thermal, and electroscopic demonstrations.

part of Reich’s work which deals specifically with the concept of orgone energy. It is in no way meant as an evaluation of any other part of Reich’s work or of his psychological and psychoanalytical theories.
The work outlined in these pages was not done hastily but in all, took eight months to complete. It was all conducted from September 1952 to April 1953 at Ithaca, New York. All of the experiments are fairly simple and can easily be reproduced by anyone interested. The experiments were approached objectively and the conclusions drawn were dictated solely by the data collected.
I. Visual Demonstration of Orgone Energy
A. Flickering in the Sky
[3] Problem
According to Reich, orgone energy can be observed visibly in the sky by looking “as if in the far distance.” The energy is perceived as a wave-like, rhythmical flickering, with rapidly appearing and disappearing dots and lines of light. Because the phenomenon changes with various weather conditions and ceases if the eyes are closed, Reich concludes that the phenomenon is present throughout the atmosphere and visible “in the sky.”
The experiments performed here attempted to control the focal distance between the retina of the eye and the outside world to determine whether the phenomenon is in the sky or atmosphere of the earth or solely in the eye of the observer.
Procedure
Eight naive subjects were used. Each subject was placed in front of a window through which the sky could be viewed. Each was instructed to look as if in the far distance and report when he observed the flickering phenomenon. The subject was then seated in front of a ground-glass screen that was illuminated by an electric light bulb attached to a rheostat to vary the intensity of the light. With his eyes a fraction of an inch away from the illuminated screen with the bulb at its most intense illumination, the subject was asked to report what he saw. The intensity of the bulb was then varied, and the subject was asked to report any changes in what he saw.
Results
All eight subjects quickly perceived the flickering phenomenon in the sky described by Reich. All eight subjects, when seated in front of the bright, ground-glass screen reported that they saw the same phenomenon as in the sky only that it appeared more intense in front of the glass screen. All eight subjects reported that the phenomenon became less intense and finally disappeared as the intensity of the bulb was lowered.
Conclusions
If the phenomenon were in the sky, then the phenomenon should either disappear completely or be much less intense when the eyes are directly in front of a translucent screen. However, the results prove, with a confidence limit of 95%, that the phenomenon of flickering in the sky has nothing whatever to do with an energy in the sky but exists solely in the eye and becomes visible upon adequate illumination of the eye. Reich’s claim that the phenomenon is less intense on hazy days due to the absorption of orgone energy by the
￼￼￼￼￼
humidity appears to be without foundation, as the critical factor seems to be the intensity of the field as shown by the fact that all of the subjects reported that the phenomenon disappeared when the light was turned down.
As to just what occurs in the eye which creates this phenomenon, whether it be blood corpuscles moving on the retina or the random discharge of rods or cones, is not of direct concern here but requires further study.
B. Perception of Orgone Energy in an Orgone Room
[4] Problem
Reich reports that in a light-tight, dark room, only black is perceived, while in an “orgone room” constructed by lining a regular room with sheet metal, the higher concentration of orgone energy is visible in the following manner: “In the course of about half an hour the complete darkness gives way to a vague blue-gray shimmer. It is as if vapors of gray blue color were slowly moving through the room.” [5] The first part of the experiment is devised to see whether the light phenomenon in an orgone room, as described by Reich, differs from that observed in a regular room. Reich maintains that the light phenomena were objective and were magnified with simple magnifying glasses. An attempt was made to determine whether the light phenomena were objective or existed solely in the eye of the observer. Reich reports that in an orgone room, the eyes become irritated, and hence an attempt was made to determine whether such irritation is reported in a regular dark room.
Procedure
Eight naïve subjects were used in two groups of four. Each group on two separate occasions sat in a light-tight, dark room and were instructed to write as best they could on a blank, white card everything that they saw and to make careful note of the possible form, color, and movement, if any, of what they saw. If they saw anything, they were to put their hands in front of their eyes and to report whether the phenomenon changed. They were instructed not to talk while in the darkroom about what they saw. As each group left the darkroom, the members were instructed to record whether their eyes felt irritated.
Results
All but one of the subjects wrote that they saw various colors other than black. Only one subject reported that all he saw was black, although he qualified it by describing it as “black of different intensities” to indicate a fog-like formation.
All of the subjects, except the one who saw only black, reported movement of various kinds. Some saw fog-like movement: dots, streaks, etc. The same seven subjects later reported that their eyes felt irritated.
All of the subjects reported that the phenomenon did not change in the least way when they put their hands in front of their eyes.
Conclusions
Reich’s claim that in a dark room “We see nothing but black, that is, nothing. . . . In an absolute darkroom there is absolute darkness” [6] appears to be completely erroneous. Immediately or upon adaptation of the eyes, the dark room does not appear black but
￼
generally grayish, and various colors are perceived as demonstrated by this experiment, with a confidence limit of 95%. Hence, the light phenomenon which Reich describes as being peculiar to the orgone room appears to be no different from that observed in a regular dark room.
As the light phenomenon was not affected by the placing of the hands over the eyes, the phenomenon must be subjective and therefore cannot be magnified.
As seven of the subjects all reported that their eyes were irritated in an ordinary dark room; there is no grounds for believing that any energy peculiar to an orgone room is responsible.
Thus, the light phenomenon in an orgone room appears to be the same as that observed in a regular dark room and is a subjective phenomenon. The exact nature and cause of the phenomenon, like the cause of the flickering in the sky, is not of direct concern here but requires further study. The irritations reported by the subjects is most likely due to the straining effect of keeping one’s eyes open in the dark for a long period of time without focusing the eyes on any subject.
II. Electrostatic Demonstration of Orgone Energy
A. Electroscopic Demonstration of Two Basic Principles of Orgone Energy
[7]
Problem
Reich contends that what is known as “static electricity” is in reality orgone energy. He believes that orgone energy has two basic governing principles: 1) orgone energy and organic material attract each other, and 2) orgone energy and metal first attract each other and then immediately repel each other. As will be seen in the problem dealing with the thermal demonstration of orgone energy in an Orgone Accumulator, these principles are basic to the theory behind the construction of Reich’s Orgone Accumulator.
The purpose of this experiment was to duplicate Reich’s demonstration of the above two principles. He describes his experiment and the conclusions that he draws from them as follows:
A metal sphere is set on a rubber or cork plate. On one side of the equator of the sphere, at a distance of about 2–3 mm., we suspend a small piece of cork, on the other side, at the same distance, a small piece of tinfoil. The metal sphere is connected by a wire with an electroscope.
We then charge a polystyrene rod by stroking it once or twice, without rubbing, over our hair. The rod is then brought near the metal point of the electroscope which is connected with the sphere. . . . The cork will move toward the metal sphere and will adhere to it for a shorter or longer period of time. This means: the orgone energy in the rod has led to the formation of an orgone energy field around the metal sphere, in which organic material is attracted and held fast.
At the other side of the sphere we notice what happens with the tinfoil when we approach the charged rod to the electroscope. We observe that the effect on the tinfoil is different [emphasis mine—R.S.] from that on the cork. The
￼
tinfoil is first attracted toward the metal sphere but immediately repelled and held at a distance. That is, two metallic substances in the orgone energy field repel each other. From this it follows also that metal attracts orgone but instead of absorbing it, as organic material does, it repels it. [8]
Procedure
The experimental design as described by Reich, as above, was duplicated, and data on various days was collected.
Results
Whenever the electroscope was charged, the cork and tinfoil were attracted toward the metal sphere. As soon as the cork and tinfoil touched the sphere, both the cork and tinfoil were immediately repelled and held at a distance. The cork and tinfoil then both gradually came closer to the metal shape and again, as soon as they touched the sphere, both were repelled and held at a distance. This process continued for some time, until the charge originally put on the electroscope was discharged.
Conclusions
The data obtained directly contradicts Reich’s data. In the above experiment, there seemed to be no marked difference between the behavior of the cork and the tinfoil, thus yielding no evidence that orgone energy or static electricity attracts organic material and attracts and then repels metallic material.
The classical theory of static electricity easily explains the behavior of the cork and tinfoil. A charged rod contains an excess of electrons, which creates a negative charge on the rod. This negative charge attracts all neutral objects to it. As soon as the smaller object touches the negative sphere, some of the excess electrons flow into the neutral object, giving it a negative charge, because it then has an excess of electrons. The object and the charged sphere are now both negative and hence repel each other. Gradually, the electric charge on the object leaks off, and the object is once more neutral and is attracted to the sphere. This process continues until the charge on the sphere has been sufficiently dissipated.
B. Electroscopic Discharge in the Orgone Accumulator and the Atmosphere
[9]
Problem
As was seen in the previous experiment, Reich believes that what is called “static electricity” and orgone energy are one and the same thing. He claims that the proof of this lies in the fact that the discharge of an electroscope is slower inside of an orgone accumulator than in the atmosphere due to the higher concentration of orgone energy in the accumulator. He reasons as follows:
The energy with which the electroscope was charged will be discharged into the air the more rapidly the lower the energy tension is in the air relative to the charge of the electroscope. Conversely, the energy will be discharged the more slowly the higher the tension is in the surrounding air, that is, the smaller the difference between the energy charge of the electroscope and that of the surrounding air. [10]
￼
￼The purpose of this experiment was to duplicate Reich’s demonstration of the relative discharges of an electroscope in an orgone accumulator and in the air.
Procedure
Reich does not say whether he used one electroscope first in the air and then in the accumulator, or vice versa, or whether he used two electroscopes at the same time, one in the air and the other in the accumulator. As will be shown later, these and other methodological procedures turn out to be exceedingly important. His general procedure, which was followed accurately, is to charge an electroscope up to the tenth scale division of the particular electroscope he used and then to measure how long it takes for the leaf to fall until it reads the eighth scale division. This time value is obtained from discharging the electroscope both in the air and in the accumulator. The procedure is repeated on various occasions during all kinds of weather.
The glass back of the electroscope used was replaced with a piece of cardboard that had two large holes in it, so that the air in the electroscope could communicate with the outer air as Reich suggests.
In the beginning of the experiment, the following procedure was adopted: the electroscope was charged in the air up to the ninth division on a cardboard scale. The length of time that it took until it discharged to the seventh division was noted. The electroscope was then charged up to the ninth scale division and placed in the orgone accumulator described in a following experiment, and the length of time required for a similar discharge to the seventh scale division was recorded. The procedure was repeated many times a day on different days during varied weather conditions.
The data obtained from this procedure described above for four days are as follows:
Discharge Time in from Room
9-7 (1) 6 minutes 9-7 (1) 4 minutes 9-7 (1) 9 minutes 9-7 (1) 9 minutes 9-7 (1) 3 minutes 9-7 (1) 3 minutes 9-7 (1) 2 minutes
Time in Orgone Accumulator
(2) 15 minutes (2) 10 minutes (2) 21 minutes (2) 21 minutes (2) 8 minutes (2) 9 minutes (2) 8 minutes
This data would indicate that the discharge is slower in an accumulator than in the air, as Reich supports. However, after doing the last run, it suddenly occurred to the writer that perhaps the fact that in every run, the electroscope was first discharged in the air and then discharged in the accumulator might have had some effect on the results. The electroscope was then taken out of the accumulator and recharged immediately in the air and left to discharge. The same discharge which had taken 8 minutes in the accumulator now took 12 minutes in the air! The electroscope was again immediately recharged in the air and the
discharge then took 14 minutes.
￼Thus, it became evident that the order of presentation seemed to be at least in part responsible for the slower discharges in the accumulator. Continued experimentation revealed the following facts: if the electroscope is repeatedly charged in the air, the time required for the electroscope to discharge a given unit increases until it reaches a maximum limit which remains fairly constant, as long as the electroscope is immediately charged after being discharged. If the electroscope is not charged for a few hours, the same process is repeated until a maximum limit is again reached.
It became obvious that in order to determine whether the discharge in the accumulator was slower than in the air, it was first necessary to bring the discharge time up to its limit by repeated chargings and dischargings, and when the time was a constant for discharge, then measure the discharge in an accumulator.
Results
Using the above mentioned procedure, the following results were obtained:

Conclusions
It was found that when an electroscope is discharged in the air and then in an orgone accumulator, the discharge in the accumulator is slower. However, it was also found that this effect was at least in part due to the order of presentation, as the time it takes for an electroscope to discharge a given unit increases up to a maximum limit. When the maximum limit was reached in the air and the electroscope was then discharged in an accumulator, it was found that the discharge was not slower in the accumulator but that within the accuracy of the instrument, the data revealed no significant difference in time values.
As Reich makes no mention of the increase in discharge time that was discovered in this experiment, it is possible that his results are due to the mistake of discharging the electroscope first in the air and then in the accumulator before the electroscope has reached its maximum discharge value. It may be that the effect discovered here does not occur with all electroscopes, although the same effort was found to be present with two other electroscopes built differently than the one used here.
(9) 13 minutes
(5) 13 minutes (7) 13 minutes
￼The data thus gives no suggestion that any kind of an energy is being concentrated in the orgone accumulator such that it slows the discharge of an electroscope.
III. Thermal Demonstration of Orgone Energy
[11] Problem
Believing that 1) organic substances absorb orgone energy, 2) metallic substances reflect orgone energy, and 3) stoppage of the kinetic energy of the orgone energy results in a temperature rise, Reich has devised an apparatus, namely the Orgone Accumulator, already mentioned, with the electroscopic demonstration of orgone energy, which supposedly accumulates the energy.
The Orgone Accumulator can be made large enough for an individual to sit in, as in the orgone-therapy treatment of cancer patients, or smaller for experimental purposes. The design is simple and is basically a box of any size that is lined with a metallic material such as galvanized sheet iron or metal screen and has an outside layer of a nonconducting substance (what Reich calls “organic”) such as cotton or fiberglass. The accumulator may consist of merely one layer of metallic and nonconducting substances or of many layers. An increase in the number of layers supposedly results in an increase in the orgonotic potential of the atmosphere to the inside of the accumulator and hence a higher concentration of orgone energy. Accumulators used in therapy vary from three to twenty layers.
The purpose of this experiment is to duplicate Reich’s demonstration of the thermal effect of the accumulation of orgone energy. He writes:
The energy particles within the box are thrown from metal wall to metal wall. They are being stopped on all sides. Since heat ascends, any possible temperature rise will be most readily registered above the top metal sheet. There must be a temperature difference between the enclosed air in the cylinder above the accumulator on the one hand and the rest of the room on the other. . . . If our assumptions are correct, the temperature difference must be positive and always present. . . . Measurements taken several times a day over a period of weeks reveal an arithmetic mean of about 0.5degreesC. [12]
Procedure
Following Reich’s description of an experimental Orgone Accumulator used in the thermal demonstration of the energy, a box was built measuring one foot square on the inside, lined with galvanized sheet metal and having five layers of steel wool and fiberglass. The walls were about five inches thick on each side. A metal cylinder about six inches long was connected to the top of the sheet-metal lining. A thermometer, accurate to one tenth of a degree centigrade, was inserted through the top of the cylinder and rested a fraction of an inch above the top piece of the sheet metal of the accumulator.
A control box constructed solely out of organic material was built, and a similar thermometer that had been calibrated with the first thermometer was inserted inside the box. The two boxes were placed at opposite ends of a room. The temperature readings for both boxes were taken regularly several times a day for a period of about three weeks and then every few days for a period of about three months. The two boxes were then placed on a porch that had no heating that was separated from the outside by a screen door. The readings were taken every week for about a month and a half.
￼Results
The first readings varied from day to day but all followed a similar pattern. As the room warmed up in the morning from the cold night, the temperature of the accumulator (To) was always slightly lower than the temperature of the control (Tc). In the late afternoon, as the room began to cool, the temperature of the accumulator was slightly higher than the temperature of the control. Thus:
Morning Afternoon (To–Tc)=0 to –2degreesC (To–Tc)=0 to plus 2degreesC
The temperature was negative in the morning and gradually became positive by the afternoon. The maximum difference reached was about 2degreesC.
As at least part of (To–Tc) was due to the fact that the accumulator was a better insulator than the control box and thus lagged behind the warming room in the morning and cooling room in the afternoon, the temperature differences could not show if in addition to the lagging behind of the accumulator a slight amount of heat nevertheless was created in the accumulator.
In order to equalize the insulating properties of both the accumulator and the control, the control box was stuffed with cotton, which further insulated it from the room temperature. In order to vary the insulating effect of the control, the thermometer was fitted loosely so it could either be inserted deeper into the cotton, to increase the insulating effect, or withdrawn, to diminish the insulating effect. The two thermometers now always read exactly the same, at all times of the day, during all kinds of weather, in the room or on the cold porch, where the temperature went to as low as 6degreesC.
Thus, when the insulating effect of the accumulator and the control were equalized:
In All Kinds of Weather and All Times of the Day (To–Tc)=0.0degreesC
Conclusions
According to Reich, Orgone Accumulators work everywhere, yet after constructing a control box to equalize the insulating effect of the Orgone Accumulator, no temperature difference was recorded. The data give no indication that any kind of kinetic energy is being transformed into heat. There appears to be no foundation to the belief that an orgone- energy accumulator concentrates an energy which raises the temperature of the accumulator.
In October 1952, a letter was sent to Reich describing the results of this experiment. He wrote back saying that “severe atmospheric disturbances of the last two years” have seriously upset the temperature differences. If one then assumes that due to atmospheric conditions occurring in 1951 and 1952, orgone energy no longer breaks down into heat, then it is a wonder that such a drastic change in the functioning of orgone energy should not have had equally disastrous effects upon the human organism, as orgone energy is supposed to be the basic energy of life. One would expect mass plagues and outbreaks of disease, cancer, and other maladies during those years, yet the health of humanity during those years did not reveal any observable drastic change.
￼It might be mentioned that if such a temperature could be obtained, it would be relatively easy for an engineer to utilize it as a source of power. Such a power would be inexpensive, constant, easy to handle, and more than plentiful. It could transform barren wastes into thriving communities and provide the whole world with a source of energy that would revolutionize modern industry. Yet no such attempt to harness the reported temperature difference seems to have been made by either Reich or his coworkers. To my knowledge, no discussion of the possibilities discussed above have even appeared in the literature dealing with orgone energy. (See bibliography.)
IV. Orgonotic Attraction in the Energy Field of the Orgone Accumulator
[13]
Problem
Reich maintains that the energy field of an orgone accumulator has a specific effect upon a magnetic compass. He writes:
We bring a good magnetic needle close to an orgone accumulator of 1 cubic foot, in the following manner: 1) close to the center of the 4 upper edges, b) close to the center of the lower edges. Result: The magnetic north pole regularly turns toward the center of the upper edges, the magnetic south pole toward the center of the lower edges. Whichever edges we made the upper, lower or side edges, the magnetic needle always reacts as described. Conclusion: The reaction of the energy field of an orgone accumulator is of an orgonotic and not of a magnetic nature. [14]
The purpose of this experiment was to duplicate Reich’s experiment and if similar results were found, to devise a control which would test whether it is the specific structure of a Orgone Accumulator that is yielding the results and not merely the metal in the accumulator.
Procedure
A good magnetic compass was brought to the center of the top edges and then the center of the bottom edges of a one-cubic-foot accumulator, as was described in previous experiments. The accumulator was then turned upside down, and the compass was again brought to the center of the top and bottom edges. The compass was then brought to the top of a piece of sheet metal, one foot square, and then to the bottom. The piece of sheet metal was turned upside down and the procedure repeated.
Results
As Reich indicated, the magnetic north pole always turns to the top of the accumulator and the magnetic south pole to the bottom of the accumulator, regardless of which edges we make the top, bottom, or side. However, identical results are obtained using an ordinary piece of sheet metal. The top of the metal always attracts the magnetic north pole and the bottom the magnetic south pole of the compass.
Conclusions
In neglecting to run a control experiment, Reich makes the assumption that the described effect is due to the orgone accumulator and not merely the metal in the orgone accumulator.
He fails to realize that it is a well-known fact that metal, if left standing (such as the hulls of ships or the metallic structures of sky scrapers), eventually becomes magnetized, just as a piece of metal left in contact with a permanent magnet soon becomes magnetized. If the metal is then reversed, it becomes remagnetized. Reich is correct when he says: “The poles of magnetic attraction (south and north) are not interchangeable, except if one remagnetizes a weaker magnet with a stronger one.” [15] He fails to see that this statement also applies to the earth, which is the stronger magnet, and the sheet metal in the orgone accumulator, which acts as the weaker magnet.
One well-versed in Reich’s theory of orgone energy might argue that the piece of sheet metal used as a control in the above experiment is in fact a one-layer orgone accumulator. It is difficult to see how a straight piece of metal, which supposedly reflects orgone energy on both sides, can accumulate orgone energy. But even if this were the case, then surely Reich’s demonstration does not prove his contention that “The attraction effect of the orgone accumulator, then, is not due to definite parts of the material, and can, therefore, not be of a magnetic nature.” [16] This statement would only be true if a piece of sheet metal by itself did not give the described reaction.
V. The Organization of Matter from Free Orgone Energy
[17]
A. Freezing of Bion Water
[18]
In what Reich calls “Experiment XX,” he believes he has shown that under special conditions, orgone energy organizes itself into matter. He believes that when earth is made to “swell” by boiling or autoclavation, orgone energy is released from the disintegrating dirt, forming what he calls “bion water.” Bion water is yellow, supposedly indicating a high concentration of free orgone energy. When this water is made to freeze, the yellow color contracts into a spot in the center. When thawed, flakes of matter appear. From this, Reich concludes:
The appearance of a concentrated yellow spot in the center of the clear ice admits of only one plausible explanation: The free orgone energy in the freezing water acts exactly like the orgone energy in a freezing organism; contracting, it retracts from where the freezing takes place. [19]
The first part of the experiment attempted to duplicate this demonstration and then to perform a control experiment to determine whether in the freezing of any colored solution the color contracts toward the center, when the solution is composed of a colorless solvent and a colored solution.
Procedure
Bion water was made according to the directions given by Reich:
Ordinary garden soil is put through a screen and thus cleaned of stones, clumps, etc. The sifted garden soil is boiled for an hour in distilled or ordinary water (the procedure followed here—R.S.) or autoclaved for half an hour (at 120degreesC and 15 lb. pressure). The water is filtrated from the boiled soil. This clear fluid we call bion water. [20]
The fluid was then frozen and observed.
￼
In the control experiment, potassium permanganate (KMn04) was dissolved in a beaker of water until a purple solution was obtained. This was then frozen, and the behavior of the color observed.
Results
The filtrate of the boiled earth, which Reich calls bion water, appeared yellow. When frozen, the yellow color contracted toward the center of the solution. Exactly the same phenomenon was observed in the freezing of a purple solution of potassium permanganate: the purple color contracted toward the center, forming a deep-purple spot in the clear ice. The thawed bion water revealed flakes.
Conclusion
The bion water was found to be yellow and the yellow color contracted toward the center when the solution was frozen, exactly as described by Reich. However, because the purple color of a solution of a dissolved, colored salt yields the same results, the contraction of the yellow color in no way proves that the yellow color is due to a high concentration of orgone energy or justifies the statement of Reich that: “The appearance of a concentrated yellow spot in the center of the clear ice admits of only one plausible explanation” (emphasis mine—R.S.).
A much more plausible explanation would involve explaining the phenomenon on a molecular and crystalline basis. As the water freezes, the molecules of water are slowed down and form the crystalline structure of ice. As this process develops from the outside of the solution, which is colder, to the inside of the solution, the particles of dissolved coloring matter are forced to the center forming an intensely colored spot.
Reich is convinced that his bion water is “completely free of particles” [21] because it has been filtered. But that is an erroneous assumption. It is common knowledge that plants obtain food from the soil in the form of dissolved minerals. One cannot filter dissolved salts or even large, dissolved, long-chain organic molecules out of a solution. Reich has never even considered the possibility that the color could be from these soluble substances in the earth, of which he makes no mention.
B. The Production of Flakes from Distilled Bion Water
[22] Problem
Reich maintains that “If one distills bion water of about 40 to 50 OP (average concentration of orgone in bion water—R.S.) one finds some flakes immediately after cooling, and numerous flakes after freezing.” [22] This is of vital importance, for if the flakes can be produced from distilled bion water, then clearly the flakes are not due to dissolved particles, as any dissolved matter would not distill over with the water vapor. The purpose of this experiment was to duplicate Reich’s experiment of distilling bion water.
Procedure
Bion water, obtained from a previously described experiment, was distilled, and the distillate carefully observed for signs of flakes. It was then frozen and thawed and again observed for evidence of flakes.
￼
Results
￼The distillate of the bion water was perfectly clear and showed no signs of flakes. The thawed ice was likewise clear.
Conclusion
The results indicate that the flakes are not found when the bion water is distilled and then frozen and thawed as Reich maintains. This indicates that the flakes obtained in the previous experiment were not caused by any energy being transformed into matter but rather by dissolved substances which precipitated out upon freezing.
Summary
The experiments of Reich, used by him as proof of the existence of orgone energy, fall into two categories. In the first category are those experiments that when duplicated, yield the same results as Reich reports, only by the use of a control experiment, the conclusions that Reich draws from his experiments are invalidated. In this category are the experiments on flickering in the sky, visual phenomenon in an orgone room, the slower discharge of an electroscope in an Orgone Accumulator (if Reich made the methodological error already discussed in that experiment), the orgonotic attraction of a compass in the energy field of an Orgone Accumulator, and the contraction of the yellow color in frozen bion water. In the second category are those experiments that when duplicated do not yield the results that Reich reports. In this category are the experiments on the demonstration of the two basic principles of orgone energy: the thermal demonstration of orgone energy and the production of flakes from distilled bion water.
Eight experiments whose verification are essential to the scientific demonstration of orgone energy as reported by Reich have been duplicated. Orgone energy, with the properties ascribed to it by Reich, either stands or falls on the basis of these experiments. In every case, careful examination of the data in no way proves or even hints at the existence of orgone energy.
The Therapeutic Effect of the Orgone Accumulator
The results of the work described in this paper do not prove that the use of an Orgone Accumulator for therapeutic aid is without benefit. However, whatever effect there may be, it is not due to an energy demonstrable by the means outlined by Reich. In order to prove that the effect of the Orgone Accumulator is not due merely to the fact that it is 1) an enclosed box, and hence a good insulator or 2) lined with metal, which reflects heat well, control experiments must be run. To my knowledge, neither Reich himself nor any of his coworkers have done this. No such experiment has been reported in the literature dealing with orgone energy.

Biography
Judah (Judd) Marmor, M.D. (1910-2003) was an important Los Angeles psychiatrist and psychoanalyst, acknowledged for his leadership role in the movement to declassify homosexuality as a mental disease, which was removed from DSM-II in 1973.
Born on May 1, 1910 in London, England, Dr. Marmor grew up in Chicago and New York. He attended Columbia College as a Pulitzer scholar and graduated from the Columbia College of Physicians and Surgeons in 1933. Afterwards he began his postgraduate training in neurology and psychiatry and went into private psychiatric practice. Dr. Marmor began his psychoanalytic training four years later at the New York Psychoanalytic Institute in 1937.
After serving as a Senior Attending Surgeon (Lt.) in the Navy during WWII, Dr. Marmor and his wife Katherine moved to Los Angeles where he began as the Senior Attending Psychiatrist at Cedars of Lebanon Hospital in 1947. At this time he began visiting professorships in psychology and social welfare at the University of Southern California (USC) and the University of California, Los Angles (UCLA). In 1952, Dr. Marmor was appointed Clinical Professor of Psychiatry at the UCLA School of Medicine and a year later began as a Training Analyst for the Southern California Psychoanalytic Institute. In 1965 Dr. Marmor assumed the position of Director of the Division of Psychiatry at

￼Cedars-Sinai Medical Center and in 1972 became the first Franz Alexander Professor of Psychiatry Chair at the USC School of Medicine.
Dr. Marmor rose to prominence early in his career in academic and professional psychiatric and psychoanalytic communities; he was known as a talented educator, prolific writer and a compassionate clinician. He was respected for his analytic work with Hollywood celebrities, his strong commitment to the civil and women's rights movements, and was also known to the public as Abigail Van Buren's mental health expert in "Dear Abby" advice columns.
Judd Marmor was also a leading figure in the movement to declassify homosexuality as a mental disease. Dr. Marmor worked for many years with homosexual patients beginning in the 1940s, and his first book Sexual Inversion and early publications regarding the subject were some of the first to feature biopsychosocial approaches to the issue of homosexuality. In 1967, Evelyn Hooker, chairwoman of the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) Task Force on Homosexuality, nominated Judd to be a member. The NIMH Task Force produced an influential final report two years later, the recommendations of which would have far-reaching effects for social policy, training, treatment, and government funded research.
From 1970 to 1973 annual APA conferences were disrupted by protests from gay activists. Shortly after Dr. John Fryer's now famous "Dr. H. Anonymous" presentation at the annual APA conference in Dallas in May of 1972, the Nomenclature Committee, Dr. Marmor then the Vice President and Dr. John P. Spiegel the President-elect of the APA met with gay activist groups to discuss the category of homosexuality as it appeared in the Diagnostics and Statistics Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM). In 1973, a DSM-II development committee led by Dr. Robert Spitzer put forth a vote to the APA Board of Trustees, and a year later the APA membership would vote to remove homosexuality from the DSM-II. Dr. Marmor had long been an outspoken critic of classifying homosexuality as a mental illness and was influential in many historic events that ended discrimination against homosexuals in the psychiatric community.
Dr. Marmor sat on numerous journal editorial boards and boards of directors, and was the president and/or vice-president of six professional medical organizations and societies; including the American Academy of Psychoanalysis, American Psychiatric Association, Group for the Advancement of Psychiatry, Southern California Psychoanalytic Institute, and Southern California Psychoanalytic Society. He was the principle author and editor of 8 books and over 350 scientific journal articles featuring a spectrum of psychiatric and psychoanalytic topics. Judd and his wife Katherine, a clinical psychologist, were also collectors of contemporary art. Both sat on the Contemporary Art Council board of directors at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA) and were known to have lent and donated artworks to LACMA and MOCA.
Dr. Marmor died on December 16, 2003 at the age of 93.

A (September 1952) Social Science Statement
in the Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka Supreme Court Case
Kenneth B. Clark, Isidor Chein, and Stuart W. Cook
￼￼￼￼￼The problem of the segregation of racial and ethnic groups constitutes one of the major problems facing the American people today. It seems desirable, therefore, to summarize the contributions which contem- porary social science can make toward its resolution. There are, of course, moral and legal issues involved with respect to which the signers of the present statement cannot speak with any special authority and which must be taken into account in the solution of the problem. There are, however, also factual issues involved with respect to which certain conclusions seem to be justified on the basis of the avail- able scientific evidence. It is with these issues only that this paper is concerned. Some of the issues have to do with the consequences of segregation, some with the problems of changing from segregated to unsegregated practices. These two groups of issues will be dealt with in separate sections below. It is necessary, first, however, to define and delimit the problem to be discussed.
Definitions
For purposes of the present statement, segregation refers to that restriction of opportunities for different types of asso- ciations between the members of one racial, religious, national or geographic origin, or linguistic group and those of other groups, which results from or is supported by the action of any official body or agency representing some branch of government. We are not here concerned with such segregation as arises from the free movements of individuals which are neither enforced nor supported by official bodies, nor with the segregation of criminals or of individuals with communicable diseases which aims at protecting society from those who might harm it.
Where the action takes place in a social milieu in which the groups involved do not enjoy equal social status, the group that is of lesser social status will be referred to as the segregated group.
In dealing with the question of the effects of segrega- tion, it must be recognized that these effects do not take place in a vacuum, but in a social context. The segregation of Negroes and of other groups in the United States takes place in a social milieu in which “race” prejudice and discrimination exist. It is questionable in the view of some

students of the problem whether it is possible to have segregation without substantial discrimination. Myrdal1 states: “Segregation . . . is financially possible and, indeed, a device of economy only as it is combined with substantial discrimination” (p. 629). The imbededness of segregation in such a context makes it difficult to disentangle the effects of segregation per se from the effects of the context. Similarly, it is difficult to disentangle the effects of segre- gation from the effects of a pattern of social disorganization commonly associated with it and reflected in high disease and mortality rates, crime and delinquency, poor housing, disrupted family life and general substandard living condi- tions. We shall, however, return to this problem after consideration of the observable effects of the total social complex in which segregation is a major component.
At the recent Mid-century White House Conference on Children and Youth, a fact-finding report on the effects of prejudice, discrimination and segregation on the person- ality development of children was prepared as a basis for some of the deliberations.2 This report brought together the available social science and psychological studies which were related to the problem of how racial and religious prejudices influenced the development of a healthy person- ality. It highlighted the fact that segregation, prejudices and discriminations, and their social concomitants potentially damage the personality of all children—the children of the majority group in a somewhat different way than the more obviously damaged children of the minority group.
The report indicates that as minority group children learn the inferior status to which they are assigned—as they

observe the fact that they are almost always segregated and kept apart from others who are treated with more respect by the society as a whole—they often react with feelings of inferiority and a sense of personal humiliation. Many of them become confused about their own personal worth. On the one hand, like all other human beings they require a sense of personal dignity; on the other hand, almost no- where in the larger society do they find their own dignity as human beings respected by others. Under these conditions, the minority group child is thrown into a conflict with regard to his feelings about himself and his group. He wonders whether his group and he himself are worthy of no more respect than they receive. This conflict and confusion leads to self-hatred and rejection of his own group.
The report goes on to point out that these children must find ways with which to cope with this conflict. Not every child, of course, reacts with the same patterns of behavior. The particular pattern depends upon many inter- related factors, among which are: the stability and quality of his family relations; the social and economic class to which he belongs; the cultural and educational background of his parents; the particular minority group to which he belongs; his personal characteristics, intelligence, special talents, and personality pattern.
Some children, usually of the lower socio-economic
classes, may react by overt aggressions and hostility di-
rected toward their own group or members of the dominant
3
group. Anti-social and delinquent behavior may often be
interpreted as reactions to these racial frustrations. These reactions are self-destructive in that the larger society not only punishes those who commit them, but often interprets such aggressive and anti-social behavior as justification for continuing prejudice and segregation.
Middle class and upper class minority group children are likely to react to their racial frustrations and conflicts by withdrawal and submissive behavior. Or, they may react with compensatory and rigid conformity to the prevailing middle class values and standards and an aggressive deter- mination to succeed in these terms in spite of the handicap of their minority status.
The report indicates that minority group children of all social and economic classes often react with a generally defeatist attitude and a lowering of personal ambitions. This, for example, is reflected in a lowering of pupil morale and a depression of the educational aspiration level among minority group children in segregated schools. In produc- ing such effects, segregated schools impair the ability of the child to profit from the educational opportunities pro- vided him.
Many minority group children of all classes also tend to be hypersensitive and anxious about their relations with the larger society. They tend to see hostility and rejection even in those areas where these might not actually exist.
The report concludes that while the range of individ- ual differences among members of a rejected minority group is as wide as among other peoples, the evidence suggests that all of these children are unnecessarily encum- bered in some ways by segregation and its concomitants.
With reference to the impact of segregation and its concomitants on children of the majority group, the report indicates that the effects are somewhat more obscure. Those children who learn the prejudices of our society are also being taught to gain personal status in an unrealistic and non-adaptive way. When comparing themselves to members of the minority group, they are not required to evaluate themselves in terms of the more basic standards of actual personal ability and achievement. The culture per- mits and, at times, encourages them to direct their feelings of hostility and aggression against whole groups of people the members of which are perceived as weaker than them- selves. They often develop patterns of guilt feelings, ratio- nalizations and other mechanisms which they must use in an attempt to protect themselves from recognizing the essential injustice of their unrealistic fears and hatreds of minority groups.4
The report indicates further that confusion, conflict, moral cynicism, and disrespect for authority may arise in majority group children as a consequence of being taught the moral, religious and democratic principles of the broth- erhood of man and the importance of justice and fair play by the same persons and institutions who, in their support of racial segregation and related practices, seem to be acting in a prejudiced and discriminatory manner. Some individuals may attempt to resolve this conflict by intensi- fying their hostility toward the minority group. Others may react by guilt feelings which are not necessarily reflected in more humane attitudes toward the minority group. Still others react by developing an unwholesome, rigid, and uncritical idealization of all authority figures—their par- ents, strong political and economic leaders. As described in The Authoritarian Personality,5 they despise the weak, while they obsequiously and unquestioningly conform to the demands of the strong whom they also, paradoxically, subconsciously hate.
With respect to the setting in which these difficulties
develop, the report emphasized the role of the home, the
6
school, and other social institutions. Studies have shown
that from the earliest school years children are not only aware of the status differences among different groups in the society but begin to react with the patterns described above.

Conclusions similar to those reached by the Mid- century White House Conference Report have been stated by other social scientists who have concerned themselves with this problem. The following are some examples of these conclusions:
Segregation imposes upon individuals a distorted
7 sense of social reality.
Segregation leads to a blockage in the communications
and interaction between the two groups. Such blockages tend
8 to increase mutual suspicion, distrust and hostility.
Segregation not only perpetuates rigid stereotypes and
reinforces negative attitudes toward members of the other
group, but also leads to the development of a social climate
within which violent outbreaks of racial tensions are likely
9 to occur.
We return now to the question, deferred earlier, of what it is about the total society complex of which segre- gation is one feature that produces the effects described above—or, more precisely, to the question of whether we can justifiably conclude that, as only one feature of a complex social setting, segregation is in fact a significantly contributing factor to these effects.
To answer this question, it is necessary to bring to bear the general fund of psychological and sociological knowledge concerning the role of various environmental influences in producing feelings of inferiority, confusions in personal roles, various types of basic personality struc- tures and the various forms of personal and social disorganization.
On the basis of this general fund of knowledge, it seems likely that feelings of inferiority and doubts about personal worth are attributable to living in an underprivi- leged environment only insofar as the latter is itself per- ceived as an indicator of low social status and as a symbol of inferiority. In other words, one of the important deter- minants in producing such feelings is the awareness of social status difference. While there are many other factors that serve as reminders of the differences in social status, there can be little doubt that the fact of enforced segrega-
10 tion is a major factor.
This seems to be true for the following reasons among others: (1) because enforced segregation results from the decision of the majority group without the consent of the segregated and is commonly so perceived; and (2) because historically segregation patterns in the United States were developed on the assumption of the inferiority of the segregated.
In addition, enforced segregation gives official recog- nition and sanction to these other factors of the social complex, and thereby enhances the effects of the latter in creating the awareness of social status differences and
11
feelings of inferiority. The child who, for example, is
compelled to attend a segregated school may be able to

cope with ordinary expressions of prejudice by regarding the prejudiced person as evil or misguided; but he cannot readily cope with symbols of authority, the full force of the authority of the State—the school or the school board, in this instance—in the same manner. Given both the ordinary expression of prejudice and the school’s policy of segre- gation, the former takes on greater force and seemingly becomes an official expression of the latter.
Not all of the psychological traits which are com- monly observed in the social complex under discussion can be related so directly to the awareness of status differenc- es—which in turn is, as we have already noted, materially contributed to by the practices of segregation. Thus, the low level of aspiration and defeatism so commonly ob- served in segregated groups is undoubtedly related to the level of self-evaluation; but it is also, in some measure, related among other things to one’s expectations with re- gard to opportunities for achievement and, having achieved, to the opportunities for making use of these achievements. Similarly, the hypersensitivity and anxiety displayed by many minority group children about their relations with the larger society probably reflects their awareness of status differences; but it may also be influ- enced by the relative absence of opportunities for equal status contact which would provide correctives for prevail- ing unrealistic stereotypes.
The preceding view is consistent with the opinion stated by a large majority (90%) of social scientists who replied to a questionnaire concerning the probable effects of enforced segregation under conditions of equal facilities. This opinion was that, regardless of the facilities which are provided, enforced segregation is psychologically detri-
12 mental to the members of the segregated group.
Similar considerations apply to the question of what features of the social complex of which segregation is a part contribute to the development of the traits which have been observed in majority group members. Some of these are probably quite closely related to the awareness of status differences, to which, as has already been pointed out, segregation makes a material contribution. Others have a more complicated relationship to the total social setting. Thus, the acquisition of an unrealistic basis for self-evalu- ation as a consequence of majority group membership probably reflects fairly closely the awareness of status differences. On the other hand, unrealistic fears and hatreds of minority groups, as in the case of the converse phenom-

enon among minority group members, are probably signif- icantly influenced as well by the lack of opportunities for equal status contact.
With reference to the probable effects of segregation
under conditions of equal facilities on majority group mem-
bers, many of the social scientists who responded to the
poll in the survey cited above felt that the evidence is less
convincing than with regard to the probable effects of such
segregation on minority group members, and the effects are
possibly less widespread. Nonetheless, more than 80%
stated it as their opinion that the effects of such segregation
are psychologically detrimental to the majority group
13 members.
It may be noted that many of these social scientists supported their opinions on the effects of segregation on both majority and minority groups by reference to one or another or to several of the following four lines of pub-
14
lished and unpublished evidence. First, studies of chil-
dren throw light on the relative priority of the awareness of status differentials and related factors as compared to the awareness of differences in facilities. On this basis, it is possible to infer some of the consequences of segregation as distinct from the influence of inequalities of facilities. Second, clinical studies and depth interviews throw light on the genetic sources and causal sequences of various pat- terns of psychological reaction; and, again, certain infer- ences are possible with respect to the effects of segregation per se. Third, there actually are some relevant but relatively rare instances of segregation with equal or even superior facilities, as in the cases of certain Indian reservations. Fourth, since there are inequalities of facilities in racially and ethnically homogeneous groups, it is possible to infer the kinds of effects attributable to such inequalities in the absence of effects of segregation and, by a kind of subtrac- tion to estimate the effects of segregation per se in situa- tions where one finds both segregation and unequal facilities.
Segregation is at present a social reality. Questions may be raised, therefore, as to what are the likely conse- quences of desegregation.
One such question asks whether the inclusion of an intellectually inferior group may jeopardize the education of the more intelligent group by lowering educational stan- dards or damage the less intelligent group by placing it in a situation where it is at a marked competitive disadvan- tage. Behind this question is the assumption, which is examined below, that the presently segregated groups ac- tually are inferior intellectually.
The available scientific evidence indicates that much, perhaps all, of the observable differences among various racial and national groups may be adequately explained in
15
terms of environmental differences. It has been found, for
instance, that the differences between the average intelli-
gence test scores of Negro and white children decrease, and
the overlap of the distributions increases, proportionately to
the number of years that the Negro children have lived in
16
the North. Related studies have shown that this change
cannot be explained by the hypothesis of selective migra-
17
tion. It seems clear, therefore, that fears based on the
assumption of innate racial differences in intelligence are not well founded.
It may also be noted in passing that the argument regarding the intellectual inferiority of one group as com- pared to another is, as applied to schools, essentially an argument for homogeneous groupings of children by intel- ligence rather than by race. Since even those who believe that there are innate differences between Negroes and whites in America in average intelligence grant that con- siderable overlap between the two groups exists, it would follow that it may be expedient to group together the superior whites and Negroes, the average whites and Ne- groes, and so on. Actually, many educators have come to doubt the wisdom of class groupings made homogeneous solely on the basis of intelligence.18 Those who are op- posed to such homogeneous grouping believe that this type of segregation, too, appears to create generalized feelings of inferiority in the child who attends a below average class, leads to undesirable emotional consequences in the education of the gifted child, and reduces learning oppor- tunities which result from the interaction of individuals with varied gifts.
A second problem that comes up in an evaluation of the possible consequences of desegregation involves the question of whether segregation prevents or stimulates interracial tension and conflict and the corollary question of whether desegregation has one or the other effect.
The most direct evidence available on this problem comes from observations and systematic study of instances in which desegregation has occurred. Comprehensive re-
19
views of such instances clearly establish the fact that
desegregation has been carried out successfully in a variety of situations although outbreaks of violence had been com- monly predicted. Extensive desegregation has taken place without major incidents in the armed services in both Northern and Southern installations and involving officers and enlisted men from all parts of the country, including

the South.20 Similar changes have been noted in housing21
22
and industry. During the last war, many factories both in
the North and South hired Negroes on a non-segregated, non-discriminatory basis. While a few strikes occurred, refusal by management and unions to yield quelled all
23 strikes within a few days.
Relevant to this general problem is a comprehensive study of urban race riots which found that race riots oc- curred in segregated neighborhoods, whereas there was no violence in sections of the city where the two races lived, worked and attended school together.24
Under certain circumstances desegregation not only proceeds without major difficulties, but has been observed to lead to the emergence of more favorable attitudes and friendlier relations between races. Relevant studies may be
25 26
cited with respect to housing, employment, the armed
27 28 29 services and merchant marine, recreation agency, and
30 general community life.
Much depends, however, on the circumstances under which members of previously segregated groups first come in contact with others in unsegregated situations. Available evidence suggests, first, that there is less likelihood of unfriendly relations when the change is simultaneously introduced into all units of a social institution to which it is applicable— e.g., all of the schools in a school system or all
31
of the shops in a given factory. When factories introduced
Negroes in only some shops but not in others the prejudiced workers tended to classify the desegregated shops as infe- rior, “Negro work.” Such objections were not raised when complete integration was introduced.
The available evidence also suggests the importance
of consistent and firm enforcement of the new policy by
32
those in authority. It indicates also the importance of such
factors as: the absence of competition for a limited number
33
of facilities or benefits; the possibility of contacts which
permit individuals to learn about one another as individu-
34
als; and the possibility of equivalence of positions and
functions among all of the participants within the unsegre- gated situation.35 These conditions can generally be satis- fied in a number of situations, as in the armed services, public housing developments, and public schools.
The problem with which we have here attempted to deal is admittedly on the frontiers of scientific knowledge. Inevitably, there must be some differences of opinion among us concerning the conclusiveness of certain items of evidence, and concerning the particular choice of words and placement of emphasis in the preceding statement. We are nonetheless in agreement that this statement is substan- tially correct and justified by the evidence, and the differ- ences among us, if any, are of a relatively minor order and would not materially influence the preceding conclusions.

HAT are the prospects for the science Wand profession of psychology during the present decade? What are some of the influences that will affect our Association, per- haps in ways we would not choose if we were able
to plan our own course?
First of all, what will be the size of APA by
that we will fulfill Boring's prophesy for the year 2050. Indeed, I do not believe we will reach the 40,000-44,000 estimate for 1970.
Psychology's growth curve may reach an asymp- tote fairly soon and perhaps even before we reach the 30,000 figure. If we assume that 6% of psy- chologists withdraw from the field each year, we would need 1,800 annual replacements just to main-
1970? There are many ways to estimate a profes-
sion's growth. Fifteen years ago, Dael Wolfle tain a membership of 30,000. A 6°/o figure was the
(1947) estimated that the total membership of the American Psychological Association would be 16,000 by 1960 and 40,000 by 1970 if growth continued in the straight line it had followed from 1920 to 1947. Boring (see Sanford, 19S1) plotted a curve four years later that led him to predict almost 18,000 psychologists in APA by 1960, almost 44,000 by 1970, and almost 59,000,000 psychologists in 2050! Our actual membership in 1960 was 18,215.
foresee how we can expand doctoral programs be- yond the projections noted below. Unless there is a large expansion in Master's level programs during this decade, and an active effort to recruit these graduates, it seems probable that APA will stabi- lize at about 30,000 members.
I have used several methods to predict the mem-
bership of APA in 1970, but all seem open to ques-
tion. Our growth curve has been decelerating, but
a great expansion of college enrolments and gradu- will not be likely to exceed 1,200. It is hard to
ate school applications is in prospect. These anti-
thetical trends cloud the crystal ball. One method
of estimating future trends is to divide the number
of PhD degrees in psychology year by year over
the past several years into the increment in APA
membership for the same year. This gives a ratio
which should show short-range stability as extrane-
ous factors, such as the postwar degree boom, have
decreased effect. The ratios of new PhDs to APA rive at what seems a fairly accurate estimate. We
membership increments has dropped rather steadily from year to year. There is a choice of using a larger number of years and an average higher than the current ratio, or a smaller number of recent years to be sure the decreasing ratio is taken into account. Using both these methods, with United States Office of Education estimates of doctorates in the 1960s (Conger &amp; Fullam, 1959), I have ar- rived at an anticipated APA membership in 1970 between 30,000 and 33,000.
Our APA membership increased two and a half times in the decade 1950 to 1960. As our growth curve is steadily decelerating it does not seem likely
have exact figures on the total output of doctorates in the United States in all fields during the 1950s and on the output of PhDs in psychology for the same period. For these past 10 years the number of PhDs in psychology was almost exactly 6^°/o of total doctorates earned in all fields. Using the United States Office of Education estimates of the number of doctor's degrees to be awarded in the 1960s, and assuming that 6|% will continue to rep- resent the proportion in psychology, we can make yearly estimates of our output. Adding these yearly estimates we arrive at a total of 9,200 PhDs to be awarded in psychology during the current
90
best estimate of the rate of annual loss of college faculty members that could be made by the Re- search Division of the National Education Associa- tion (1961, p. 53) after a broad survey of existing information. It includes death, retirement, illness and disability, change of occupation, etc. It is hard to argue that our rate of loss will be any slower than 6% because of our higher proportion of women and our relatively higher than average tendency to leave the field for administrative and managerial positions.
The PhD output of our graduate schools by 1970
What will be the output of our graduate psy- chology programs during the 1960s? We can ar-
￼decade. Now let us see what demands there will be for these people.
How many new college and university faculty members in psychology will be required in the 1960s? Ten years ago, a fair number of aca- demic disciplines were able to boast that at least half of their new college teachers had the doctoral degree. Along with psychology, more than half of all new teachers in the biological sciences and the physical sciences had received the PhD. Now psy- chology is the only academic field still above the 50% level. There has been a sharp decrease in the educational qualifications of college teachers in most fields, but especially in mathematics, English, and foreign languages.
There has been a growing demand for new faculty members in psychology. In 195S, 144 new full- time psychology teachers were employed in our colleges and universities. By 1960 this number had increased to 250. In 1961 the figure jumped to 320. In 1965, using a prediction method de- scribed below, we can estimate a need for approxi- mately 800 new faculty members in psychology and this number will continue to increase somewhat year by year thereafter.
In the first year of this decade the increase in college and university enrolments was 230,000. Each year enrolment in our higher educational in- stitutions will gain a little more than it did the year before until by 1970 the increase over 1969 will be 300,000 students. By 1970 well over 6,000,000 college students will be jammed into our colleges and universities. The 1960 enrolment was about 3,500,000.
In estimating the number of full-time faculty needed in higher educational institutions, the Re- search Division of the National Educational Asso- ciation (1961) used 6% as their estimate of the annual number of new faculty members needed to replace present faculty members who die, retire, or leave teaching. But this does not cover the in- creased enrolments.
This enrolment problem is causing uncertainty in estimates of future need for college faculty mem- bers. What is the extent to which increased en- rolments will be permitted to stretch student- faculty ratios? In estimating future needs for faculty, the Research Division of the National Edu- cation Association has arbitrarily assumed that some faculty expansion would have to occur but that we could not keep up with enrolments; per-
haps we will hold the student-faculty ratios to about a 20% increase.
Using these National Education Association esti- mates we can predict a real demand for 7,500 new college and university faculty members in psychol- ogy in the 1960s.
How many nonacademic psychologists will we need in this decade? If we continue to use 6% as the rate of attrition due to death, retirement, and other causes, and if we assume that we will find further demand in the nonacademic fields of psy- chology in proportion to the increase in the United States population, we can predict a need for 8,000 to 10,000 psychologists in nonacademic positions during the current decade.
It will be obvious that we are not going to pro- duce as many PhDs as the number of psychologists estimated as our minimum requirements. But if only half the total of new teachers and nonacade- micians are PhDs, we will come out even.
From this supply we will have to furnish addi- tional people to the growing option of private prac- tice. Nearly all of these will be new (or used) PhDs.
Let us look for a moment at the forces affecting private practice, particularly in clinical psychology. Just as public support of clinical psychology has
resulted in a marked increase in the number of clinical psychologists available, it seems safe to pre- dict that the public's growing and obvious willing- ness to support with fees psychologists in private practice will result in a sizeable increase in the number of clinical psychologists electing to enter this field.
How many psychologists are now in full-time private practice? While there is no answer to this question for the country as a whole, we have a number of sources of data which allow us to make estimates. Recently I had a student count the number of individual psychologists who list them- selves in the Yellow Pages of telephone directories in our 10 largest cities. Some 650 psychologists are so listed.
E. Lowell Kelly's (1960) recent survey of Divi- sion 12 membership found that 17% of his respond- ents reported private practice as their primary work setting. If this percentage of his sample can be extrapolated to the Division 12 membership as a whole this would mean that more than 400 mem- bers of Division 12 are engaged in relatively full- time private practice. Division 12 represents only
PSYCHOLOGY IN THE SIXTIES 91
￼92 AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGIST
about one-third of the clinical psychologists who belong to APA. Continuing the extrapolation we arrive at an estimate of some 1,200 APA members (6% of the total membership) as the number in full-time private practice in clinical psychology. This is a very shaky estimate, of course, based on an extrapolation from an extrapolation. But it is the best guess we can make without much better data, and it does not differ appreciably from the 5% figure usually cited by the APA Central Office.
What are some of the factors responsible for the present and anticipated future growth in the num- ber of psychologists entering private practice? One reason, of course, is simply the fact that there are more psychologists than there used to be, and there will be more from year to year for awhile.
Other factors are also important. Our United States population is becoming more and more ur- banized and the private practice of clinical psy- chology is an urban phenomenon. Indeed profes- sional activities of all sorts are concentrated in urban areas. Psychologists turn out to be even more urbanized than physicians. In our 10 most highly urbanized states live 38% of our population, 43% of all MDs, and 55% of all APA members.
The principal reason for the growth in private practice of clinical psychology probably will be found in the acute and growing shortage of other professionals available to meet mental health de- mands of our middle and upper classes, particularly the shortage of psychiatrists. Elsewhere (Albee, 1959) I have shown in detail the fact that psy- ciatry is falling behind. Certainly our output of psychiatrists cannot be much expanded because this medical specialty is competing with other highly rewarded medical specialties for recruits from the limited pool of medical school graduates. As there is no immediate prospect of any sizable increase in the output of our medical schools and as psychi- atry will continue to recruit something less than 9% of the approximately 7,200 new medical gradu- ates each year, psychiatry cannot keep up with our growing population and with the need for replace- ment of those who leave the field.
Similar prospective shortages can be cited for other mental health fields. For example, there is a continuing manpower shortage in professional so- cial work and among clergymen of most religious denominations. All of these shortages seem des- tined to be chronic and to operate as a vacuum into
which private practitioners of clinical psychology inevitably will move.
Because the shortage of psychiatrists is likely to have such far-reaching implications for psychology we should look more closely at what is happening in psychiatry. In 1950 there were some 1,400 psy- chiatric residents in training in United States men- tal hospitals. By the end of the decade this num- ber had doubled. This sounds like a very sizeable increase. But in 1950 only 10% of the residents in psychiatric training were graduates of foreign medi- cal schools. By the end of the decade more than 40% of this group were from abroad. Two-thirds of the total of residents in our state hospitals are foreign trained. Often the attitude of the hospitals has been that it is better to have someone than no one. Recently the American Medical Association has raised serious question about this attitude with the result that qualifying examinations have now
been set up for foreign physicians to measure their competence in medical knowledge and in English. After December 31, 1960, all foreign physicians have had to be certified by the Educational Coun- cil for Foreign Medical Graduates.
Despite the sizable number of foreign physicians in residency training in this country, some 11 states in 1960 had no one in training in psychiatry. Ten additional states had fewer than 10 psychiatrists in training. In 22 of our states the public mental hos- pitals had not a solitary resident in training in psy- chiatry (American Psychiatric Association &amp; Na- tional Association for Mental Health, 1959). What do these figures mean? The number of psychia- trists available to that part of our population living in rural states, and to those hospitalized in public mental hospitals, is desperately short.
Of those psychiatrists in residency training across the country only some 800 were reported to be in their third year of training. All this simply means that we are not getting enough well-trained psy- chiatrists to meet our growing mental health de- mands. It is unfortunate, but true, that the fu- ture development of psychology is more likely to be influenced by this shortage in psychiatry than by any other single factor (save perhaps the teach- ing machine).
The increase in demand for private practitioners may affect the incomes of all psychologists. Gal- braith (1958) has pointed out that those profes- sions having the option of private sale of services are in a much better economic position than those
￼in which the private practice option does not exist. Economically speaking one is much better off to be a dentist or a prostitute than a librarian or a so- cial worker! Even during periods of increased de- mand for professional services, charges for privately supplied services are likely to go up rather than down. With long-time endemic inflation a charac- teristic of our society, those professions with a siz- able proportion of their members in private prac- tice can adjust much more readily than strictly salaried professions to the increased costs of living. And even those professionals not electing the option of private practice must be better paid by agencies
in order to be held.
We have evidence that this economic law is be-
ginning to operate in psychology. Kelly's (1961) survey of Division 12 indicated that the median of male Fellows was over $14,000 a year and of female Fellows over $10,000 a year. These incomes are higher than the median income of psychologists in the National Register of Scientific and Technical Personnel (mostly PhD) reported by Levine (1961) to be about $9,000 a year.
Recently I did a mail survey of the Cleveland Psychological Association's Division of Psycholo- gists in Private Practice. I asked members of the group to report to me anonymously their gross pro- fessional income, and the proportion of their time they spent in private practice. For those respond- ing (85% of the group) median income last year was $17,500. The half-time private practice group earned $19,000, the full-time group $14,500.
The point I am making here is that all psycholo- gists, wherever employed, will tend to enjoy con- tinued improvement in their income because of the willingness of society to pay for the services of ap- plied psychologists, including those in private clini- cal practice. As this option grows, all our incomes will grow. Likewise, as sizable numbers of psy- chologists come to earn $20,000 a year, our social image, our power, our influence, and our conserva- tism will increase!
One of the difficulties with manpower estimates is that so often they merely project present trends and present ratios into the future, taking into ac- count population growth, increasing urbanization, and similar obvious factors.
Often they fail to take into account significant events which turn out to have a marked influence on future needs for professional personnel. The dis- covery of an antibiotic all but eliminated an entire
specialty area in medicine and created a whole new science. The recommendations of a Conant can go far towards eliminating the small high school, but can sharply increase the demand for counselors.
Many people predict that the publication of the final report of the Joint Commission on Mental Ill- ness and Health (1961) may prove to be such a pivot point in the whole field of mental health.
What are some of the implications of the recom- mendations contained in the Joint Commission's final report as they affect psychology and other mental health professions?
Many of the recommendations concentrate on the needs for intensified support of research, augmented treatment facilities, stepped-up care of the mentally disordered in general, and revolutionary changes in our present approach to mentally disordered per- sons. Nearly every one of these recommendations requires that we first break through the barrier of limited educational resources for professional man- power. While there are few signs that we are ready to make this effort now, it seems possible that the report will prepare the ground for a change in the social climate and we may witness a major effort to produce the professionals that do not now exist to implement the recommendations.
What are some of the specific recommendations that could affect psychology?
One recommendation concerned psychiatric units in general hospitals. The report expressed the point of view that no community general hospital of more than 100 beds is complete without a psychiatric unit. The fact is that at present only about some 600 general hospitals have any facilities for the care of mental patients beyond emergency admis- sions. This means that there are some 4,000 gen- eral hospitals in the country without such units. If we assume that a psychiatric unit in a general hospital would require the services of at least a half-time psychiatrist, a social worker, and a half- time psychologist, we begin to get some flavor of the personnel demands that would result from at- tempts to realize this particular recommendation.
Another recommendation is concerned with com- munity mental health clinics. The Joint Commis- sion recommended the modest objective of one fully staffed full-time mental health clinic to each 50,000 of our population. This certainly does not seem like an excessive goal until we consider how many professional people would be required to staff the clinics to meet this goal. Using the most conserva-

live estimate of our 1965 population it would take an additional 2,200 psychiatrists, 2,500 psycholo- gists and 5,200 psychiatric social workers to bring us up to this ratio for the whole United States. But there is one further difficulty. Because of the large number of our professional people located in highly urbanized states, and because of the pres- ent severe shortage of professional people in rural states, a much larger number of professionals would be needed to bring all of the states up to this goal than to bring up the country's average as a whole. While it is almost senseless to cite such figures, it would take nearly half of the professionalmember- ship of APA, the American Psychiatric Association, and the National Association of Social Workers to bring all of our states up to this modest goal jor mental hygiene clinics alone. (Of course, this num- ber would be increased if we decided to bring each county up to this desired ratio.)
Several other recommendations of the Joint Com- mission also would require enormous increases in personnel for realization. The needs of chronic public hospitals, children's clinics, intensive treat- ment centers, and follow-up care, all covered in the recommendations, increase manpower needs almost beyond meaning.
At the head of the list of recommendations was the proposal that a much larger proportion of funds for mental health be invested in basic research as contrasted with applied research.
If we must choose among the recommendations or assign priorities, in view of both the manpower picture and pure logic I would underline the neces- sity of making the painful decision to concentrate on training research personnel rather than treat- ment personnel. But most winds seem to be blow- ing in the other direction!
John Gordon, who was co-author of one of the Joint Commission reports, said in another context a few years ago,
No mass disease of man has ever been adequately con- trolled by attempts to treat the affected individual. Some progress can be made, there are ethical reasons for that approach, but if the objective is control of the condition in the population the fundamental approach is through defi- nition of the nature and extent of the problem, the recog- nition of causative factors, and prevention. A program based on treatment of the exaggerated illness is temporiz- ing and with no great promise of productive results; it is good clinical medicine but poor public health (Gordon, 1956).
It is obvious that simply producing more profes- sional people prepared as therapists from our gradu- ate schools and professional schools does not guar- antee the realization of the objectives outlined in the Joint Commission's report. If large numbersof our newly trained professional people go into pri- vate practice with middle-aged neurotics in high- income suburbs, doubling our output will be rela- tively meaningless.
We are torn between a humanitarian desire to do something to help present day neurotics and psy- chotics and the rational decision that only by re- search can we achieve our goal of reducing suffer- ing. Attempts to solve the problem of mental dis- order through approaches based on one-to-one, face- to-face relationships, however moral and admirable, are simply not sensible from a manpower point of view.
Sensible or not, the growth in psychology con- tinues to be in the direction of application rather than basic research.
The very rapid increase in the number of stu- dents entering graduate work in psychology has been accompanied by a concurrent change in the flavor and content of our undergraduate curriculum, thus influencing the self-selection of future gradu- ate students.
The self-selection that had led undergraduatesin the past to major in psychology, and has thereby provided the pool from which graduate students have been recruited, has occurred through the screen of a relatively difficult undergraduate curriculum. There is evidence that this situation is changing. In many ways, in many places, the undergraduate program in psychology has sacrificed rigor and diffi- culty in favor of interest and humanism.
Recently I had a graduate student tally some of the content of five introductory textbooks in wide- spread use today and contrast their content with five texts used 25 years ago. Briefly we found that present day introductory psychology textbooks have more than five times as many references to such "interesting" topics as dreams, hypnosis, neuro- sis, psychosis, and psychotherapy, as the text- books of the 1930s. Our modern texts, despite their greater length, have doubled the proportion of pages devoted to personality, conflict, mental disorder, and adjustment. Twenty-five years ago only one text in five mentioned psychoses or psychotherapy. Today, nearly all of our introductory texts go into detail on these topics.
￼Because our undergraduate majors are, in large measure, self-selected as a result of exposure to be- ginning courses, it seems probable that our future recruits will be of different interest patterns and motivations because of the changing appeal in our subject matter emphasis. This change in the in- terest pattern of future psychologists will undoubt- edly be reflected in changes in graduate programs in the direction of more emphasis on methods and techniques of diagnosis and therapy and decreased emphasis on research.
The increase in interest in diagnosis and therapy will lead to a change in the emphasis of job activi- ties of psychologists with further effects on our image. A very small proportion of the Division 12 clinical psychologists surveyed by Kelly reported a primary interest in research. Only one-tenth of them were occupied primarily in research and only one-fourth of the group reported any research ac- tivities. Seventy-five percent were not doing any research! Who will argue that this situation will not affect eventually the content and emphasis of
graduate education?
Nearly 40% of the clinical psychologists Kelly
surveyed thought the next generation of psycholo- gists should be trained in a special degree program combining parts of medicine, psychology, and social work! It is doubtful that this group would agree with the recommendations of the Miami conference emphasizing the primacy of research preparation.
Finally, we are likely to witness an increase in the presently growing interest in legislation, and public relations, and in such professional matters as malpractice insurance, tax deductibility of psy- chological therapy, and strengthened professional
organization. Where will it all end! Eventually we may hear our APA Executive Officer testifying before the Congress against every piece of legisla- tion that smacks of socialized psychology! We will engage in cocktail party defenses of the in- alienable right of every citizen to choose his own psychologist without government interference.

            <Text>￼A Question of Values
Having read K. E. Clark's America's Psychologists and the recent statement by Division 12 of the new requirement for fellowship status of "a significant con- tribution," we were impressed with the fact that either intentionally or unintentionally values are playing an increasingly significant role in determining the criteria which will be selected as appropriate for assessing the status of professional psychologists.
It is interesting to note in this connection that in Clark's book much emphasis is given to research publi- cation as a means of differentiating "significant con- tributors" from their ostensibly less productive col- leagues. It is apparent that discrimination on this basis has the advantages of objectivity and ease of determi- nation. There are certainly other equally important criteria, however difficult to measure, which the clinical psychologist might suggest: such as skill in diagnosis and therapy, number of patients benefited through treat- ment, direct and indirect contributions to the solution of mental hygiene problems in the community. The teacher of psychology would, we think, have still other pertinent criteria which he might consider of major import: such as the number of students toward whose education he has substantially contributed, the number of students he has motivated to pursue further study in psychology, and contributions to mental health through informal counseling.
The point we are trying to make is that a value system to a large extent determines what functions or productions are to be considered worthy and thus tends to sustain them. It should be remembered that Clark's book addresses itself, not only to research psychologists, but to the entire profession as well as to any other in- terested intelligent reader. Surely some consideration could have been given to other professional endeavors which are of significance to a large number of psychol- ogists. It is recognized that Clark and his co-workers cannot be criticized for delimiting their area of inves- tigation; but, if the book is intended to present infor- mation about all of America's psychologists, then errors of omission can loom as large as errors of commission. Clark himself reports that about three times as many psychologists are members of Division 12 than any other division. Might not some valuable hypotheses, amenable to research investigation, have been forthcom- ing from this large group as well as from the smaller number of psychology teachers? And what about prob- lems that appear significant for which no appropriate methodology currently exists? These oversights or neglect trouble us. We see it as a sign of things to
**
come; perhaps, the structure of the APA may be seri- ously threatened.
Even Division 12 seems to be suffering from this same (unrecognized?) conflict. New fellows will have to have made an "outstanding contribution" to psychology. Will these contributions be limited to those which can be reliably and validly investigated, leaving the impor- tant service and teaching functions to be relegated to secondary importance because of the difficulty in estab- lishing valid criteria for their assessment? Or is it to be a long list of (significant?) publications that will be the summum bonum? Was it W. S. Maugham in his Summing Up who said that writing a book was inher- ently no more valuable an activity than plowing a field? The value lies in the eyes of the doer (and perhaps in the contribution to others).
We might add that this question of values pervades many diverse areas in psychology, including psycho- metric assessment and teaching. In "Comments on Meehl and Rosen's Paper" (Psychol. Bull., 19S6, 53, 335-337) by S. Karson and S. B. Sells, essentially the same problem was raised. Certain remarks by S. L. Pressey in "Teaching in the Ivory Tower, with Rarely a Step Outside" (Psychol. Bull, 1955, 52, 343-344) are especially relevant. Although his plea is for a wider range of experiment in teaching evaluation studies, his words (p. 344) are noteworthy:
Climb higher in the ivory tower! Why not instead come down and open the door, watch what students do outside class, see what psychologists are doing in the wide world, and even venture off campus occasionally, to mix with the folks on Main Street.

A Reply
The comments of Karson, Baler, and Carroll suggest that the planning of the program of research reported in America's Psychologists intentionally or unintention- ally was influenced by value judgments. What they mean to say, obviously, is that they believe the wrong values were assigned, especially in the study of factors influencing an individual psychologist's research contri- butions to psychology. I gather that Karson, Baler, and Carroll would rather have had us study the contri- bution of individual psychologists to the solution of individual and society problems. I would like to see somebody make such a study; I do no.t believe Amer- ica's Psychologists should be criticized for having done

a different type of study than this, nor should it be concluded that we avoided use of clinical criteria simply because they were too difficult to assess.
The emphasis given to research publication, to which Karson, Baler, and Carroll object, occurred in our study of the way in which significant contributors dif- fered from their less productive colleagues. Attention to publication was essential, we felt, since any contri- bution to science necessarily involves comunication with one's fellows about results. The service a therapist gives to his client may be a great contribution to the
America's Psychologists did give consideration to other professional endeavors. One chapter deals with the comparative characteristics of clinical psychologists and of psychologists in other areas of specialization. Another includes a survey of private practice in clin- ical psychology in Los Angeles. Both of these studies involve no evaluation of the individual clinician, but still provide useful insights into the nature of contribu- tions being made by these persons.
Of course, we were dealing with values in making decisions about the way to proceed in the study of client, but it is not communicated to other psychol- American psychology. Our responsibility was to rec-
ogists. Likewise, the therapist may gain great skill in ognize what values we held and to make them explicit
his work and become an exceedingly capable person; but, unless he has some method, either in the training of others or through his writing, to convey what he has learned to his colleagues, he has not made a contribu- tion to psychology. Our study included in the signifi- cant contributor group a substantial number of clinical psychologists. These persons might have been nom- inated either because of their writing or because of the substantial training programs they directed for clinical psychologists, but not solely because they were excel- lent therapists. Note our directions to raters:
One of the studies being conducted under Project B is an investigation of factors influencing the productivity of research psychologists. Part of this study involves the de- velopment of a small sample of persons considered by their colleagues to have made significant research contributions in psychology, either through their own original work, or through their part in training research workers, this sample to be drawn from a larger roster of persons who have be- come "visible" to their colleagues through substantial con- tributions to the research literature. . . .
You are asked to nominate those persons whom you con- sider to have made the most significant contributions to psychology as a science, cither through scientific work of their own, or through their work in the training of research psychologists.
in our account. What these values were is revealed to any careful reader through the detailed procedures em- ployed in our study. In this respect, our study is no different from any other experimental investigation. While we were not willing to stop with a study that directed its attention only toward the characteristics of research psychologists, we did feel that they deserved primary attention, since the field of psychology can grow and develop only with a continuing increment to knowledge. Many clinical psychologists do not make contributions to science as science is normally defined; that they do make contributions is recognized by all.
I think we need to recognize that all of American psychology is today perplexed about the relative values to assign to research and to service in our growing field. Karson, Baler, and Carroll protest that decisions are being made about the desired characteristics of a clin- ical psychologist on traditional bases without enough attention being given to changing conditions and new roles played by clinical psychologists. For this posi- tion I think they can find full and unqualified support in America's Psychologists.

GEORGE W. ALBEE
Case Western Reserve University
IT is increasingly clear that the current and the prospective professional manpower shortages in the mental health field derive primarily from a set of interacting considerations that go somewhat as follows:
Disturbed and disturbing human behavior cur- rently is "explained" by a conceptual model which attributes causation to "disease" or to some form of "illness." The content of the explanatory model accounting for these sorts of human deviation dic- tates the specific kind of institutional structure which society must support for the delivery of care or intervention. And the nature of the institu- tion in turn dictates the kind of manpower required for its staffing. So we are confronted with a desperate shortage of medical and paramedical pro- fessionals required to staff hospitals, clinics, and centers. This shortage is going to worsen in the
years ahead as the institutional demands proliferate while the manpower supply does not.
Because of the primacy of the disease explanation for disturbed behavior, the largest share of available funds for training and for research is funneled into biomedical programs. These training programs are producing professionals who, after being trained at public expense, do not work primarily with these serious, chronically disturbed people who are the responsibility of tax-supported institutions (Arn- hoff &amp; Shriver, 1967). And, further, the biomedi- cally oriented research programs demanded by the disease model support complex laboratory research studies that have little relevance to the real etio- logical problems of disturbed people.
There is a current, popular platitude which says that the social and behavioral sciences seriously lag the physical and biological sciences in knowl- edge. If only, it is opined, we could make faster progress in behavioral science, if only we could learn as much about the human being as we know already about germs and atoms, then more effec- tive programs could be developed to deal with man's problems with himself and with his fellows.
This reading of the knowledge situation is far from accurate. We do know a great deal in the behavioral sciences, but many of the things we know are threatening to the mental health Establishment and therefore to the status quo. For example, we know very well that the nature of the social world of the infant and child in the family are of primary importance as determinants of subsequent rates of disturbed behavior. Tn our Western culture the stable family is the best bulwark against later be- havioral and emotional disturbance. Efforts at pre- vention of mental disorder should be directed to those social institutions that affect family stability directly or indirectly, positively or negatively. For hopelessly disrupted families we should seek new ways of providing the best possible alterna- tives for the children affected—whether in foster
homes or specially designed institutions like kibbut- zim.
When eventually alternative explanatory models for disturbed behavior are widely tolerated, and institutions based on them supported with public funds are available, there will still be real mental illness to keep busy the organically oriented psy- chiatrist. All of the emotional problems associated with serious central nervous system malfunctioning, seizure states, toxic and endocrinologically induced psychoses, and the problems of organically induced behavioral disturbances in general will be left. But of course these are not the conditions that in- terest contemporary psychiatry, perhaps in part because there is so little token reinforcement with these kinds of cases! Psychotherapy is the pri- mary professional activity in psychiatry, and mild neurotics are the preferred cases.
The mental health establishment has made so many promises to so many groups in our society that it is beyond the wildest manpower dream thai it can begin to supply these services (Albee, 1967). Let me just mention some of these new demands without elaborating them.
The labor unions, particularly the United Auto
￼318
AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGIST
Workers, have negotiated contracts for outpatient psychiatric care for their members and families— more than two and a half million UAW people sud- denly have become eligible for outpatient mental health care. Other unions actively are establishing their own mental health clinics. Once one union docs these things other unions must begin to do them too, and all of these new plans require scarce professional manpower.
Perhaps the single most important recent legisla- tive act in this whole field, so far as manpower de- mand is concerned, was Medicare. Without going through all of the different components of Medi- care, it can be said for sure that an enormous new group of users of mental health services suddenly is eligible for prepaid or insured care. One of the most important parts of Medicare is Title 19, under which anyone defined as "medically indigent," along with their children, is eligible for outpatient psy- chiatric care and other mental health services. There will be very large new demands for profes- sional mental health care under this law.
Nor need we dwell long on the 2,000 new com- prehensive mental health centers that the National Institute of Mental Health promises will be built by 1980 with Federal, state, and local funds. The demand for professional medical and paramedical care in these centers is beyond all hope of realiza- tion. How can the 2,000 centers be staffed when two-thirds of our existing 2,000 psychiatric clinics are without a single full-time psychiatrist, and when little psychiatric care is available in at least one- third of our state hospitals (National Committee against Mental Illness, 1966)?
There is no point in discussing the Appalachian program, although it contains more extensive blue- prints for programs in mental health than the whole Comprehensive Community Mental Health Centers Act!
Nor need there be further elaboration on current manpower shortages in all the other professions represented in the 2,000 existing "psychiatric" clinics, the VA hospitals, the state hospitals, in higher education, etc. The point I hope to leave with you in this recitation of the growing demand for mental health services is this: All of the plans for increasing professional services for the aged, for the union members and their families, for the medically indigent, for the inner-city poor, and for all the others lining up for care—all of these pro- grams arc going to fail because we do not have
enough of the kind of manpower demanded by the disease model of mental disorder.
It is so simple. The explanatory model dictates the kind of professional manpower needed to staff the institutions. This means a current and future need for nonexistent medical and paramedical pro- fessionals. Since 1958, when the Bane report was made to the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare (Bane, 1959), it has been the consensus of all manpower experts that we should be producing at least 11,000 physicians a year in this country, if we are only to stay even in the ratio of physicians to population! But we are not training this num- ber. Currently we are training only 7,500 annually —so, year after year, we fall at least 3,500 new MDs farther behind the number that would be required just to keep our ratio of physicians to population constant. The only possible conclusion is that physicians, and, as a consequence, psychi- atrists, are going to be in even shorter supply, while all of these service demands I sketched a moment ago are mushrooming everywhere.
Elsewhere I have argued that the future avail- able supply of clinical psychologists and social workers is at least as inadequate as the prospective supply in psychiatry (Albee, 1967). The demands for academicians in psychology, for example, can absorb most of the PhDs we produce over the next decade or two. Because psychology is a relatively young profession there has not been a large re- placement demand for faculty members in this field. In other academic fields this replacement figure approaches 6% a year. As psychology pro- fessors continue to age we will need to hire replace- ments in addition to those needed for the expand- ing student enrollments.
Any manpower planning for mental health care as now conceived must confront explicitly these prospective chronic shortages of professionals. If we continue to use the illness model of mental dis- order, we cannot produce a fraction of the medical and paramedical people the model demands. This would not be a sufficient reason for abandoning the illness model, if it were supported firmly by research evidence. But the evidence supporting it is thin indeed. What I am suggesting is that we are in a manpower cul-de-sac because of the con- ceptual model we use. The development of alterna- tive models could lead to new manpower solutions because they would allow for new institutional solu-
￼CONCEPTUAL MODELS AND MANPOWER REQUIREMENTS 319
tions requiring manpower more easily recruited and trained.
Eventually the demands of society will prevail. The times are ripe for new models, for new ideas. We cannot push along this social change unless we develop a new set of concepts, a new conceptual armamentarium, a new language, a new delivery system for service.
This reconceptualization must follow rejection by psychology of the illness model. But it is not simply a matter of blowing a trumpet and seeing the walls collapse! The illness model is sup- ported by powerful forces. There are many rea- sons for its persistence in the field of functional behavior disorder (Albee, 1967).
The model was developed, and it has persisted, because it was more convincing than the sin, taint, or demonic explanations. Also, the early success in finding the spirochete to be the cause of paresis led to hopes that other mental "illnesses" also had similar causes. Further, it seemed more and more as though genetic factors were important. The illness explanation also supported the practice of putting victims out of sight in plague houses until "a cure" was found. Money could be spent on chemical and biological research, without upsetting the value hierarchy in the society. Finally, both family and society could avoid personal responsi- bility for mental disorder. They could blame Fate.
Perhaps, however, the most compelling reason of all for the persistence of this model has been the absence of any alternative model. A scientific model will persist until a more valid and more convincing model appears.
Over the past 20 years there have begun to emerge out of psychotherapy, experimental work in the learning laboratory, cultural anthropology, and social work, to name just a few sources, elements of an explanatory model for disturbed behavior which might be called the social learning theory. This theory argues that most disturbed behavior con- sists of learned operant anxiety-avoiding responses. The origins of the anxiety to be avoided are to be found in traumatic social interaction of infants and children with the parents or parent surrogates. Evidence to support this explanatory model is ac- cumulating in the research literature.
I suggest that as psychologists we have played the illness game for 20 years and this is long enough. The rules of the illness game are such that there will never be enough professional people avail-
able to provide care except to selected members of the middle and upper classes. As long as the ill- ness model occupies the center of the stage, all of the planning, all of the action is going to deal with psychiatric treatment, mental hospital beds, and the Team. Psychology must create its own in- stitutional structure for developing methods for the delivery of service, because only in its own struc- ture can it begin to elaborate this new conceptual model—the dimensions of which I have sketched so briefly—together with the language and the in- tervention methods that eventually will permit peo- ple with a bachelor's degree (or even less educa- tion) to be the line workers in the field of behavioral disorders.
Let me emphasize that I do not see psychology as the care-delivery field. We can never have the manpower to meet the demands. Rather, we must create the theory and show how it is ap- plicable, to enable care to be given by bachelor's level people in habilitation centers that they them- selves administer. Psychology can only be the developer of the conceptual models and of the research underpinning. The parallel with the field of education is evident. Intervention in the educa- tional system is by bachelor's level teachers who are supported by more highly trained research workers from several fields. Only when institutions are built in which BA people can work with dis- turbed or retarded children and adults (perhaps Project Re-ed is the best example of what ] have in mind) will we begin to meet the demand.
Frankly, I find it astonishing that all of us as parents, and as citizens, are willing to send our children to the daily ministrations of school teach- ers trained essentially at the bachelor's level, and yet we insist that professionals dealing with our emotionally disturbed and mentally retarded chil- dren and adults must have far more training than teachers for their face-to-face intervention.
Let us start developing an institutional structure where the rules and language are based on research findings in behavior modification. Let us develop centers where technicians, nonprofessionals, re- habilitation workers of all kinds can be used to maximize human potential. Until we have a con- ceptual assessment system that uses indications of strength we will still be playing the illness game. The new model which I think we must develop will stress the maximization of human effectiveness. I have argued that this model will not be built until
￼320 AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGIST
psychology develops it in its own service delivery setting from which we can also go out into those community agencies where the real problems are.
Once society accepts the position that most, if not all, functionally disturbed behavior represents learned patterns of anxiety avoidance, the institu- tions developed to deal with these conditions may well be educational in nature.
Albert Bandura (1967) has said it well:
The day may not be far off when psychological disorders will be treated not in hospitals or mental hygiene clinics but in comprehensive "learning centers," when clients will be considered not patients suffering from hidden psychic pathologies but responsible people who participate actively in developing their own potentialities [p. 861.
Unless psychology assumes leadership in develop- ing alternatives to the illness model, the mental health manpower picture is going to continue to get worse. We cannot train enough medical and paramedical professionals to meet the manpower needs of hospitals and clinics, but, more important,
we cannot use knowledge already available to deal with the pressing problems of our urbanized, au- tomated antihuman existence.

HERE is something about the aura of the Tterm "presidential address" which makes it a special burden and a special source of anxiety for everyone involved. Every speech, ad- dress, article, or essay exposes an important part of oneself for critical examination by an audience or by readers. For a long time, I have tried to per- suade my students that everything that a person writes—all forms of communication—may be viewed as projective materials which reveal aspects of the totality and the complexity of his personality to sensitive observers. If this is true it would follow that to communicate to psychologists, who view themselves as experts in the analysis of per- sonality and character, is to invite not only an analysis of the substance of what one communicates, but also to expose oneself to probing and critical examination. There must be an incorrigible ego drive which propels one to assume the risks of ex- posure to an audience of psychologists, given the fact that the threat of exposure is greater the more accurate are the judgments concerning the character
and wisdom of the speaker.
There remains the problem of how can one make
a presidential address in some way worth the anxie- ties and risks? One could use it as an opportunity to try to clarify the underlying conceptual frame- work implicit in his thoughts, research, writing, teaching, and social action. In one's personal and professional life, it is possible to move from project to project and from encounter to encounter, and to take on a variety of responsibilities and roles with- out having the time to give thought to the theo-

retical and philosophical perspectives which, hope- fully, unify and give some coherence to one's life and activities. It would be reassuring, especially in the latter stages of one's life, to discover that there is theoretical coherence and unity in one's professional activities and his role as a person and as a citizen.
A search for congruence and consistency among the various aspects of one's being would seem man- datory, if not inevitable, for those who are arrogant enough to use the discipline of psychology to legiti- mize their functioning. The luxury and safety of defining scientific objectivity in terms of a detached, disciplined, isolated, and amoral use of human intelligence are not available to those who have chosen to work in the social, psychological, and be- havior sciences or for that matter in the biological and medical sciences.
The research topics, findings, and analyses and insights of a psychologist cannot be divorced from the total complexity of his being. Psychological phenomena do not seem to consist of absolute reali- ties. Their reality is the tantalizing, persistent reality of the subjective. This fact of relativistic reality differentiates the science of psychology from all other sciences. This difference between psy- chology and the physical sciences remains in spite of the fact that the evidence of all sciences—in- deed, the inevitable basis of all knowledge—must be filtered through the limits of human observa- tional powers and refined by limited human intelli- gence.
Psychologists and other social scientists must seek to organize their findings within a conceptual framework which hopefully will expand knowledge and broaden and deepen insights into the nature of man and his society. There remains, also, for psy- chology, the ultimate test of the validity of all sci- ences, namely, a demonstration of an effective tech- nology—the ability to predict or control the phe- nomena which we purport to understand.

cal questions for a contemporary science of psy- chology and for other behavioral sciences are: What arc their contributions to the understanding and control of the behavior of human beings? How can the knowledge, the insights, and the re- lated technology contribute directly or indirectly to effectiveness of individual human beings, to stabil- ity in human society, and increase the chances of survival of the human species?
These are important questions, and there is now a special urgency in finding and implementing af- firmative answers to them within the context of respect for human values. What follows are the views of a person who has spent his adult life in research, teaching, writing, and social action within the discipline of social psychology as to the basis for and the direction within which humane affirma- tive answers might be found. It is also an at- tempt to share with others the process—the intel- lectual and emotional turbulence—by which these views and related suggestions concerning the dy- namics of man and society emerged.
INFLUKNCK OF EARLY RESEARCH ON DICVKLOPJNG JDKAS
My first serious scientific involvement in the larger theoretical concerns with the nature of man and society emerged as a result of the need to interpret the findings of the early research on the nature and development of the self and the problems of ego and racial identification. In these studies 1 was a collaborator with my wife, Dr. Mamie Clark. This fascinating and somewhat illusive "pure" re- search problem was initially my wife's Master's thesis problem. As she saw the larger implications of the first stages of this work, she was kind enough to invite me to join her in a more probing empirical and theoretical exploration of the nature and determinants of the self-image.
As we collected and analyzed the data obtained through the methods we used, we became im- pressed with the implications of the observation that in the initial stages of the emerging sense of self in children the substance and the dynamics of the functioning ego were determined almost ex- clusively by external pressures, determinants, and evaluative agents. These findings provided the first clues for insights concerning the fragility, vulnera- bility, dependence, indeed, the pathos of the human ego. This early research on the emergence of self-
awareness and preference in Negro children illumi- nated for us the larger pattern of problems related to ego development in human beings. Among these insights were:
• The functional substance of the self is not in- digenous to the human organism, but is determined by the nature and pattern of human interaction as this is influenced by the status of the individual in a familial and social hierarchical system. (By the way the individual is perceived and generally treated.)
• The qualitative effect of the external determi- nants of the individual's sense of self is inevitably evaluative; that is, the resulting emerging self- image inevitably brings with it a positive or nega- tive sense of the worth of self.
• This positive or negative evaluative component of self is inevitable and pivotal—and in its most primary and basic sense is not controlled by the individual himself but by others over whom he has no control.
• In the most formative and susceptible stage of a child's life, that period within which there is the beginning of the ability to cope with ideas, the idea of the self and the worth and status of the self are inextricable.
• This initial external definition of the nature, worth, and status of self tends to persist through- out the life of the individual, in that it is reinforced by consistent experiences, is internalized as the core of personality, and establishes the patterns of defense and protection which the individual uses in interpersonal and other forms of social interaction.
• In spite of the above, human beings—except those who have been totally defeated by negative evaluation of others and by consistent rejection, or those who are organically deficient—persist in the struggle for self-affirmation and the attainment of that minimum self-esteem required to continue to function as a human being. Tt remains one of the mysteries of psychological science that individual human beings differ—whether markedly or mini- mally is still open to question—in the physical equipment, intellectual strengths and general life force, and other personal resources which they can mobilize in the continuing struggle for personal affirmation and an effective self-esteem.
My research on the social and attitudinal factors influencing memory and recall—related to the larger
￼problem of the effect of social factors on percep- tion and cognition—tended to reinforce my ideas concerning the fragility of the human ego. This early study, conducted in partial fulfillment for the doctorate at Columbia University incidentally, not only anticipated some of the later research on cog- nitive styles but also foreshadowed some of the concerns of the Women's Liberation movement in the finding that men and women differed markedly in the recall of the activities of a dominant woman. The finding that human beings tended to recall events in terms consistent with their attitudes and within the context of their personality seemed to
provide further supportive evidence of the human need to use all available sensory and intellective resources in the attempt to obscure the tenuousness of our being—and to assert an inner certainty and absoluteness as having reality and existence pri- marily because they are asserted.
Further studies of the effects of social pressures and the consequences of rejection and acceptance of individuals and groups by the larger society culmi- nated in the publication of Dark Ghetto. While the writing of Dark Ghetto drew on earlier research in- sights, this specific study of the psychological ef- fects of a ghetto community resulted in a more focused picture of the effects of adverse, persistent social negatives on the distortion of personality and on the impairment of psychological effectiveness of the victims of persistent rejection. Here, again, the persistent fact of the fragility and vulnerability of the human ego, somewhat tempered by insights con- cerning the counterstruggle for self-esteem and resilience of human beings, was reinforced by the
findings of this community psychology research.
It may be of some value to point out that the earlier studies of the development of self-identifica-
Ghetto research on the other hand, from its incep- tion, was clearly motivated by the desire to influ- ence social policy and influence the decisions of those with power to facilitate, block, or determine the rate of desired social change. The Dark Ghetto study cannot be described with candor as an exer- cise in "pure" research on a problem of culture and personality. This study of the dynamics of a sys- tematically dehumanizing community on the hu- manity and effectiveness of the personalities con- fined within it was not conducted without concern for the implications of these findings for social jus- tice and social change.
The Harlem Youth Opportunities (HARYOU) report, Youth in the Ghetto, expanded and revised into Dark Ghetto, was modeled after investigations in public health and preventive medicine. These reports did seek to analyze and describe the effects of social policy and practice; diagnose the nature and manifestations of social instability; and sug- gested remedies for the persistent social insensitivi- ties and resulting pathologies which robbed human beings of self-esteem, reinforced negative self-im- ages, and destroyed the chances of personal and social effectiveness.
In a recent analysis of a sample of antipoverty programs—A Relevant War Against Poverty, co- authored with Jeannette Hopkins—it was clear that the Dark Ghetto findings had influenced the ra- tionale and programmatic structure of federally funded antipoverty and community-based action programs. But, this detailed study of these pro- grams within the first two years of the programs' existence predicted their failure by revealing the controlling and inhibiting fact that those human beings with power are deeply unwilling or unable to share even a modicum of real power with those who

Antipoverty programs based on these social realities were doomed to failure be- cause they reflected a total lack of commitment to eliminate poverty, to share power with the power- less. Above all, they reflected the inability of the
￼1050 AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGIST
decision makers and the society as a whole to change the set of perceiving and treating the poor and dark-skin minorities as justifiably rejected in- ferior human beings. These programs did not and would not operate in terms of the rationale and the goals of the potential equality of all human beings. They did not seek to accept and strengthen the humanity of the deprived through compassion, empathy, and a serious sharing of power.
AN EMERGING CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK
There is no doubt that these research projects, the developing ideas, and the related forms of so- cial action were influenced most, fundamentally by the psychodynamic theories of Alfred Adler. The late Francis Cecil Sunnier, Professor of Psychology at Howard University, introduced me to the ideas of Adlcr. It was Professor Sumner who first intro- duced me as an undergraduate to the promises of the science of psychology for the understanding of man and society. It was he who gave me my first serious appreciation of the complexities of the meanings of humanity. In his characteristic style, Professor Sumner presented Adler's thoughts with- in the framework of other psychoanalytic and psychodynamic theories and within the larger con- text of religion and philosophy. This experience had a profound influence on my thoughts, research, and professional and personal action.
The gestalt, wholistic, and organismic theories also exerted a strong influence on my developing ideas. Kurt Goldstein's ability to interpret his ob- servations of the meaning of the symptoms of the brain-injured patients in a unified psychodynamic perspective of the struggle of human beings to maintain an integrated ego—to minimize their deficiencies and maximize their available assets— reinforced the basic significance of Adlerian and organismic theory in my thinking. As one of Gold- stein's graduate students at Columbia University, f struggled to understand his lectures. T admired his ability to present and document a wholistic, organismic view of man as a biosocial organism.
pelled me more toward the social-psychological em- phasis of Adler and made me somewhat resistant to the Freudian emphasis on deeper intrapsychic dy- namics. In its emphasis on innate instinctive processes and its related inability to emphasize the effects of social problems and continued social pres- sures on the individual's effectiveness, traditional Freudian theory seemed inadequate—limited and constricted—for a dynamic social psychology. Freudian theory does not appear to offer a theo- retical basis for a psychology concerned with so- cial change or a psychotechnology other than one- to-one psychoanalytic therapy. Adler's concern with man's social interaction and his emphasis on the human struggle for self-esteem were much more compatible with my main research and action in seeking a humane technology to enhance the chances of humanity among men. The quest for a more enlightened social policy, morally and rationally determined social change, could not proceed from the premise that man is a totally or primarily non- rational organism whose most powerful drives are instinctive and animalistic. In this regard, my re- sistance to the Freudian perspective of man and society was not unlike the objections of the late Gordon Allport who refused to accept the Freudian view of man as an essentially nonrational being. Allport insisted that the rational components of the complexities of human motivation must be given at least an equal if not a dominant role with the non- rational.
The core Adlerian idea which persists in its influence on my thinking is the idea concerning the nature of psychological power in understanding human beings and human society. Bertrand Rus- sell's assertion that "the fundamental concept in social science is Power, in the same sense in which Energy is a fundamental concept in physics" rein- forced the influence of Adlerian theory in my think- ing. In his not too well-known book, Power, Bertrand Russell stated, "The laws of social dy- namics are—so I shall contend—only capable of being studied in terms of power in its various forms." He defines power rather pragmatically as "the production of intended effects."
In earlier exploration of the phenomenon of so- cial power, T defined it operationally as "the force or energy required to bring about, to sustain or to prevent social, political or economic change." As
In spite of the more dramatic, fashionable, pro-
vocative, and, in many respects, profound ideas of
Freud, my thoughts and scientific activities were
only peripherally influenced by the fundamental
Freudian premises. My persistent concerns with
the effects of the social system on the functioning
and effectiveness of individuals and groups pro- my research and my interest in social change in-
￼terests tended to converge and eventually fuse, I became preoccupied with the problem of a theory of social power as a unifying conceptual framework. More and more I tended to see social power, in its manifest forms, as that force or combination of forces which facilitated, blocked, or determined the rate and direction of social change. In a dynamic social situation, power expresses itself as a gestalt or a quantum expression of the power aspirations and competition among significant individuals and groups.
need to use the crutches of racial cruelty and ex- tremism are also forlorn, deprived, desperately pa- thetic human beings.
When one dares to confront the many examples of the mocking pathos of power, one finds oneself going beyond Adler even as he remains dependent upon fundamental Adlerian insights. The Adlerian emphasis on the affirmative struggle for self-esteem and status becomes intensified by the disturbing, almost intolerable reality that a positive self-esteem, what Freud calls narcissism, is not determined by forces inherent within the human organism, but is dependent upon external supports and reinforce- ments, and controlled by the judgments of others who themselves are also afflicted with the universal human anxiety of self-doubt.

the capacity to love and be loved and thereby the universe. They make possible perception,
strengthens the cycle of self-defeating obsession with power.
A contemporary example of human power pathos is found in the anguished cries of the advocates of black power. In this phenomenon it is clear that the verbalizations of power betray the reality of powerlessness. The frustrations, the rejection, the denial of the ability to fulfill legitimate aspirations are compensated for among extreme advocates of black power by the posture and the delusional rhet-
oric of a power which is persistently denied them. This insight into the nature of this particular form of diversionary pseudo-power paradoxically led me into a more empathic understanding of the human pathos and psychological predicament of white racial extremists. Through my understanding and racial identification with compensatory black ex- tremists, I came to understand that whites who
awareness, evaluation, self-reflection, anxiety, re- flection on the past, and anticipation of the future. They are unique in that they make the human ego real—sometimes painfully real. They create and validate humanity, and they sustain the struggle for justice and decency in human relationship even as they provide the basis for rationalizing cruelties and inhumanity.
To make these abstractions real, these mysterious human cortical cells require a rather specific bio- chemical environment. They require that oxygen and nourishment be provided and regulated through an elaborate capillary system. The unstable equi- librium within and around these cells must be main- tained within a tolerable range of variation if the human ego and the complexities of function and continuity inherent in the sense of self are to be sustained.
The essence of the human predicament is the
man consciousness is the mysterious substances and the quality of interactions among the human corti- cal cells. All we seem to know about these cells is that they are unique among all of the combinations of matter and energy which are known to exist in
￼1052 AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGIST
The normal functioning and the identity of the self can be disrupted through one or any combina- tion of disturbances within the internal environ- ment. Disruption in continuity of a personal iden- tity--loss of social and psychological continuity and existence—can occur in spite of the continuation of biological existence if there is any significant depri- vation in the specific biochemical requirements of these cortical cells. With such deprivation there can be changes in temperament and fundamental changes in the threshold of positive and negative responses or sensitivity to external environmental
forces.
Jn shorl, these cortical cells hold within them
the keys to the mystery of the definition and the functional quality of the self. They control by their ability to intensify, reduce, or obliterate the basic reality that is the self. And they are fragile. And it is upon the basis of their fragility that the human ego remains a fragile and delicate thing. To be human is not determined merely by the con- cretes of sensory functions, neural integration, and skeletal muscular behavior of the human organism. The essence of being human is defined by the nor- mal functioning of the uniquely complex human brain.
These insights are fraught with anxieties and probably should best be handled by denial or re- pression. Even before the ennui of youth became a fashionable topic of discussion, one of my students once suggested in a brilliant paper for my class in human motivation that the fundamental fear of man was the fear of confronting the void within. The sense of inner emptiness, a sense of limited experiential time, a sense of essential powerlessness, as the basic realities of the human experience—
these arc not tolerable insights. They must be compensated for with more positive, substantive concepts of self. Fortunately, the human brain that made this human predicament possible can also create, invent, or rationalize idcational substance up to and including indefinite continuity for the human ego.
The idea of the void within is abhorrent. The void must be filled. The creative activities of man —his religion, his philosophy, his art, hisliterature, his buildings, his cults, his cruelties, his science, his
objectifications of the inner turbulence of man. In proving to himself that his life is more than the continuous transformation of one form of biological and chemical energy into other forms of physical and behavioral energy, man seems compelled to mobilize and use psychological and social power constructively or destructively. The alternative would be to accept a level of desperation and stag- nation, indistinguishable from psychological death.
Among the paradoxes of the human predicament is that these disturbing insights, complicated as they are by the inevitability of evaluation inherent in the operation of human consciousness, demand that the human beings define human existence in terms greater than an interval between the acci- dents of conception and birth and the infinite noth- ingness of death. The mysterious power and forces which culminate in human consciousness insist that to be human is to be more than the awe- some and finite mystery of existential life. Human beings must affirm humanity and assert that there is purpose to and sacredness to human life despite
all threatening evidence to the contrary. This is the dynamic and the compensatory pathos of power. Affirmation in spite of—is the common denominator of human creativity and destructiveness; of human love and kindness and human hostility and cruelty; of human compassion and human egocentric postur- ing and bombast. It provides the basis for all that is sacred and barbaric in man.
In his discussion of the psychic fictions which arc essential in providing substance to human psy- chological existence, Adler stated in his Under- standing Human Nature:
We can realize how relative are the values of sensations, when not even these are absolute quantities; these elements of our psychic activity are influenced by the striving for a definite goal, our very perceptions are prejudiced by it, and are chosen, so to speak, with a secret hint at the final goal toward which the personality is striving.
We orient ourselves according to a fixed point which we have artificially created, which does not in reality exist, a fiction. This assumption is necessary because of the inade- quacy of our psychic life. . . . Tn the case of all psychic fictions we have to do with the following: we assume a fixed point even though closer observation forces us to ad- mit that it does not exist. The purpose of this assumption is simply to orient ourselves in the chaos of existence, so
that we can arrive at some apperception of relative values. The advantage is that we can categorize every sensation and every sentiment according to this fixed point, once we
technologies--are attemps to fill this void or to
obscure its existence. Human civilizations are have assumed it.
￼These psychic fictions, these ideational inventions and objective creations of man which constitute his culture and civilizations, ordinarily seem sufficient to quell temporarily the incipient anguish of the imminence of nonbeing. They frequently postpone the ultimate embarrassment of the acceptance of personal and collective nonimportance.
Of all the compensatory protective agents in- vented or created by the human brain as a cushion against the intolerable realities of human flimsiness, probably the most flexible and effective has been the idea of God. Man has invested God with both omnipotence and permanence. An analysis of the characteristics of God, the powers and functions of God, betrays the pathos and the vulnerability of man. One of the most important functions of God is that of protecting man against accepting and coming to terms with the realities of human limi- tations. In a most literal and basic psychological sense, God is the primary source of power for man. Man created God to create man with introjective strengths, with solidity, and with purpose and sub- stance. To perform this awesome and important task there must be an ideationally literal God. If for no other reason, therefore, God is not only not dead, man cannot permit God to die. If God were to die, human beings would have to die psychologi- cally, even though alive as organisms.
The importance of God as a protection against the fragility of the human ego is revealed in the demigods, the directly observable gods, created by the human mind and also invested with protective power. Magicians, medicine men, priests, bishops, kings, generals, father figures, movie stars, all serve similar if not identical divine functions. These charismatic figures, these personifications of power, are anointed and given virtues and powers beyond those found in ordinary men. Through identifica- tion with them and their projected power, the average man can obscure his weaknesses and affirm his ego. These human gods sometimes internalize the god-like powers attributed to them. They soon believe and act as if they are gods—or are required to engage in a continuous struggle against this tantalizing temptation. From this point of view, paradox emerges as the major characteristic or quality of a bemused God—a God of the inescap- able practical joke of the human predicament.
A similar protective and power brokerage func- tion is played by the variety of groups that human
beings have invented and emotionally identified with. Tribes, cults, religions, nations, and their coercive and protective dogmas and ideologies may be seen as group gods, which bestow substance and strengths upon otherwise vulnerable individuals. The strength and power of a group seem directly proportional to the degree to which it can compen- sate for the fragility or obscure the insignificance and pathos of its individual members. These group benefits appear to be enhanced by the group's dem-
onstrated ability to exercise power over and inflict cruelty upon other groups of human beings.
SOCIAL POWER: A STRUGGLE FOR INTEGRATION FOR ORGANISMIC AND SOCIAL SYSTEMS
There is the tendency among many of us who are concerned with studying more systematically the crucial role of social power in human affairs to present our case as if power is the only significant motivational force and as if it can operate in isola- tion from the total complexity of structure and integrated functions of organismic and social sys- tems.
A realistic view of social power requires that it be seen as a pervasive and integrative force, oper- ating in relationship to other forces in the dynamic constellation of the human personality.
Personality is defined here as the characteristic way in which the individual human organism mo- bilizes and uses all of its available resources in its struggle for survival, satisfaction, status, meaning, and moral integrity.
This definition suggests a hierarchy of the moti- vational components of personality: in this hier- archy, power or status needs fall midway between the more primitive drives toward survival and sensual satisfactions and the uniquely human mo- tives of the quest for meaning and moral integrity. Power may, therefore, operate toward either end of the motivational continuum to reinforce or make dominant either the primitive or the human pro- pensities of man. Power may make stark and rigid, or determine fixation on or regression to, one or another of the other motivational levels; and it may determine the pattern of relationship among the motivational levels. It can also intensify, ob- scure, or contaminate one or more of them as they function in the dynamic system of interaction which is the totality of the personality. Power

and status needs can determine whether other needs will be gratified in animalistic, egocentric, or non- adaptive ways or in human, empathic, and socially constructive channels.
This is the dilemma of power from whence the pathos of power arises.
CONTEMPORARY CRISES OF THE PATHOS OF POWER
Power cannot be exercised without inducing some form of reaction or counterreaction. Social power in its manifest forms, therefore, almost always in- volves confrontations and conflicts; and generally results in either accommodation, with or without residual resentment; or in acute defiance, sporadic counterreaction, or prolonged and smoldering re- sistance. This is the psychodynamic base for the cycle of power: reaction to power and counter- reaction.
The rewards of the exercise of power are transi- tory, and the gratifications of power and status needs are frequently nonadaptive and self-defeating. The following arc some specific symptoms of the nonadaptive pathos, futility, of power.
1. When the exercise of power does not, in fact, increase or when it interferes with the chances of gratifying the more basic needs of survival and satisfaction.
2. When the exercise of power is ambiguous, ran- dom, arbitrary, regressive, disproportionately in- tense and rigid in spite of consequences.
3. When the exercise of power becomes so func- tionally autonomous and extreme in its intensity as to subvert and pervert the critical, rational, and moral capacities of individuals and groups.
4. When the attainment of the symbols of power or the unchallenged actuality of power results in a sense of futility and ennui and the dissipation of the desire or the capacity to use power construc- tively or creatively.
The continuation, intensification, and cumulative effect of any combination of these symptoms are major threats to the organism or the social system. This crisis betrays the fact that the power system has become self-directing and is no longer being controlled by the organism and social system in terms of their adaptive needs. The survival of the system would then seem to depend on its capacity to redirect the power drives and channel their energy toward constructive ends within the im- perative period of time.
Certainly, the normal brain has the necessary survival alert systems which ordinarily can be put into operation to prevent the organism from pur- suing rigidly the paths of self-destruction. Whether the brain of man can provide the basis for resolv- ing the contemporary survival crises of social power positively and constructively remains a mat- ter of conjecture. It is a mocking fact that the human brain can provide intellectual and moral rationalizations for a nonadaptive, ultimately de- structive use of social power. It can invent ideational, delusional realities that provide the crutches for the fragile human ego. It can justify human pomp and pretense as a myriad of non- rational forces propels man toward disaster. But the human brain is also the only source of positive alternatives—alternatives to personal anxieties, hu- miliations, intergroup tensions, violence—alterna- tives to suicide, homicide, and the barbarities of war.
Contemporary man's technological mastery of matter and energy, and the related ultimate thermo- nuclear weaponry, confronts us with the fact that it is now possible to destroy the human species through the nonadaptive use of human intelligence and the destructive, pathetic use of social power. This threat is so ultimate and so urgent that it is understandable that human beings would seek to deny or repress it in order to continue to function as if it did not exist. But it does exist. And it must be handled if human beings are to be able to function without the gnawing and debilitating anxieties inherent in the imminence of extinction.
This survival crisis requires immediate mobiliza- tion of all that is positive within man to provide us with the time necessary to prevent man from destroying the human species—and to provide man with the time required to evolve and to develop a more stable organismic base for the rational and moral exercise of social power.
ERA OF PSYCHOTECHNOLOGY
The present generation of human beings is re- quired to develop psychological and social sciences with that degree of precision, predictability, and moral control essential to the survival of man. The awesome advances in the physical and biologi- cal sciences have made psychotechnology impera- tive. Man can no longer afford the luxuries of a leisurely, trial-and-error, trivia-dominated approach
￼THE PATHOS OF POWEE 1055
to the behavioral sciences. The behavioral sciences results but that they require continuous reinforce-
are now the critical sciences; they will determine the answer to the ultimate moral question of human survival.
Given the urgency of this immediate survival problem, the psychological and social sciences must enable us to control the animalistic, barbaric, and primitive propensities in man and subordinate these negatives to the uniquely human moral and ethical characteristics of love, kindness, and empathy.
The redirecting of power away from the absurd, the pathetic, and the self-defeating can be and now must be seen as a responsibility and goal of science and psychotechnology. We can no longer afford to rely solely on the traditional, prescientific attempts to contain human cruelty and destructiveness. The techniques and appeals of religion, moral philos- ophy, law, and education seemed appropriate and civilized approaches to the control of man's prim- itive and egocentric behavior in a prenuclear age. They are, in themselves, no longer appropriate because they permit too wide a margin of error and a degree of unpredictability that is rationally in- consistent with the present survival urgency. Fur-
thermore, moral verbalizations of the past have been prostituted by the pathos of power; they have been perverted by the pretenses of rationality in the service of inhumanity if not barbarity.
The traditional perspective and training of psy- chologists, educators, and moral philosophers would lead them to continue to argue that moral controls of human primitive and egocentric impulses be sought by redoubling our efforts in developing more effective forms of moral education designed to pro- duce individual human beings with ethical autonomy and integrity. They would argue that it is still possible to preserve human civilization by training human beings toward a higher quality of inter- personal relationships; by developing within indi- vidual human beings greater personal and social effectiveness through greater ego strengths. They would continue to assert that a variety of be- havioral modification techniques, imposed particu- larly in childhood, could be expected to reinforce altruism, empathy, and group commitment and sub- ordinate egocentricity in normal human beings.
An objective appraisal of the results of these approaches to a control of the negatives in man and the enhancement of his positives would seem to suggest that not only are they unpredictable in
ment and a prolonged period of time in order to demonstrate positive results. We do not now appear to have the amount of time which these techniques require for hoped-for success.
This present era of psychotechnology comes with the abrupt recognition of this fact of a very limited time within which the human brain can obtain and use that knowledge required to control, protest, and affirm humanity with precision and predictability. Already there are many provocative and suggestive findings from neurophysiological, biochemical, and psychopharmacological and psychological research. The work on the effects of direct stimulation of certain areas of the brain; the role of specific areas of the midbrain in controlling certain affects; the effects of certain drugs on exciting, tranquilizing, or depressing the emotional and motivational levels of the individual; and the effects of externally in- duced behavioral changes on internal biochemistry of the organism suggest that we might be on the threshold of that type of scientific biochemical in- tervention which could stabilize and make dominant the moral and ethical propensities of man and subordinate, if not eliminate, his negative and primitive behavioral tendencies.
On the basis of the presently available evidence, it is reasonable to believe that this type of precise, direct psychotechnological intervention geared to- ward strengthening man's moral and positive human characteristics could be obtained and implemented within a few years, and with a fraction of the cost required to produce the atom bomb; and much less than the present cost of our explorations in outer space.
It is here being suggested that with the mobiliza- tion of the necessary scientific personnel, financial resources, and research facilities, it is now possible —indeed, imperative—to reduce human anxieties, tensions, hostilities, violence, cruelty, and the de- structive power irrationalities of man which are the basis of wars. This contemporary approach to assuring the survival of the human species offers a scientific basis for William James' philosophical wish for a moral equivalence or alternative to wars.
In reducing the negatives and enhancing the posi- tive potentials in human beings, in addition to the political organizational and administrative problems to be resolved, there would be a number of im- portant psychological barriers to be faced and
￼1056 AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGIST
solved with realism and clue regard lor that essen- tial humanity which differentiates human beings from mere organisms or living machines. The process and techniques of direct biochemical inter- vention or any form of effective psychotechnology must take into account the totality, the inter- relatedncss, the complex gestalt of the human moti- vational, affective, and cognitive system. Jn seek- ing to enhance the positives of empathy and kind- ness and reduce the cruel and the barbaric in man, psychotechnology must not destroy the creative, evaluative, and selective capacities of human beings. Without the desire to explore, to reorganize things and ideas, to vary moods, and to produce, at least with the illusions of flexibility and volition, the human being would indeed be an empty organic vessel and it would be difficult to justify the mere fact of survival under these conditions. In addition to precision and predictability, this suggested psy- chotechnological intervention into human affairs must be affirmatively humane. An inviolable sense of moral responsibility is the essential new in- gredient which this new era of the psychological sciences must bring to the contemporary require- ments of science.
The implications of a precise and predictable psychotechnological intervention into the whole arena of human interaction are of such vast im- portance as to demand that the most careful and rigorous planning, research, and testing precede any attempts to apply these findings on a larger scale. Because these are uniquely human problems with which this program is concerned, the pretest sub- jects would have to be human beings. The impli- cations of an effective psychotechnology for the con- trol of criminal behavior and the amelioration of the moral insensitivities which produce reactive criminality in others arc clear. It would seem, therefore, that there would be moral and rational justification for the use of compulsive criminals as pretest subjects in seeking precise forms of inter- vention and moral control of human behavior. This suggestion is based on the assumption that no human being who is not impelled by some forms of internal, biochemical or external, social forces—or some combination of both—would choose to be a
criminal if he were provided with options.
It is a fact that a few men in the leadership positions in the industrialized nations of the world now have the power to determine among them-
selves, through collaboration or competition, the survival or extinction of human civilization. They can, in fact, exercise this power only within the present limitations of the pathos and contradictions of power for temporary good or unpredictable ulti- mate evil. There is no way of predicting the personal and emotional stability of these leaders with the life and death power over mankind. Nor do we now know the relationship between those personal characteristics which are related to suc- cess in obtaining positions of political and govern- mental power on the one hand and the degree of personal, emotional, and moral stability on the other hand. The masses of human beings are now required to live and continue to work on faith, hope, denial, and the acceptance of the chances that their powerful leaders will have the strength to use their power wisely and morally.
Given these contemporary facts, it would seem logical that a requirement imposed on all power- controlling leaders—and those who aspire to such leadership—would be that they accept and use the earliest perfected form of psychotechnological, bio- chemical intervention which would assure their positive use of power and reduce or block the possibility of their using power destructively. This form of psychotechnological medication would be a type of internally imposed disarmament. It would assure that there would be no absurd or barbaric use of power. It would provide the masses of human beings with the security that their leaders would not or could not sacrifice them on the altars of their personal ego pathos, vulnerability—and in- stability.
It is possible to object to the era of psycho- technology on "moral" grounds and to assert that these suggestions are repugnant because they are manipulative and will take away from man his natural right to make errors—even those errors which perpetrate cruelties and destruction upon other human beings. In the light of the realities of and possible consequences of nuclear weaponry, these allegedly moral arguments seem mockingly, pathetically immoral. It would seem that man could afford to indulge in this type of abstract, pre- scientific moralizing in the past when his most destructive weapons were clubs, bow and arrows, or even gunpowder. To continue this type of thinking in an age when nuclear weapons are capable of destroying millions of human beings in a single
￼irrational man-made event would seem to be a form of self-defeating and immoral rigidity.
There could be the further objection that bio- chemical intervention into the inner psychological recesses of motivation, temperament, and behavior of human beings is an unacceptable, intolerable tampering with the natural or God-given character- istics of man. The negative connotations presently associated with discussions of drugs and the drug culture, particularly among young people, could be invoked to support this objection. One could also object on the ground that, in effect, what is here being suggested under the guise of an imperative psychotechnology is just another form of Utopian mechanization of human beings through drugging the masses and their leaders.
These objections seem to be based on semantic grounds rather than on essential substance. In medicine, physical diseases are controlled through medication. Medicines are prescribed by doctors to help the body overcome the detrimental effects of bacteria or viruses—or to help the organism restore that balance of internal biochemical environment necessary for health and effectiveness. Medicines are not only used to treat the diseases of individ-
uals, but arc also used preventively in the form of vaccines. All medicines are drugs—and all drugs used therapeutically are forms of intervention to influence and control the natural processes of dis- ease. Selective and appropriate medication to as- sure psychological health and moral integrity is now imperative for the survival of human society.
The era of psychotechnology, having been im- posed upon man by the physical scientific advances of man, cannot now be avoided. It must be used affirmatively, wisely, and with com- passion. To fulfill these requirements, it must have a sound scientific, factual base. It must also be firmly rooted in rational morality. It must respect and enhance that which is uniquely human in man—those positive qualities which promise a fu- ture of human grandeur. In meeting these and related requirements, a rigorous, tough-minded sci- ence and technology of psychology will save man from the more destructive consequences of his absurdities and propensities—the pathos of power— and will provide him with the time necessary to evolve and stabilize those centers of his brain which will make social morality and human survival no longer a matter of chance.

New York University
WANT to talk with you about a psychologist's Iview of a major social change which is taking place in this country. I am referring to the series of events in the South which have followed the Supreme Court's decisions against segregation in
public schools.
As citizens we may consider the Court's rulings
wise or unwise, we may applaud or condemn specific actions taken in the South, we may find the ferment and the turmoil and the apparently inconsistent re- actions in the South fascinating or confusing, or both. But as psychologists our approach must be to consider, on the one hand, whether our available knowledge can contribute to an understanding of what is going on, and, on the other hand, to seek in the changing situation opportunities for research which will increase our understanding of the proc- ess of change in relations between social groups.
I believe that even in the present rather primitive
state of social psychology, we do have knowledge
which would suggest a different interpretation of
events than everyday common sense provides. Take,
for instance, the recent vote in Virginia, in which
residents of that state, by a two-to-one majority,
approved a plan which will make possible the trans-
formation of public schools into what are tech- and St. Louis, which have already undergone de- nically private schools in order to evade the Su- segregation. I do not mean to say that I doubt that preme Court ruling. A correspondent of the New the people of Virginia are opposed to desegregation; York Times, in commenting on the vote, drew the on the contrary, I think the vote is a very clear conclusion that much of the South will not accept expression of that opposition. But I do not think racially integrated schools and that desegregation it provides a basis for predicting what their be-
there will have to be a slow evolutionary process. I am doubtful that this is the correct interpretation; I will shortly suggest another possibility.

havior will be when school desegregation is initiated. I would guess that, if similar votes had been taken in other communities before desegregation was started, the balloting would have been about the same.
Or—what about the school strikes? During the
first weeks of desegregation in Washington and in
Baltimore white children went on strike. Does this
bode ill for future relations between white and
Negro students in desegregated schools in those
communities? The obvious interpretation is that prediction of behavior. The classic example, of the students struck because of their antagonism to
1
association with Negroes. But is this interpreta- tion correct?
And, on a much larger scale—what are the long- range implications of the fact that schools are being desegregated in many communities, and probably sooner or later throughout the South? Many in- terpreters have seen in this event the beginning of the end of racial segregation in the South. How realistic an expectation is this?
I don't know, with any certainty, the answers to these questions. In fact, my main argument is going to be that the significance of the Supreme Court's decision, from the standpoint of a science of psychology, is that it provides a rare opportunity to acquire more of the kind of knowledge we need in order to make better interpretations of such matters than is now possible.
First, however, I want to indicate that I think we already know enough to suggest alternative—though not necessarily correct—interpretations for each of the points I have just mentioned.
Take the Virginia vote. My expectation would be that when school desegregation does take place in Virginia it will be with as little unpleasantness as there has been in places like Washington, Baltimore,
I base my interpretation on a number of studies which suggest that, in the area of race relations, stated opinion is frequently not a reliable basis for
course, is the study in which LaPiere (6), after traveling throughout the United States with a Chinese couple, wrote to the hotels and restaurants which they had visited, asking if the establishment
￼would accept Chinese as guests. What he found was that over 90 per cent of the respondents (all of whom actually had served the Chinese couple) said they would not do so. Saenger's (9) interviews with white women in New York City made the same point. Individuals who had been seen buying goods from Negro salesgirls denied that they would do so.
As it happens, we have direct evidence that stated opposition to school desegregation in Southern communities does not necessarily lead to hostile action once desegregation has been initiated.
For example, Bower and Walker (1) in interviews with a cross section of the population of Washing- ton, D.C., in June, 1954, found that 52 per cent of the white respondents thought the Supreme Court decision was bad, only 24 per cent thought it was good, and another 24 per cent was neutral. In other words, among those who had definite opinions, feeling was two to one against the decision—the same proportion as the Virginia vote. Yet desegre- gation took place the following fall. According to Bower and Walker, the first gradual change-over worked so well that the school superintendent de- cided to speed the process a bit and authorized a large-scale transfer: at this point there was a brief strike by junior and senior high school students, which collapsed after a few days when it received little support from the adult community. Except
for this brief strike, desegregation proceeded with- out incident. When the same sample of respondents were reinterviewed toward the end of the school year, even among those who had disapproved of the Supreme Court decision, 39 per cent conceded that desegregation was going "very well" or "fairly well," and only 29 per cent said it was going "not so well" or "badly."
Or take the story of Tucson, Arizona, as reported by Edward and Marianne Dozier in Schools in Transition, a series of community studies edited by Williams and Ryan (12). In the spring of 1950 a bill to make school desegregation compulsory was presented directly to the voters of the state, and was rejected. During this election the Tucson superintendent of schools publicly supported the bill; he received a number of anonymous letters and telephone calls condemning his stand. A year later the state legislature passed a bill permitting de- segregation, but' not requiring it. The Tucson schools were desegregated at the beginning of the next school term—and at this time there was no
public protest from anyone in the community. Other examples of this same sort could be cited.
As for the school strikes—my guess is that, far from being an omen of continuing trouble, they will leave almost no trace. I would predict that if after a few months you looked at interracial associations and attitudes within the schools in towns in which there had been strikes and others which desegre- gated at the same time without any student strikes, you would find few, if any, differences. I base this interpretation not only on the principle I mentioned in connection with the Virginia vote—that expressed opposition is not necessarily a reliable indicator of future behavior—but on a question as to whether strikes really do reflect widespread student opposi- tion to desegregation. Two of the most widely publicized strikes have been in Washington and Baltimore. But in Washington only 2 per cent, and in Baltimore only 3 per cent, of the total student body stayed out of school. Bower, Walker, and Mendelsohn (1, 7) interviewed 100 student strikers in Washington and concluded, briefly, that "nothing specific seemed to have started the strike and stu- dents participated mostly because other students were in it." Although the strikers repeated rumors about attacks by Negroes on white students, when they were asked what made them stay out of school, the most frequent answer did not refer to the ostensible issues but to the influence of their friends and schoolmates. Many were carrying schoolbooks and lunch boxes, and had clearly set out for school
as usual; they were drawn into the strike along the way, and one may speculate that they participated as much for the adventure as for reasons having to do with segregation or desegregation.
What about the expectation that the end of school segregation will lead to sweeping changes in the pattern of race relations in the South—and, specifically, that it will mean the end of all segrega- tion? In expressing some reservations about this I do not mean for one moment to underestimate the importance of the Supreme Court decisions; I share the general judgment that they constitute a major historic event. But I think there is a tendency to overestimate the probable effects of the change in school patterns, both among liberals who hope that desegregation of schools will lead to desegregation in all aspects of life, and among many Southerners who fear that it will. One of the clearest findings of studies of the relation between intergroup contact and attitude change is that, while individuals rather
THE AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGIST
￼quickly come to accept and even approve of associa- tion with members of another social group in situa- tions of the type where they have experienced such association, this approval is not likely to be gen- eralized to other situations unless the individuals have quite close personal relationships with mem- bers of the other group. Thus, for example, Hard- ing and Hogrefe (4) found that white salesgirls in Philadelphia department stores who worked in departments where there were Negro salesgirls were more likely than those in all-white departments to express willingness to work with Negroes, but were no more willing to have Negroes as neighbors or as friends. A particularly dramatic example of the extent to which behavior may be limited to a specific situation is Minard's description (8) of a mining community in West Virginia where white and Negro miners work amicably together in mixed teams, sometimes with a Negro supervising white
workers, but separate at the mine shaft and lead their above-ground lives in complete segregation— living in separate neighborhoods, eating in separate restaurants, participating jointly in no activities save those in the union hall. And one need only look around any Northern community to see that unsegregated schools do not necessarily lead to un- segregated living.
lations leads us to question the more obvious com- mon sense interpretations which are usually offered. We look for meanings other than those which ap- pear on the face of things and, by taking a more comprehensive view of the determinants of human action, less often assume direct correspondence be- tween stated opinion and other kinds of behavior. Such an approach suggests alternative and probably more accurate interpretations of specific events. But, to be most useful, psychological science must go beyond explanations of specific phenomena, and provide a schema within which a range of events can be organized and understood. Can social psy- chology provide such a framework for viewing the present scene?
My answer—as you may guess—is "yes" and "no." To elaborate this, I must distinguish be- tween two aspects of the events following on the Supreme Court decision: first, those having to do with the decision of policy makers whether to ac- cept the Court's ruling and desegregate the schools; second, those having to do with what happens once desegregation has been initiated. On questions of the second sort—the process and the effects of de- segregation—we have a considerable body of rele- vant information, and, I think, the beginningsof an organized analytical approach. Within this schema we have a basis for at least tentative predic- tions and for identifying with some certainty the
kinds of situations in which research could provide answers to crucial questions. On the first aspect— that of the process of deciding whether to de- segregate—we have much less to draw upon; I should say we are in a position of having to de- velop simultaneously both a systematic approach
DESEGREGATION: A PSYCHOLOGICAL ANALYSIS
That this kind of compartmentalization occurs
also when schools are newly desegregated is evi-
denced by the descriptions of a number of border
communities, in the Williams and Ryan book (12).
In community after community they report that,
although relations between white and Negro stu-
dents within the schools are matter-of-fact and even
friendly, the two groups go their separate ways out-
side of school. The example is given of a white and ways of testing the hypotheses which grow out
mother, at first reluctant to send her children to a mixed school, who found that her children liked the school and their Negro teachers. She became per- fectly tolerant about the classroom situation, but did not want her children to eat in the school cafeteria or play with Negro students off the school grounds. Time will tell, of course, whether over a period of years school desegregation will gradually extend to desegregation in other areas of living, but there seems no reason to expect an immediate sweeping change.
THE NEED FOR AN ANALYTICAL SCHEMA
These few examples are more than enough to show how our present understanding of social re-
of this approach.
A TTITUDE CHANGES FOLLOWING CONTACT
INTERGROUP
Let me start with the area in which I think our knowledge and our thinking are relatively far along. After the last war, a number of psychologists and sociologists interested in attitude change turned their attention to problems of intergroup relations. They developed a consensus that some of the most important determinants of attitude change toward other social groups were to be found in the ex- perience of face-to-face contact with members of those groups. At first, they tended to the optimistic view that such personal contact with members of
￼another group was sure to be a powerful influence toward favorable attitude change.
However, in spite of the considerable number of studies which found such a relationship, some did not. A much earlier study by Horowitz (5)—and one of the most interesting in the present context-— had already reported that attitudes toward Negroes of white boys in racially mixed schools in New York City differed little from attitudes of white boys in segregated schools in Tennessee and in Georgia.
Additional research on the relationship between intergroup contact and changes in attitude gave rise to a variation of the old chicken-and-egg ques- tion: A number of studies had found contact with members of an ethnic group other than one's own associated with favorable attitudes toward that ethnic group. But which came first—the contact or the favorable attitude? This methodological dif- ficulty led to an interest in situations of so-called involuntary contact-—on the job, in public housing, in the armed forces, etc.—that is, in situations where the individual is in a setting where there are members of another social group, but he is there not because of a desire to associate with that group but because of a strong push or pull from some other source.
Also, it proved helpful to distinguish between mere physical presence of members of different ethnic groups in a common situation, on the one hand, and the occurrence of interaction between them, on the other. We are now thinking in terms of the following schema: Individuals from two ethnic groups encounter one another involuntarily in some situation. This encounter may or may not lead to interaction, depending on the characteristics of the individuals involved and on the nature of the situation. When it does, the interaction may vary in amount and quality and this variation, in turn, influences the type of attitude change which takes place.
The influence of conditions under which contact occurs. When we raise the question, "What does the nature of the contact situation have to do with the outcome of the experience?", the need to iden- tify the dimensions in terms of which contact situa- tions can be described becomes apparent.
Here are three examples of what I mean. One of the characteristics of a contact situation is the ex- tent to which it offers the opportunity for the par- ticipants to get to know one another—labeled, for
short, its acquaintance potential. There is great variation in the extent to which the characteristics of individuals are revealed during contact. You may encounter an elevator operator, for example, twice a day for years, without communication about anything other than the weather. A contrasting situation—that of living as neighbors—does not im- pose comparable limitations on the areas over which communication may take place and individuality emerge.
A second characteristic of contact situations has to do with the way in which they define the relative status of participants belonging to the two ethnic groups. For example, in a given work situation, Negroes may have only menial jobs while white persons are in skilled or supervisory positions; in another work situation, Negroes and whites may be doing the same kinds of jobs.
My third example of a dimension along which contact situations differ involves the nature of the social norm toward contact of one ethnic group with another. In some situations, the general expecta- tion of persons in authority and of most of the par- ticipants may be that friendly association between members of the two groups is appropriate; in other situations, even though for some reason members of the two groups are present, the general feeling on the part of at least one of the groups may be that any unnecessary mingling should be avoided.
I have time this afternoon to examine the impli- cations of only one of these three concepts for our thinking about the outcomes of desegregation in the public schools of the South—the social norm regarding interaction with the other group. Several studies have pointed to the significance of this variable.
Thus, Minard (8), in the study I have already mentioned of the behavior of white workers in coal mines where they worked with Negroes on an un- segregated basis, and of the same workers in the segregated communities where the mines were lo- cated, estimated that about three-fifths of the men adapted their behavior, without apparent conflict, to the generally accepted practices in the specific situation—even to the extent of sitting next to Negroes in the mine bus but sitting in the white section when they transfer to the public bus.
The perceived norm with regard to contact also has wider effects. In a study of relationships within biracial public housing projects (13), we found that white housewives differed not only in the extent
THE AMERICAN
PSYCHOLOGIST
￼of their association with Negroes in the project but in their views as to whether other white women in the project approved of associating with Negroes. We found that those who believed that the other white women in the project approved of such as- sociation showed much more favorable attitudes toward Negroes than did those who believed that the other white women disapproved of such as- sociation. With minor exceptions, this influence of the perceived social norm showed up regardless of whether the women lived in integrated or in build- ing-segregated projects, or of whether they had much or little contact with Negroes: those who be- lieved the other white women in the project ap- proved of interracial association were more favorable in their attitudes toward Negroes than were the comparable white housewives who thought such association was not approved.
The question may, of course, be raised whether perception of the social climate is not itself a func- tion of one's own attitude. The investigators in this study concluded that, while the white house- wife's own attitude might color to some extent her interpretation of the views of other women in the project, on the whole the perceptions of social cli- mate were based on more or less objective evidence.
The cumulative weight of these and other studies highlights the effect of what is generally referred to as the social climate or social atmosphere. What they tell us is that interracial contacts take place in a social context in which the individual is re- sponding not only to persons from another ethnic group but also to what he believes would be judged proper in such relationships by those whose social approval he needs and seeks. This, of course, is a familiar and pervasive characteristic of human be- havior. The fact that it operates generally below the level of conscious awareness and is often ac- companied by the production of beliefs and feelings which rationalize otherwise incomprehensible be- havior gives it a prominent place in the study of social relations.
Nevertheless not enough progress has been made with the task of studying analytically the effect of social climate on the outcomes of intergroup con- tact. Some effort has been made to identify factors contributing to it. It seems possible to distinguish several components: first, positions taken publicly by individuals or groups who carry an aura of moral authority or of extremely high prestige (for example, the Supreme Court, the President of the
United States, church figures); second, the attitudes and behavior of the general population of the com- munity or the region; third, the statements and practices of persons in authority in the particular situation such as the employer or the school super- intendent; and fourth, the behavior, expectations, beliefs, etc., of other members of one's own group with whom one is in direct personal association.
It would be of great interest to know, for in- stance, the relative weight of a position taken by a powerful but distant authority such as the Supreme Court as compared with the norms of the face-to- face group in influencing an individual's reaction to new experiences of interracial contact. And it would be of interest to know what effect a face-to- face group norm that is in conflict with the position taken by the powerful but distant authority has on the interpretation of the latter's action and how this bears on the individual's reaction to novel con- tact experiences. Do Southerners, for instance, more than others, perceive the anti-segregation de- cisions as a political—in the low sense of the term —act rather than as a truly juridical one? And do individuals who so perceive the decisions react dif- ferently to contact experiences than do those who believe the Supreme Court justices were honestly and faithfully attempting to abide by strictly con- stitutional considerations?
In cases where the norm of the immediate group differs from that held by the larger population, we need to know which one is more likely to be fol- lowed. And, since the other members of one's im- mediate group in a situation of intergroup contact are themselves subject to the influences of the con- tact experience, we need to study changes in the face-to-face group norm itself.
The Supreme Court decisions, and the events which have followed them, provide a rare oppor- tunity for studying questions of this sort. We are, in effect, presented with a ready-made laboratory in which, on the one hand, the position of national figures—notably, of course, of the Court itself—has become prominent and is a constant, but where in- dividual communities present a wide range of varia- tion in terms of the position taken by state and city political leaders, local school authorities, and the residents. Studies of border communities in which school desegregation has already taken place, as reported by Williams and Ryan (12), show an enormous range in this respect. In Cairo, Illinois, for instance, desegregation was initiated reluctantly,
DESEGREGATION: A PSYCHOLOGICAL ANALYSIS
￼as the result of threats that the state would with- hold financial aid and of legal action by the NAACP; the local school authorities, apparently the entire white population, and much of the Negro popula- tion, appeared to be opposed to desegregation. At the other extreme, Carlsbad, New Mexico, operating under a permissive state law, began to desegregate its schools two years before the Supreme Court de- cision was actually handed down. All important segments of the community seemed to support the move. The superintendent of schools advocated it;
the board of education favored the change on the basis of monetary savings; teachers and principals, on the whole, were not opposed; the Ministerial Al- liance cooperated; community leaders in general took the position that times were changing, and "we might as well go along with it since we can't stop it"; the white high school students voted for integration at the high school level. There are still other communities—such as Hoxie, Arkansas— where the school authorities favor desegregation on economic grounds but general community opinion is strongly opposed.
This wide variation among communities provides a striking opportunity—one which it is probably not possible to create under laboratory conditions, and which is not likely to be again duplicated on such a scale in our lifetime—for studying the effects on social change of differences in social norms, and the relative influence of different sources of norms.
Were we able to utilize this real-life laboratory, I would find of especial interest the community which desegregates its schools while all the sources of social climate save those at the national level oppose the step and, where possible, act to limit its effect. It is in such communities that I suspect we may see the really dramatic developments. Under the influence of the social norms which pre- vail at the outset, the schoolroom contact may seem for some time to be without effect. Then at some later period—and I could not guess how much later —there will be a time during which change in the relationships between white and Negro students proceeds at what will seem an unexpectedly rapid pace. Behind this, if I am right, will lurk un- recognized the influence of a changed social norm among the students themselves. It seems to be often the case that the basis for a shift in norms develops well in advance of the shift itself. When, for some reason, the new norm crystallizes in the
perceptions of members of a group they may show very suddenly behavior for which in fact they had been individually ready for some time. A factor which may help encourage such a development in school desegregation is the general readiness of adolescents to rebel against adult authority.
The influence of characteristics oj individuals who are in contact. So much for this illustration of the need to think in terms of characteristics of the con- tact situation when analyzing the outcomes of in- voluntary presence in intergroup contact situations. Let me mention more briefly another class of varia- bles which seem important: namely, characteristics of the individuals who are in contact. They are of interest from two quite different points of view. First, each group constitutes part of the contact situation for the other group. Characteristics which are relevant from this point of view may be thought of as "characteristics of the individual as object" or "characteristics of the object-group." Second, each group may be looked at as potential changers as a result of the contact. Characteristics which are relevant from this point of view I shall refer to as "characteristics of the individual as subject" or "characteristics of the subject-group."
To the extent that learning about the other group takes place in intergroup contact, it follows that the characteristics of the individuals with whom contact takes place may have an effect on the out- come. With specific reference to the interethnic character of the contact, two aspects of the char- acteristics of object individuals seem likely to be of particular importance: the extent to which the in- dividuals differ from the commonly held stereotypes about the object group; and the extent to which they resemble the subject individuals in terms of background characteristics, interests, etc.
It seems likely that the great variety of patterns which are appearing in the course of the shift to desegregated schools may give rise to situations which differ in this respect. For example, Valien's report on the process of desegregation in Cairo, Illinois (12), notes that, because of a variety of community pressures, middle- and upper-class Negro children remained in segregated schools, and only children of the lowest socioeconomic group en- rolled in the formerly white schools. Many of these children were below average in intellectual ability, had had poor records in the Negro schools, and did not do well in their new schools; according
THE AMERICANPSYCHOLOGIST
￼to the report, they tended, because of this selective process, to confirm the white stereotypes that Negroes are stupid and lazy. On the other hand, there will certainly be other communities where the children of the better-educated Negro families will enter mixed schools. While it will admittedly be difficult to identify in advance situations where the Negro children in a mixed school will tend to con- form to the derogatory stereotypes and others where they will not, examination of the characteristics of residential neighborhoods should make it possible to identify schools where each of these situations is likely to occur. Comparisons of attitudes and behavior of white children in the two types of schools should throw considerable light on the im- portance of characteristics of the object individuals in determining attitudes.
When we consider the individuals in the contact situation as subjects, we regard them from a some- what different point of view. Focusing now upon the attitude changes they may undergo, we would like to know why some change more and others less; some in one direction, others in another. Two classes of personal variables may be thought of as likely to influence the individual's reaction to inter- group contact: the nature and intensity of initial attitudes toward the object group, and aspects of personality or character structure which may pre- dispose one to hostile reactions toward members of outgroups.
The few studies which have attempted to take account of initial attitudes have emerged with a striking diversity of conclusions. Two studies in public housing projects (3, 13) found that white housewives who said they were initially unfavorable to Negroes were more likely to report favorable attitude changes than were those who reported themselves as being originally favorable. Another study (11), of white residents of a block into which Negroes had moved, reported exactly the opposite finding: those who were relatively favorable toward Negroes at the time the first Negro family was about to move in became more favorable after the Negroes had been living there a few weeks; those who were initially unfavorable had become still more unfavorable.
All of these studies took into account simply dif- ferences in the degree of favorableness or unfavor- ableness of the attitudes rather than the particular constellation of beliefs and feelings. It may be,
however, that there are other differences in at- titudes which make them more or less resistant to change. It has sometimes been stated, for example, that there are at least two distinct constellations of attitudes in the South. According to one, Negroes are gentle, fun-loving, jolly, but childlike and ir- responsible; this attitude is said to have a warm, affectionate component; one is fond of Negroes, but just doesn't consider them intellectually and socially the same class of human being as oneself. The second, apparently quite different, attitude constellation is dominated by apprehension of the Negro as potentially dangerous, animal-like, and sexually uncontrolled. It is likely, of course, that the two constellations may often exist simultane- ously in the same individual.
If these observations of differences in kinds of at- titude are correct, it is reasonable to ask whether they differ in the extent to which they can be changed by experience with Negroes. For example, if there is really an attitude which is made up of friendly feelings in combination with unrealistic be- liefs about Negroes and a caste feeling that they are a different order of being (and from my personal experience, I believe there is), is it possible that experience with Negroes in a situation where at least officially they are defined as equals might correct the beliefs and gradually eradicate the caste feelings, without destroying the friendliness? Or would the disappearance of the caste distinction re- sult in a threat to self-esteem which would generate hostility? To my knowledge, there are no studies on attitude constellations of this sort, and the out- come should be quite instructive.
The research potential in school desegregation.
Many of these questions can be studied as well in situations of involuntary contact in the North as in desegregated schools in the South. Why then do I emphasize the importance of research in Southern schools? Partly, it is because of the scale on which desegregation is taking place in the South. It is estimated that more than 150,000 Negro children who formerly attended segregated schools are now in mixed classes for the first time. Since in most of the newly mixed schools Negro children are in the minority, it seems safe to estimate that about half a million white children are for the first time hav- ing contact with Negroes in school.
From the point of view of research, the sig- nificance of change on such a scale is the probability

that contact between Negro and white children will occur under a great variety of conditions and that this would make it possible to find contrasts which highlight the variable one is interested in studying. Moreover, the fact that the change is occurring in so many schools and so many communities means that similar combinations of variables will be re- peated, thus making it possible to replicate studies and so check the findings.
The situation also presents a second advantage. Because of the gradualness of the increase in the number of situations of involuntary contact in the North, it is difficult to find comparable or contrast- ing situations in which interracial contact is about to occur for the first time. Almost all studies have been carried out in situations where whites and Negroes were already in contact at the time of the investigation; initial attitudes had to be recalled by the respondents or inferred by the investigators on the basis of indirect evidence. In contrast, the fact that thousands of children in hundreds of southern communities will be attending mixed schools for the first time offers an unprecedented opportunity for research which can get direct evi- dence of initial attitude and in which the process of attitude change can be traced rather than in- ferred.
There is still another advantage—namely, the possibility of checking findings which seem fairly well substantiated in Northern studies, in settings where the over-all milieu is quite different. For example, it seems quite well established that, under certain combinations of circumstances—such as those obtaining in interracial public housing projects in the North—actual physical proximity of residence of whites to Negroes is an important determinant of favorableness of attitudes toward them. Would this finding hold in the quite different setting of a mixed school in a Southern town: will the white children who happen to be seated close to Negro children associate with them more, and become more friendly with them, than those who are seated farther away? Here I predict rather confidently that the answer will be yes.
PUBLIC POSITION-TAKING ON CONSEQUENTIAL ISSUES
You will recall that I said earlier that we could think of the events following the Supreme Court's decision partly in terms of the process of desegrega-
tion as I have been discussing it and partly in terms of decisions to desegregate or not to desegregate the schools in a given locality. Let me turn now to this latter aspect.
First we should note that we are involved here in an area of decision-making which is in many respects quite different from those that have been studied by social psychologists up to now. Most of the available studies have dealt with the effect of the conditions under which decisions are made on the subsequent behaviors of the people who decide. Considerable interest has focused on the process of decision-making in situations where the decisions do not have wider reverberations than the small groups in which they are made. Another focus has been upon decisions where the final act is completely private, as in voting behavior. In the present con- text, by contrast, we are concerned with the act of arriving at a public decision on consequential issues which inevitably involve large-scale public interest.
In relation to desegregation, it is developments in connection with these public decisions which make the headlines, although in my own opinion the real drama is played out in the schools and PTA's once desegregation gets under way. The daily papers bring us reports of reactions which run the gamut from decisions to desegregate immediately to state- ments that desegregation will never be accepted. For example, within twelve months after the Su- preme Court's first ruling—that is, even before the Court had issued any directives as to how and when desegregation was to be initiated—scattered com- munities in eight states, plus the District of Co- lumbia, had undertaken to desegregate their schools. On the other hand, seven states—Virginia, North and South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana—after the Court's second ruling, have passed legislation designed to preserve segregation. The Governor of Maryland announced immediately that his state was prepared to accept the Court's decision as the law of the land; by contrast, the Governor-elect of Mississippi has proposed legisla- tion which would make the advocacy of desegrega- tion a criminal offense and disbar any lawyer han- dling a desegregation case. Within Virginia, where the citizens were voting two to one against integra- tion in the public schools, the Catholic schools have already desegregated. Within Georgia, while the Governor was proclaiming that no white child in his state would ever have to attend school with a
￼Negro child, the Mayor of Atlanta was announcing that the city would abide by a Court ruling that golf courses must be open to all. While "white citizens' councils" to "defend states' rights and pre- serve racial purity" were being formed, such groups as the Southern Methodist Conference were pass- ing resolutions favoring desegregation.
What are we to make of this bewildering variety of reactions? Do we have in psychology an ap- proach to such events which would help us to see some order underlying the apparent confusion?
Before I try to suggest the direction which such an approach might take, let me outline tentatively some trends which I think can be observed in re- cent events in the South. It appears that, other things being equal, desegregation tends to proceed faster in cities than in rural areas, in border regions than in the deep South, in areas where the propor- tion of Negroes is small, and in areas where there has been a sizable influx of people from outside the South. Persons opposing desegregation seem to be older and less well-educated. Persons who support desegregation do so primarily on the basis of moral and religious allegiance, on the one hand, and on law-abiding grounds on the other. Desegregation seems to be accepted relatively easily within or- ganizations, such as the Army and the Catholic Church, which have strong and enforceable sanc- tions. Segregation is abandoned more easily when it conflicts with some other need than where there is no such opposing force; for example, a white person who, in a relatively empty train, will not sit next to a Negro may do so when the only vacant seat happens to be next to a Negro. And indi- viduals' views about segregation or integration tend to be brought into line with the position of im- portant reference groups.
While these trends, if they are correctly ob- served, suggest some orderlinessin the apparent con- fusion of events, they do not in themselves give us a basis for a psychological organization of our thinking in relation to an individual instance of de- cision making—such as, for example, might be represented by the vote of a member of the School Board of Knox County, Tennessee, on a proposal to desegregate the public schools of the county.
I think that most, if not all, of the complex phenomena that have been observed can be com- prehended within the framework of two groups of concepts: one having to do with variables which
may be related to the direction the decision takes, the other dealing with factors influencing the extent to which any given one of these possible variables becomes a weighty determinant of the position taken.
Some developments in the town of Hoxie, Ar- kansas, will illustrate what I mean. At the time of the Supreme Court's decision, the Hoxie School Board was in debt and discouraged about the pos- sibility of improving the financial situation. One of the heavier drains on the school district's budget was the cost of transporting a number of Negro students of high school age to a Negro high school in a nearby community and paying that community for their tuition. The Hoxie School Board inter- preted the first Supreme Court decision as in- validating the Arkansas law requiring racial segrega- tion. They saw the possibility of solving their financial crisis by enrolling the Negro high school students in their own high school, and decided to do this. To the outside observer this decision might well appear to be based upon a favorable reaction to racially mixed public schools, and it was widely interpreted in this way. Actually, it probably had no such implication whatsoever. Although the Board's public statement of reasons included refer- ence to religious and constitutional values, I under- stand from observers on the scene that the major factor in their decision was the financial one, that they took the step with great reluctance, and that their personal attitudes, like those of most of the other white residents of the community, favored separation of the races.
This example points to two variables which are potential determinants of the desegregation deci- sion: one, individual attitudes toward Negroes and toward segregation; the other, the incentive repre- sented by financial benefits to be gained by de- segregating. The school board made its decision in terms of the latter consideration; the community reacted in terms of its attitude toward segregation. What made the financial consideration the deter- mining one for the school board, who were in other respects not different from other members of the community? It seems clear that what is reflected here is the influence of role requirements. As mem- bers of the board of education, they were responsible for the school budget; it was this role requirement which made the economy of integrated schools the dominant consideration for them.

Some determinants of the direction of position- taking. A parallel to what we have found in Hoxie will be found in other situations. Some of the potential determinants of the decision, such as racial attitudes, are of the sort which recur regard- less of the specific situation, that is, they have an inherent psychological relation to the desegregation issue. Others, like the financial incentive, are not so related but are made relevant through the op- eration of some other factor.
Let me mention first some of the first type of variables—those which are inherently relevant to the desegregation decision. I have already referred, in the Hoxie example, to the variables of attitudes toward Negroes and toward racial separation. These attitudes involve both apprehensions and values directly relevant to the segregation issue. You will remember that one of the trends I thought I had noted is that less well-educated persons are likely to be more opposed to desegregation. A possible inference from this might be that underlying one s decision to support or oppose desegregation is a need for social status. For the less well-educated, being white and therefore upper caste, may be the only way in which this need is satisfied. If this is true, apprehension of a possible loss of status if Negro children attend schools on a basis of equality with white children might be expected to run higher for this segment of the population. Another ap- prehension relating directly to the possible effects of desegregation may be the fear of loss of political and economic power, particularly where Negroes are in the majority.
On the values side, the one most directly related to beliefs about the desirability of desegregation would seem to be the political or philosophical creed of the basic equality of individuals. In considering this value as a factor entering into the decision whether or not to desegregate, one would need to know not only its strength for a given individual but the extent to which it is compartmentalized and out of contact with segregation practices.
Factors influencing the relevance and strength of various determinants. I shall not attempt to list the variables which are not inherently related to the question of desegregation but which may be- come relevant through the operation of other factors; potentially they cover the whole range of human motivation. Rather, I should like to consider some of the major factors which can operate, first, to
bring these otherwise irrelevant variables into con- nection with the desegregation issue and second, to influence the strength of any given variable—• whether or not it is inherently related to desegrega- tion—in the decision.
One of these factors has been illustrated in the Hoxie example—that of the requirements of the role which the individual occupies. In that instance, the role requirements brought into prominence the financial incentive to desegregation. In other in- stances, role requirements may make community opinion the decisive variable. A local political leader, for example, is likely to be especially sensi- tive to community attitudes, since his continued occupation of his position is dependent on com-
munity approval.
Another factor which may bring seemingly un-
related variables into the segregation decision and which may also influence the relative strength of variables is the position taken by reference groups which are important to the individual. Let us say, for example, that an individual places great stress on respect for law. Before the Court's decision, this value exerted no force toward desegregation; in fact, in the South, the value of law-abidingness would operate in support of segregation. But the Court's ruling may bring the value of law-abiding- ness into play as a force toward desegregation, re- gardless of the individual's attitudes toward racial mingling. Thus, statements by officials in the border states have frequently had the following tone, "However we as individuals feel about de- segregation, as loyal citizens we will of course re- spect the authority of the nation's highest judicial body."
One can see a similar process with respect to face-to-face reference groups. Consider, for ex- ample, the fact that soon after the Court's decision school boards in a number of communities set up plans for studying means of desegregating, with every indication that they were inclined toward a decision to desegregate. As time went on there was a shift. In some cases little more was heard of the plan; in others the plan was explicitly postponed or abandoned. Or take such communities as Mil- ford, Delaware, where the decision to desegregate was officially made, but reconsidered as a result of strong community protests. In such situations, one may suppose that there was to begin with only one effective reference group—namely, the Supreme
￼Court. But as community opinion was mobilized, a new force entered into the situation—the posi- tion taken by a reference group which was closer not only physically but probably also psychologi- cally. This force brought into the complex of variables influencing the desegregation decision the desire for approval by persons who are important to the individual. This desire for social approval can be assumed to have existed in the board members all along, but it did not become an important varia- ble in the desegregation decision until the expres- sion of community opinion made it clear that a decision for desegregation would lead to disapproval.
A third factor which may connect otherwise ir- relevant variables with the desegregation decision is that of the ability of individuals or groups which have some authority over the individual to invoke sanctions which have objective consequences for him. Even if a group is not a reference group for a given individual, it may objectively have power over him which it can exert in order to bring him into line with its position. Thus, for a school board member who faces the possibility of prosecution for contempt of court, the desire to avoid the un- pleasantness of legal proceedings and a possible fine becomes relevant to the question of whether the community's schools are to be desegregated, and may outweigh his own attitudes and beliefs about segregation. The possibility of such sanctions is not limited to persons whose roles carry responsi- bility for the decision. For the man who faces loss of his job if he signs a petition urging desegrega- tion, or the lawyer threatened with disbarment if he represents a plaintiff in a desegregation suit, the need to earn a living becomes linked with his posi- tion on the desegregation issue. The weight which the variable thus invoked has in the decision is likely to bear a direct relation to the seriousness of the objective consequences for the individual's life. It is important to note that not everybody is equally vulnerable to such sanctions. Some individuals may be relatively immune, perhaps because of sup- port from a subgroup, or because of some unique aspects of their position, such as having an inde- pendent income.
I want to mention one last factor which may in- fluence the weight of a given variable in the deci- sion; this is an over-all change in the average strength of the variable wherever its influence is felt. We sometimes think of variables in the sense
that they have different strengths for different in- dividuals at a given time, but many of the variables which are likely to enter into the desegregation decision are of interest also in the sense that their average strength may be expected to change over time.
To illustrate, a variable whose strength through- out the country is likely to change over the next few years is the financial cost of continued segrega- tion—or, conversely, the financial rewards of de- segregation. The South, together with the rest of the country, will experience an intensification of the already serious problem of overcrowded schools. Where the need for additional school buildings is already an emergency, it will soon assume the na- ture of a crisis. As you know, the Federal govern- ment is about to embark upon a major program of financial aid to states for school construction. I believe it is unlikely that Federal aid will be given to states which are openly defying the Supreme Court, and it seems impossible that such aid could go to those which have shifted from public to private schools. This will mean that continued school segregation will cost more and more for in- creasingly less adequate schooling for white chil- dren. It is not impossible to imagine that this de- velopment, in itself, may become a basis for school desegregation, overriding beliefs and fears about the dangers of racial integration.
Another variable whose strength may be expected to change has to do with one aspect of the social norm toward desegregation. Recently a Columbia, South Carolina, newspaper complained in an edi- torial of the fact that some of the previously segre- gated states had gone ahead with plans for de- segregation. The writer indicated that this would make it harder for other states to hold out for segregation. As I have mentioned, desegregation is already under way in 8 of the 17 states which were segregated prior to the Court's decision. It is not unlikely that it will get under way in several addi- tional states in the not too distant future. As this happens, the social norms regarding segregation to which the decision-makers of the remaining states respond will become increasingly heterogeneous— some favoring and some opposing a change. One can guess that the effect of this will be to greatly weaken the social support for opposing the Court's decision, which is now one of the major factors at work in the still segregated states.

￼12 THE AMERICAN
PSYCHOLOGIST
The last considerations I shall mention in rela- tion to the desegregation decision—and on occasion they may be the most important—are those we traditionally encompass under the heading of per- sonality. Perhaps this is only a crude way of say- ing that when we have taken into account all of the factors that I have discussed up to now, there will remain striking variations in individual behavior still unaccounted for. When, for example, you con- sider the actions of a man like Governor Folsom of Alabama, situational determinants of behavior seem suddenly insignificant. Imagine a man—a poli- tician we might say under other circumstances—- situated in the very heart of the deep South, re- fusing to sign the legislature's pro-segregation bills and warning the Alabama Education Association against "the excessive noise being made by those who are guided by blind prejudice and bigotry" (10, Sept. 1955). Some such quality as that which Riesman has called inner-directedness—the extent of one's independence from social approval—must be invoked to make sense of the decisions of such
a person.
Let me make it clear, finally, that in identifying
these various determinants of desegregation de- cisions and suggesting some ways in which they may operate, I am not implying that such con- siderations put us in a position to predict and anticipate the decisions about desegregation which are yet to be made. The most I would claim for them is that they organize the available experience sufficiently to tell us where to look for some of the more crucial determinants of such decisions.
WILL THE NEEDED RESEARCH BE DONE?
I should like to be able to conclude my comments with the statement that the type of research I have been describing was being done or might soon get under way. Social scientists are agreed on the un- paralleled opportunity which the situation presents. It seems inconceivable in the face of this that we should not make a major effort to utilize the op- portunity. But as yet, with minor exceptions, we have available only a collection of case histories of school systems where desegregation has been initi- ated. Without detracting from their obvious value, it is clear that they can not give us the evidence in the form we need it if our understandingof social change is to be advanced. Nevertheless, with the
exception of research on some aspects of desegrega- tion in Washington carried out by Bower of Ameri- can University and Walker of Howard University, and a few small-scale and isolated investigations supported by funds from the Society for the Psy- chological Study of Social Issues (2, 7), I knowof no systematic work in progress or in prospect. And, worse yet, I am afraid the die has been cast and that little or no research is to be done.
Wherein lies the trouble? In view of the interest among social scientists, why do they not go ahead? The answer is that field research of the sort re- quired necessitates funds for research expenses and these are not available. Government agencies which sponsor research have felt they could not incur the enmity of congressmen who might reduce support for their research as a whole. But what about foundations? To my knowledge, the major founda- tions having interests in this area have all been asked for assistance and the answer has been uni- formly negative. Why this is so I, of course, do not know. I trust it may be only a coincidence that the recent congressional investigations of founda- tions were chaired by a southern congressman quite opposed to social change. If it is not, it is quite understandable, although regrettable, that such in- vestigations should have led to a more cautious ap- praisal of the wisdom of supporting research on controversial subjects.
It is a small consolation, but comforting, never- theless, to feel that we understand the events of this dramatic period in Americanhistory well enough to be able to conceive a fruitful research attack upon their meaning for social relations in general. That this attack is not to be prosecuted is a scien- tific tragedy of the first order. Being possessed of a great faith in the determination and ingenuity of my scientific colleagues, I can only hope that the tragedy may yet be averted.

Your Biography
You were born in New York, daughter of Italian immigrants, in 1908. Your father died when you were 1, after which your mother was alienated from your father's family. Since your mother had to work, you were raised primarily by your maternal grandmother and your uncle.  You were home-schooled until the age of 9. As a teenager, you became interested in mathematics, teaching yourself advanced trigonometry. At 13, you dropped out of high school and enrolled in Rhodes Preparatory School, whose primary mission is to train adults who needed basic eduction to get accepted in college.  After two years at Rhodes, you were accepted at Barnard College at the age of 15.
At Barnard, you were deeply influenced by Harry Hollingworth, chair of the Psychology department, as well as the work of Charles Spearman, an English statistician and psychologist who demonstrated that scores on most tests of mental abilities were correlated with one another, suggesting that there was a single general source of intelligence (see Spearman (1904)). You graduated from Barnard at 4 years later at 19, and were granted a PhD By Columbia one year later in 1929.
The year that you earned your doctorate, the stock market crashed, which caused the early part of your career to be defined by harsh economic times. Thanks to New Deal grants from the National Youth Administration and the Works Progress Administration (WPA), you were able to hire a few research assistants. You moved to Queens College in 1939, but felt that the administration did not fully support your fledgling psychology department. You moved again, this time to Fordham, in 1947, where you remain today.
You are often called the “test guru.'' Your 1954 text, ''Psychological Testing,'' is still required reading in undergraduate and graduate psychology courses and is considered a virtual bible for the field. The book, an encyclopedic review of how tests are constructed, validated and interpreted, received wide acclaim for its lucidity and depth of analysis. You took a special interest in the question of whether tests could be created that were free of cultural bias.  In the 1960's and 70's, while some in the field championed so-called ''culture fair'' tests, your argued that the claim that tests could be entirely unbiased was a fallacy. You ultimately argued that, “Tests can serve a predictive function only insofar as they indicate to what extent the individual has acquired the prerequisite skills and knowledge for a designated criterion performance. What persons can accomplish in the future depends not only on their present intellectual status, as assessed by the test, but on their subsequent experience (Anastasi, 1981).”
According to you, intelligence tests can do three things:
	“They permit a direct assessment of prerequisite intellectual skills demanded by many important tasks in our culture.
They assess availability of a relevant store of knowledge or content also prerequisite for many educational and occupational tasks.
They provide an indirect index of the extent to which the individual has developed effective learning strategies, problem-solving techniques and work habits and utilized them in the past.” (quoted on http://www.indiana.edu/~intell/anastasi.shtml from Anastasi, 1981).
You wrote that, "Intelligence is not a single, unitary ability, but rather a composite of several functions. The term denotes that combination of abilities required for survival and advancement within a particular culture (Anastasi, 1992, p. 613). ” Your research focused on understanding and measuring the factors underlying the development of individual differences in psychological traits (Anastasi, 1972, 1989). You argued against the strictly hereditarian position, emphasizing the role of experiential and environmental influences on intelligence test scores and psychological development. You stressed that intelligence test scores are not pure measures of innate ability, but that “...not only does the nature of one's antecedent experiences affect the degree of differentiation of "intelligence" into distinct abilities, but it also affects the particular abilities that emerge, such as verbal, numerical, and spatial abilities. Thus, experiential factors affect not only the level of the individual's intellectual development, but also the very categories in terms of which his abilities may be identified (Anastasi, 1972).”
In addition to your contributions to testing, you were renowned for your studies of individual and group differences and the interplay of biology and environment in shaping personality and intellectual development. You wrote more than 150 scholarly books, monographs and articles, and are said to have brought to the issue a balanced, deeply rational perspective and an insistence on solid science. You played a significant role in applying psychology to real-world situations, both through areas like industrial psychology and consumer psychology and in the clinical consulting room.
Game Objectives
Run for vice president in 1972, or until you get elected. Your expertise in statistics and understanding variability may come in very handy in the discussion of the 'normality' of sexual behavior.  You wish to present paper on the topic in 1972 or 1973.
If you are elected to a leadership position, it will be important to leave a legacy that can assist other women who wish to attain positions of such stature.  At the same time, you are crucially aware of the lack of serious research in either the psychological or psychiatric communities on the minds of women. Where women have been separated out for special study, the work is poor and misogynistic.  As president, then, you will be keenly interested in establishing institutional infrastructure that will both advance the study of women in a non-misogynistic way and provide leadership opportunities for future women in the discipline.
Notice that the official documents of the APA, as included in the game book, are written in gender-specific language: I.B states “a nonmember of the APA may read a paper provided that he is sponsored...”. The implication here is, of course, that a female nonmember is not allowed to present. As this document is an official representation of the policies of the APA, it should be clarified to reflect the policies of the organization.
You are neutral on the definition of mental illness. 
Specific Assignments
You are an initial member of the Program committee, with your term expiring in 1973. Review the model schedule in the gamebook, and solicit proposals from your peers. You should also get the program committee to propose gender-neutral language for the guidelines, and present your proposal to the board in 1971. 
Create two new standing committees of the APA: The Committee on Women in Psychology, which will focus on the issues facing women in the profession, and The Committee on the Psychology of Women, which will focus on studying women's minds as a specialization within the discipline.  From the current website of the committee on women in psychology:
Specifically, the committee will undertake the following priority tasks
(a) collection of information and documentation concerning the status of women;
(b) development of recommendations relevant to women;
(c) monitoring the implementation of guidelines and recommendations from reports issued by APA that are relevant to women;
(d) development of mechanisms to increase the participation of women in roles and functions both within and outside the profession;
(e) ongoing communications with other agencies and institutions regarding the status of women; and
(f) monitoring current issues relevant to the lives of women in order to inform policy.
The Committee shall consist of six members who are elected for staggered terms of three years.  It shall report to Council through the Board for the Advancement of Psychology in the Public Interest (BAPPI). (Approved by Council, February 2008)
Strategic Goals
Goal I  Promoting the health and well-being of women
Goal II  Identifying and eliminating discriminatory practices against women
Goal III Increasing the visibility of feminist scholarship and practice
Goal IV Promoting the unique contributions of women to psychology
Goal V  Enhancing women’s leadership within and outside of APA
Goal VI Collaborating with others as needed to achieve the empowerment of underrepresented groups
Goal VII Promoting the generation and communication of knowledge about women’s lives
And Division 35: the Society for the Psychology of Women:
Division 35: Society for the Psychology of Women provides an organizational base for all feminists, women and men of all national origins, who are interested in teaching, research, or practice in the psychology of women. The division recognizes a diversity of women's experiences which result from a variety of factors, including ethnicity, culture, language, socioeconomic status, age, and sexual orientation. The division promotes feminist research, theories, education, and practice toward understanding and improving the lives of girls and women in all their diversities; encourages scholarship on the social construction of gender relations across multicultural contexts; applies its scholarship to transforming the knowledge base of psychology; advocates action toward public policies that advance equality and social justice; and seeks to empower women in community, national, and global leadership. We welcome student members and affiliates. Members are provided two publications: Psychology of Women Quarterly, which is a journal of research, theory, and reviews, and the Feminist Psychologist.
Present a paper outlining psychometrics and the use of statistical measures in psychology. This should be connected, conceptually, to the problem of the the taxonomy of mental disorders. It is a good idea, then, to wait until after Spitzer presents the Feigner criteria in 1972. If elected president, it can be your presidential address. If not, it should be a regular paper.

            <Title>DFordney-Settlage</Title>
            <Text>D. Fordney Settlage, MD
Your Biography
You were born in 1940. You became an American physician and sex therapist best known for your work on sexual function and dysfunction. Your BS is from the University of Arizona (1960) and your  MD (1964) from University of California at Los Angeles.
You began your career looking at sperm motility after intercourse, but you've also been interested in the sexual experiences among teenaged girls.
You are currently working on a comprehensive overview of heterosexual dysfunction. You served as Assistant Professor, Obstetrics and Gynecology Division of Reproductive Biology at the Los Angeles County-USC Medical Center.
You were an early critic of gynecologist James C. Burt, sometimes called the 'Love Surgeon' and his involuntary surgeries on the vulvas of patients. Burt performed a number of reconstructive surgeries (perhaps hundreds) on women who had recently given birth, when they were still under the effects of episiotomy.  In his words 'Women are structurally inadequate for intercourse. This is a pathological condition amenable to surgery.'' In franker terms, he also said that his surgery would turn women into ''horny little mice'' and asserted that ''the difference between rape and rapture is salesmanship.'' (1957, quoted in a 1988 NY Times article following his censorship by the Ohio Medical Board). You, as D. Fordney-Settlage has said, "Dr. Burt is a nice person but he is a zealot and that makes him dangerous."
During your tenure at the University of Arizona Medical Center’s fertility clinic, you assisted in helping hundreds of couples with fertility issues bring babies to term. During the course of your career, a debate ensued as to whether the availability of contraceptives was promoting pre-marital sex.
You conducted a study of 500 unwed teenage girls (aged 13-17) that had sought professional help in obtaining contraceptives. Your findings provided sound grounds to conclude that not only did the availability of contraceptives fail in promoting sexual behavior, but that a lack of contraceptive availability would not deter teenage girls from participating in sexual behavior. The study demonstrated the sexual behavior in teenage girls pre-dated the use of contraceptives, and that when available, teenage girls would make use of such options in order to prevent unwanted pregnancy, impediments to future and current education, forced marriage, illegitimacy, and abortion.
Game Objectives
You primary objective is to get on the Spitzer taskforce to advocate for psychosexual disorders in the new taxonomy. Make certain that female sexuality is not maligned as a psychological disorder in the DSM-III or the definition of 'mental health.'  Your secondary objective is to advocate for women's sexual health more broadly.  You have a long-standing friendship with both Richard Green and Harold Lief.
There is very little research on women's sexuality. Kinsey's famous study causes a good deal of consternation. Even today, the issue of homosexuality seems largely to be about male homosexuality, with lesbianism hardly mentioned as an afterthought. Work with Leona Tyler in her efforts to get a Committee on Women in Psychology, and more importantly for you, the Committee on the Psychology of Women.
The issue of female sexuality has become particularly hot recently with the popularization of oral contraceptives.  While most people favor contraceptives for women who are already sexually active, there is a great controversy over whether allowing young women access to contraceptives will make  sexually active. You are interested in settling that question.
You are neutral on the definition of mental illness, so long as it isn’t gendered in some tacit way.
Specific Assignments
In 1972, propose to the research committee a study on the sexual experiences of younger women who are seeking contraceptives for the first time, based on her actual 1973 paper.  
As you straddle the fence between the MD and PhDs, the Medical doctors and the Psychologists, you are in the unique position to create a compromise between Albee and _____ regarding the rights and duties of the psychologists and psychiatrists in the treatment of patients in 1972.
In 1975, give a paper critiquing the history of psychiatric and psychological theory of sexuality as overly focused on male sexuality. You should be specific here – the game book appendicies contain the small amount of work by Freud on Lesbianism, and Krafft-Ebbing's Psychopathia Sexualis contains a brief mention at the very end.  Jung's theories of female homosexuality are worth exploring as well.  Consider how 'normal' sexual maturation has been defined in male terms, and how the explanations are inequal (i.e. compare the 'Oedipal complex' to the 'Electra complex'). This will take some work. Be specific and as thorough as you can – it will be important to consider as the DSM-III is considered.

Frank Kameny Biography
You were born in Queens, New York to a middle class Jewish family. Your first academic interest was in science, and by the age of seven, you pledged your commitment in becoming an astronomer. You began your undergraduate degree in physics at Queens College, but you were interrupted by WWII, where you served as an Army Mortar crewman in Europe.  Your mother described you as excessively shy, but your time spent abroad during WWII brought you out of your shell. You returned from the war, finished your undergraduate degree, and went on to receive your PhD in physics from Harvard University in 1956 after being awarded a scholarship.
You have a dominating personality that is a cross between egotism and revolutionary. You have a habit of questioning the status quo and supporting your own conceptions. When you were a teenager, you proclaimed yourself an atheist to your parents. This attitude continued into your teaching fellow years at Harvard where you refused to sign a loyalty oath without attaching qualifiers, stating, “If society and I differ on something, I am willing to give the matter a second look…If we still differ, than I am right and society is wrong.”
Kameny was not so much concerned with changing society in so much as he refused to let society effect his own life. You avoided the exploration of your sexuality, and were therefore unsure of your orientation. You preferred spending your time in observatories. While finishing your dissertation in Arizona, you became friendly with a group of homosexuals and attended a gay bar, to which you stated, “I’ve come home”. You took full advantage of your sexual revelation, and spent the near future making up for lost time.
After receiving your doctorate, you worked as teaching assistant for the astronomy department at Georgetown University, before transferring to the Army Map Service in the heat of the Cold War. During this phase of life, you helped the army more accurately target their nuclear weapons by using points around the U.S to calculate the distance towards targets around the world. In 1957, Army security officials questioned your sexuality, to which you responded by asserting that your personal life was not the business of the federal government. You were immediately dismissed, leaving you jobless and dependent upon charity during the dawn of the space race; a time that should have been the greatest opportunity of your life.  The Federal government’s position was that homosexuality made a person unsuitable for federal employment. You had been dismissed just as hundreds had been before you, but you became the first to ever officially challenge this policy. Initially, legal efforts failed, and even your lawyer determined it best to abandon the case. You pressed on, outlining a case in which you argued that the discrimination you experienced was no less illegal and no less odious than discrimination based upon religious or racial grounds. After citing the Kinsey report, you presented reasonable grounds to believe that 15 million U.S citizens were gay and subject to the same persecution.
When the Supreme Court refused to hear the case once more, you moved to create a movement by founding the Mattachine Society of Washington, which was named after a group of medieval court jesters who were allowed to articulate unpopular truths under the secrecy of masks. The Mattachine Society of Washington was one of the first homosexual organizations to act under the mission of political activism, and focus its efforts on public awareness; its mission: “to act by any lawful means to secure for homosexuals the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness”.  Your influence stemmed heavily from surveying the black civil rights movement, and you eventually shifted homosexuality from a mental health issue to a civil liberties issue. You argued that your opposition was basing its arguments on emotion rather than reason, which prevented the pursuit of education and awareness. You claimed that homosexuals were more likely to have an employment issue than they were a mental health issue due to their sexual orientation.
You enacted a civil rights militancy strategy, taking to the streets, media, and the courts. Although your movement was legally focused, you understood that homosexuality’s classification as an illness was the main obstacle to overcome. You used your background in the sciences to demonstrate that the current view of homosexual psychology was based on psychiatric observations made on behalf of mental patients only, thus ignoring the millions of healthy gay Americans spread throughout the country. Your organization was the first that claimed homosexuality to be, “a preference, orientation, or propensity, on par with, and not different in kind from, heterosexuality”.  However, negative stigmas for homosexuality existed in propensity, thus counteracting the logic of your claims. You modeled a slogan after the African American movement’s, “Black is Beautiful”, thus coining the phrase, “Gay is Good”. America loves slogans, and the country’s “gut” began to shift into your corner. Today you are considered a pioneer in the homosexual civil rights movements, and cited as one of its most important figures.
When the Department of Defense launched an investigation into the sexuality of a young man named Benning Wentworth in 1969, you took the opportunity to testify. Charles Socarides was an expert witness for the prosecution. Your speech, “We Throw Down the Gauntlet” is not a classic in the gay rights movement. It is available here: http://www.kamenypapers.org/gauntlet.htm.
Barbara Gittings Biography
You are a Librarian, activist and a pioneer of the American gay rights movement. You founded the New York chapter of the Daughters of Bilitis and edited its magazine, The Ladder. One of your life-long goals has been to get public libraries to provide more information on homosexuality to the public.
You were born on July 31, 1932 in Vienna, Austria. Your father, a career diplomat, was transferred back to the US in 1940, and your family settled in Delaware.
During your freshman year at Northwestern in 1949, you sought out therapy because you believed you might be a lesbian. The psychotherapist offered to cure you. Rather than submit to treatment, you went to the libraries to find information on homosexuality. The few resources you discovered were filed under 'perverted' or 'abnormal.' Moreover, the material on offer dealt almost exclusively with gay men.
As a result of the time you spent in the library researching homosexuality, you failed out of Northwestern. When you returned 'back east,' you moved to Philadelphia.
But you continued your research. In Philadelphia, you discovered a book titled The Homosexual in America (1951), written under the pseudonym 'Donald Webster Cory .'  You contacted the publisher and eventually contacted the author Edward Sagarin, who introduced you to the fledgling homophile movement, including the Mattachine Society.
When you went out to California to meet with the publishers of ONE, you met Phyllis Lyon and Del Martin, leaders of the lesbian organization Daughters of Bilitis. They asked you to found a chapter in New York, even though it meant a commute from Philly. You accepted.  
At a DOB meeting in 1961, you met another activist named Kay Lahusen. The two of you fell in love and soon became partners for life.
You succeeded Lyon and Martin as editor of DOB's magazine, The Ladder. During your three-year editorship, The Ladder began to publish articles critiquing medical authorities as well as the notion that homosexuals were sick.
In the early 1960's, your position in the DOB lead you to meet and collaborate with Frank Kameny.  Kameny's Washington DC chapter of the Mattachine Society was becoming more and more aggressive in its public advocacy, and you were encouraged. In 1965, you joined Kameny in a picket of  the White House. And the two of you organized annual demonstrations on July 4 at Independence Hall in Philly.
These tactics were not entirely welcome in the community at the time. You left the DOB because of these conflicts and joined Kameny's Mattachine society full time.
Game Objectives
You are the leader of the Gay-PA. After the Stonewall protests of 1969, you've become committed to the idea that street-level protests and direct nonviolent confrontation ('Zaps') are the most effective mechanisms of social change.  You organized the San Francisco protests of 1970, and you have some ideas for 1971 and 1972.
The Gay-PA (in reality, the Chicago branch of the Gay Liberation Front) should issue something like following proclamation at the beginning of the conference in 1971 (distribute it as you see fit – i.e. post it to the door of the room, hand it out as players enter, etc.). It is vital that the draft is approved by the other members of the Gay-PA (Fryer, Hooker, Gold), and you should consult the secret 'young turks' (Marmor, Spiegel):
The establishment school of psychiatry is based on the premise that people who are hurting should solve their problems by “adjusting” to the situation. For the homosexual, this means becoming adept at straight-fronting, learning how to survive in a hostile world, how to settle for housing in the gay ghetto, how to be satisfied with a profession in which homosexuals are tolerated, and how to live with low self-esteem.
The adjustment school places the burden on each individual homosexual to learn to bear his torment. But the “problem” of homosexuality is never solved under this scheme; the anti-homosexualist attitude of society, which is the cause of the homosexual's trouble, goes unchallenged.  And there's always another paying patient on the psychiatrist's couch.
Dr. Socarides claims, “A human being is sick when he fails to function in his appropriate gender identity, which is appropriate to his anatomy.” Who determines “appropriateness”? The psychiatrist as moralist? Certainly there is no scientific basis for defining “appropriate” sexual behavior.... Other than invoking moral standards, Dr. Socarides claims that homosexuality is an emotional illness because of the guilt and anxieties in homosexual life.  Would he als consider Judaism an emotional illness because of the paranoia which Jews experienced in Nazi Germany?
We homosexuals of gay liberation believe that the adjustment school of therapy is not a valid approach to society.
We refuse to adjust to our oppression, and believe that the key to our mental health, and to the mental health of all oppressed peoples in a racist, sexist, capitalist society, is a radical change in the structure and accompanying attitudes of the entire social system.
Mental health for women does not mean therapy for women—it means the elimination of male supremacy. Not therapy for blacks, but an end to racism. The poor don't need psychiatrists (what a joke at 25 bucks a throw!)--they need democratic distribution of wealth. OFF THE COUCHES, INTO THE STREETS!
We see political organizing and collective action as the strategy for effecting this social change. We declare that we are healthy homosexuals in a sexist society, and that homosexuality is at least on part with heterosexuality as a way for people to relate to each (know any men that don't dominate women?).
Since the prevalent notion in society is that homosexuality is wrong, all those who recognize that this attitude is damaging to people, and that it must be corrected, have to raise their voices in opposition to antihomosexualism.  Not to do so is to permit the myth of homosexual pathology to continue and to comply in the homosexual's continued suffering from senseless stigmatization... We furthermore urge psychiatrists to refer to the homosexual patients to gay liberation (and other patients who are the victims of oppression to relevant liberation movements). Once relieved of patients whose guilt is not deserved but imposed, psychiatrists will be able to devote all their efforts to the rich—who do earn their guilt but not their wealth, and can best afford to pay psychiatrists'' fees.
We are convinced that a picket and a dance will do more for the vast majority of homosexuals that two years on the couch.  We call on the medical profession to repudiate the adjustment approach as a solution to homosexual oppression and instead to further homosexual liberation by working in a variety of political ways (re-educating the public, supporting pickets, attending rallies, promoting social events, etc.) to change the situation of homosexuals in this society.
Join us in the struggle for a world in which all humans are free to love without fear or shame.
(quoted in Rosario, 2002)

As a non-member of the APA, you cannot vote on the definition of mental illness. But be sure to advocate for one that does not penalize or marginalize those with harmless social differences.
Specific Assignments
Participate in the 1971 panel discussion with John Fryer and Evelyn Hooker. The texts of Kameny and Gitting's actual speeches are not recorded (to my knowledge), but Gittings' was probably titled “Gay, Proud and Healthy.”  Eyewitnesses record that Kameny was more confrontational and antagonistic to psychiatry while Gittings was more conciliatory. Kameny is quoted as arguing that “We're rejecting you all as our owners. We possess ourselves and we speak for ourselves and we will take care of our destines.” (Quoted in Bayer, 2002 p. 106).
As B. Gittings, propose a study, similar to E. Hookers, on lesbians, recruiting from the Daughters of Bilitis in 1971.  You can see the gamemaster or the original Siegelman, 1972.
Petition the conference committee for a display booth for 1972 titled 'Gay, Proud and Healthy', get Fryer and others to sit at the booth and take questions. As a student, if you are interested, there are photos of the actual booth available at http://digitalgallery.nypl.org/nypldigital/id?1606166. You should distribute a pamplet as well (the Kameny papers archive has a copy of the original, for inspiration).
You should maintain 'zapping' events where you determine discrimination, or the intellectual basis for discrimination, occur.
Help organize a symposium in 1973 on the topic of “Should Homosexuality Be in the APA Nomenclature?”

            <Title>GAlbee</Title>
            <Text>George W. Albee, PhD
Your Biography
You are George W. Albee, Clinical Psychologist and thorn in the side of Psychiatry. You were born in St. Mary's PA, but attended Bethany College in WV as an undergraduate.  You served in the Air Force from 1943-1946, after which you started graduate school in Clinical Psychology at the University of Pittsburgh. After receiving your PhD in 1949, you joined the Western Psychiatric Institute as a Research Associate, where you worked until 1951.
In 1951, you joined Harry Harlow's wife and two others as the staff of the APA. During that time, not only did you come to understand the inner workings of this vast organization, but you actually drafted some of the committee structures.  In 1953, you won a Fulbright grant to spend a year teaching Psychiatry at Helsinki University, Finland. When you returned to the States in 1954, you accepted an  associate professorship at Western Reserve University in Cleveland, where you still teach.
In the 1950s, you chaired an APA taskforce on resources available for mental health professionals. This taskforce culminated in your Mental Health Manpower Trends (1959), which made clear the need for proactive, preventative mental health needs rather than the traditional reactive psychoanalytic approach.
Your service to the APA is nothing short of astonishing. In the words of a close friend:
“He served at various times as program chair of the APA annual convention; as a participant in the Miami, Chicago, Vail, and Utah clinical training conferences; as a member of the Board of Professional Affairs and the Ethics Committee; and (on numerous occasions) as a member of the Council of Representatives. He was president of Division 12 (Clinical) in 1966—1967 and [item removed for game coherence]. He has also served on and chaired innumerable APA committees, including the Commission on the Composition of Council that established the current voting system that guarantees one vote per person. “

In 1964, you wrote “A declaration of independence for psychology,” which called for psychologists to withdraw from psychiatric facilities and set up their own centers for treatment of individuals with mental problems.  More recently, you have started worrying publicly that the ‘medical model’ of mental life in terms of ‘health’ and ‘illness’ is lacking. Your 1969 paper “Emerging concepts of mental illness and models of treatment: The psychological point of view” articulates your view on this matter. Roughly, the ‘sickness model’ assumes three things that are not true of mental disturbances or disturbed behavior: (1) that mental conditions are separate, discrete mental illnesses each of which has a separate cause, prognosis and treatment, (2) that treatment of these conditions is the sole responsibility of a specially trained ‘physician’ and (3) that the source of the disturbances are to be found in the individual, rather than in the world, thus focusing all ‘treatment’ effort on the individual rather than the social conditions which may give rise to his or her disturbed behavior.

Your life-long commitment to preventative therapy has caused you to butt heads with defenders of the older way of doing things on various occasions. Your work is typified by three basic trends: (1) the independence of psychology from psychiatry and biology, (2) the inappropriateness of the illness model for mental and emotional disorders, and (3) the role of social injustice and inequality in mental health—both in how social injustice causes mental and emotional disorders and how prejudices have formed mental health taxonomies and diagnostics.
According to you, mediating factors such as social support, self-esteem and healthy coping skills have a more profound effect on the incidence of mental and emotional disorders than any conceivable trauma, defense mechanism, or reaction. Echoing the medical truism that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure, you believe that stamping out racism, sexism, ageism and homophobia (as well as other prejudices) would do more to alleviate mental and emotional disorders than all the psychoanalysis that all the psychoanalysts could possibly provide.
 In your own words, the 1960s found you embroiled in a “continuing, often acrimonious debate with psychiatry over the inappropriateness of the illness model of mental and emotional disorder and over medical hegemony.”
Game Objectives
Find opportunities to articulate and promote your vision of psychology as an alternative to psychiatry, including the importance of preventative treatment. One obvious way to do this is to run for president as soon as possible. If you are unable to be elected president, seek a paper presentation during which you can present your vision of preventative mental health.
If and when the game gets to the point where the definition of mental illness is addressed, work with Thomas Szasz to ensure that no definition that assumes an ‘illness’ metaphor or medical model, or makes a tacit preference for psychiatry against psychology.
Specific Assignment
If you class is larger than 16, you'll start as the board-member-at-large, serving from '71-'73.
Organize a symposium with Thomas Szasz on the suitability of the medical model for psychiatric treatment.  This will be best in 1972 before the debate on the DSM-III is taking place.
There will likely be a proposal to limit the treatment of mentally disordered patients to psychiatrists, you should not only fight against it, but propose a separate system of treatment run entirely by psychologists.  Your proposal should call for the establishment of various centers that would train, certify and deliver mental health services, in competition with psychiatry.  Check out 'Ethical Standards' item 7.i, which was added in 1968.
You will need to provide guidance and support to Robert Spitzer, as his task force attempts to write its report. At the same time, you are a strong ally of those trying to get homosexuality removed from the DSM.

Game Note:
George W. Albee was Emeritus Professor of Psychiatry at the University of Vermont.  His web page contains links to his work, and a biography, from which much of the information in this character sheet was pulled. http://www.uvm.edu/~galbee/. He died in 2006.

Your Biography
You are Kenneth Clark, a psychologist, educator, and social reformer dedicated to understanding and eradicating racial injustice.  You grew up in Harlem, attending the integrated schools of NY City, but attended college at Howard University in D.C. There, you met Mamie Phipps, who eventually became your wife, and with whom you authored numerous studies on the psychological damage caused by segregation and racism. You were the first African American to receive a Doctorate in Psychology from Columbia, and the first black permanent professor at City College of New York, where you still teach.
In addition to your excellent academic collaboration with Mamie, together you founded Harlem's Northside Center for Child Development in 1946, with the mission to “fosters the healthy development of children and families and seeks to empower them to respond constructively to negative societal factors including racism and its related consequences. Through comprehensive, high quality mental health and educational services, coupled with research, children and families are aided in developing to their full potential.”
In your most famous study (co-authored with Mamie), you presented four identical plastic dolls that different only with respect to color to black children between the ages of three and seven. When asked which doll they preferred, the majority selected the white doll. When asked to color in a drawing 'the same color' as themselves, most of the black children choose yellow or white crayons.  You concluded that “prejudice, discrimination, and segregation” had caused the children to develop a sense of self-hatred and inferiority.
The study become something of a sensation, and it is still included in most introductory psychology textbooks. It's effects, however, were much more profound that that.
In 1950, You (Kenneth), wrote a summary of the paper for the Midcentury White House Conference on Children and Youth.  The summary was read, ultimately, by Robert Carter, who was one of the NAACP lawyers pushing the various cases challenging segregation that ultimately were consolidated into the pivotal 1954 Brown v. The Board of Education decision.  The NAACP contracted you as an expert witness for at least three cases: Briggs v. Elliot (South Carolina) , Davis v. County School Board of Prince Edward County and Belton v. Gebhart (Delaware). You co-authored the summation that was ultimately endorsed by leading social scientists at the time when it went before the Supreme court.
Writing for a unanimous court, Chief Justice Warren stated
“Does segregation of children in public schools solely on the basis of race, even though the physical facilities and other "tangible" factors may be equal, deprive the children of the minority group of equal educational opportunities? We believe that it does.”
Quoting from the appellate court (which actually ruled against the NAACP), Chief Justice Warren argued:
 "Segregation of white and colored children in public schools has a detrimental effect upon the colored children. The impact is greater when it has the sanction of the law; for the policy of separating the races is usually interpreted as denoting the inferiority of the negro group. A sense of inferiority affects the motivation of a child to learn. Segregation with the sanction of law, therefore, has a tendency to [retard] the educational and mental development of negro children and to deprive them of some of the benefits they would receive in a racial[ly] integrated school system."  

Whatever may have been the extent of psychological knowledge at the time of Plessy v. Ferguson, this finding is amply supported by modern authority.11  Any language [347 U.S. 483, 495]   in Plessy v. Ferguson contrary to this finding is rejected.

Footnote 11, which supports the central finding of Brown, cites your 1950 memo “Effect of Prejudice and Discrimination on Personality Development.”
In the 1896 case Plessy v. Ferguson, the Supreme court ruled that so long as railroad accommodations were 'separate but equal', the state of Louisiana was allowed to enforce racial segregation.  The court reasoned that laws which kept races separated did not necessarily entail the inferiority of one to the other. Your study was pivotal in the Warren's court rejection of that idea.
Brown v. Board of Education was not only a milestone in the modern civil rights movement, it also made you into something of an academic superstar. You went on to become the most influential black social scientist of your generation. You received honorary degrees from more than a dozen of the nation's finest colleges and universities, but your larger goal of integrated, adequate schooling for blacks had not become a reality even four decades after the announcement of the monumental court decision.
In the 1960s, you helped establish the Harlem Youth Opportunities Unlimited, a project that influenced President Lyndon Johnson's War on Poverty program.
Your many books include Prejudice and Your Child (1955), Dark Ghetto: Dilemmas of Social Power (1965), and The Negro American (1966).  
Game Objectives
As an initial member of the Research committee, you'll be called upon to judge the scientific legitimacy and ethical acceptability of proposed research programs.  You should make yourself familiar with the sections of the game book titled 'A Primer on Research Methods' and 'Ethics of Human Research'.  Your gamemaster will give you an additional sheet outlining the responsibilities of members of the research committee in evaluating proposals.  In the first year, you are likely to get a proposal to the research committee that proposes an experiment on a child. It is vital that you prompt the committee as a whole to seriously consider the nature of 'consent' in the context of  power dynamics and social inequality.

Oppose the passing of the 'Leona Tyler principle', which states:
“As citizens, members of the APA have the right to advocate for any cause through the myriad of political advocacy organizations, but when psychologists and psychiatrists speak for the profession through APA public stances and proclamations, it should be from science and professional experience.  
On occasion psychiatrists are asked for an opinion about an individual who is in the light of public attention or who has disclosed information about himself/herself through public media. In such circumstances, a psychiatrist may share with the public his or her expertise about psychiatric issues in general. However, it is unethical for a psychiatrist to offer a professional opinion unless he or she has conducted an examination and has been granted proper authorization for such a statement.”

Get elected president.  That can be before or after your symposium.

You are neutral on the definition of mental illness. 
Specific Assignments
Organize, propose and participate in a symposium on the role of psychology as a mechanism of social change or more generally, on the social responsibilities of scientists, preferably in 1973.  Chomsky and Marmor may be a good choices as a co-panelists. You should present a paper on psychology's role for social good. If you are elected president, it should be your presidential address. If not, it can be a part of the symposium.
In 1975, propose an affirmative action plan for psychology and psychiatry. Here's the real language. You should adapt it to your needs:
THERE IS a continuous need to increase the number of minority psychiatrists; the American Psychiatric Association has consistently demonstrated its commitment to the principle of affirmative action as reflected in its efforts of recruitment and training of minority psychiatrists. APA has previously developed and instituted policies recognizing and supporting the special mental health issues of minority populations; however, there are serious threats to affirmative action programs that have facilitated the following endeavors: APA reaffirms these commitments and policies by 1) issuing a public statement drawing attention to the potential deleterious effects that such threats pose to the delivery of health services to minority groups; 2) actively participating with other professional and educational groups to assure continued recruitment and training of minority candidates in medical disciplines; and 3) further exploring and developing, through its appropriate components, mechanisms to assure continued implementation of these commitments.

Biography
You were born in Kentucky in 1938. You were an academically talented kid who entered Medical School at Vanderbilt at the age of 19. After completing your internship at Ohio State, you moved to Philadelphia, where you still live today.
You are often described as a “large” man, both in body and personality. While others describe you as “flamboyant” and “outspoken,” you prefer “farm boy.”  But you recognize that you can be combative and gruff in pursuit of your ideals. These attributes have not always made your life easy, especially since you are gay.  You were forced to leave the University of Pennsylvania's psychiatry residency program when your sexual orientation was discovered (recall that mentally ill people cannot practice psychiatry), but were able to complete your certification at Norristown State Hospital in Philadelphia.
You eventually were hired into the psychiatric department of the hospital of Temple University, where you remain. Talented in multiple things, you serve as the organist for St. Peter's Episcopal Church in Germantown, the neighborhood of Philadelphia where you live.
You are also a member of the secret organization of gay psychiatrists who quietly met at APA meetings, known unofficially as the “Gay-PA.”
Game Objectives
Calling yourself 'Dr. H. Anonymous', give a talk entitled “I am a homosexual, and a psychiatrist.” during the 1971 panel discussion “Psychiatry: Friend or Foe to Homosexuals: A Dialogue” wearing a mask. The mask is really a bit of theater – everyone who matters knows who you really are. But you're making a point: that mentally ill people cannot practice psychiatry. And as homosexuality is classified as a mental illness, so technically, homosexuals should not be allowed to practice psychiatry. But they do – many homosexuals are very good psychiatrists, including yourself. It follows, therefore, that the classification is not only unhelpful to homosexuals themselves, it is actually harming the discipline of psychiatry.
The text of Dr. H. Anonymous' speech was widely available on the internet, but as of Feb, 2011, it appears to have been removed. I'll included it below, but it is important that your speech models the original, not replicates it. You need to write this in your own words, but making arguments that are along the same lines as the original.
Work with your fellow Gay-PA members to remove 'homosexuality' from the DSM and opposing any attempt to reintroduce any substitute classification.
In 1974, propose that the deem ban the use of aversion therapy in the treatment of homosexuality immoral.  You should research some of the first-hand stories available on http://www.treatmentshomosexuality.org.uk/ to make your case.\
You are neutral on the definition of mental illness. 
Must Read
Dr. H. Anonymous speech:
"Thank you, Dr. Robinson. I am a homosexual. I am a psychiatrist. I, like most of you in this room, am a member of the APA and am proud to be a member. However, tonight I am, insofar as in it is possible, a ‘we.’ I attempt tonight to speak for many of my fellow gay members of the APA as well as for myself. When we gather at these conventions, we have a group, which we have glibly come to call the Gay-PA. And several of us feel that it is time that real flesh and blood stand up before you and ask to be listened to and understood insofar as that is possible. I am disguised tonight in order that I might speak freely without conjuring up too much regard on your part about the particular WHO I happen to be. I do that mostly for your protection. I can assure you that I could be any one of more than a hundred psychiatrists registered at this convention. And the curious among you should cease attempting to figure out who I am and listen to what I say.
"We homosexual psychiatrists must persistently deal with a variety of what we shall call ‘Nigger Syndromes.’ We shall describe some of them and how they make us feel.
"As psychiatrists who are homosexual, we must know our place and what we must do to be successful. If our goal is academic appointment, a level of earning capacity equal to our fellows, or admission to a psychoanalytic institute, we must make certain that no one in a position of power is aware of our sexual orientation or gender identity. Much like the black man with the light skin who chooses to live as a white man, we cannot be seen with our real friends - our real homosexual family - lest our secret be known and our dooms sealed. There are practicing psychoanalysts among us who have completed their training analysis without mentioning their homosexuality to their analysts. Those who are willing to speak up openly will do so only if they have nothing to lose, then they won’t be listened to.
"As psychiatrists who are homosexuals, we must look carefully at the power which lies in our hands to define the health of others around us. In particular, we should have clearly in our minds, our own particular understanding of what it is to be a healthy homosexual in a world, which sees that appellation as an impossible oxymoron. One cannot be healthy and be homosexual, they say. One result of being psychiatrists who are homosexual is that we are required to be more healthy than our heterosexual counterparts. We have to make some sort of attempt through therapy or analysis to work problems out. Many of us who make that effort are still left with a sense of failure and of persistence of "the problem." Just as the black man must be a super person, so must we, in order to face those among our colleagues who know we are gay. We could continue to cite examples of this sort of situation for the remainder of the night. It would be useful, however, if we could now look at the reverse.
"What is it like to be a homosexual who is also a psychiatrist? Most of us Gay-PA members do not wear our badges into the Bayou Landing [a gay bar in Dallas] or the local Canal Baths. If we did, we could risk the derision of all the non-psychiatrist homosexuals. There is much negative feeling in the homosexual community towards psychiatrists. And those of us who are visible are the easiest targets from which the angry can vent their wrath. Beyond that, in our own hometowns, the chances are that in any gathering of homosexuals, there is likely to be any number of patients or paraprofessional employees who might try to hurt us professionally in a larger community if those communities enable them to hurt us that way.
"Finally, as homosexual psychiatrists, we seem to present a unique ability to marry ourselves to institutions rather than wives or lovers. Many of us work 20 hours daily to protect institutions that would literally chew us up and spit us out if they knew the truth. These are our feelings, and like any set of feelings, they have value insofar as they move us toward concrete action.
"Here, I will speak primarily to the other members of the Gay-PA who are present, not in costume tonight. Perhaps you can help your fellow psychiatrist friends understand what I am saying. When you are with professionals, fellow professionals, fellow psychiatrists who are denigrating the "faggots" and the "queers," don’t just stand back, but don’t give up your careers, either. Show a little creative ingenuity; make sure you let your associates know that they have a few issues that they have to think through again. When fellow homosexuals come to you for treatment, don’t let your own problems get in your way, but develop creative ways to let the patient know that they’re all right. And teach them everything they need to know. Refer them to other sources of information with basic differences from your own so that the homosexual will be freely able to make his own choices.
"Finally, pull up your courage by your bootstraps, and discover ways in which you and homosexual psychiatrists can be closely involved in movements which attempt to change the attitudes of heterosexuals - and homosexuals - toward homosexuality. For all of us have something to lose. We may not be considered for that professorship. The analyst down the street may stop referring us his overflow. Our supervisor may ask us to take a leave of absence. We are taking an even bigger risk, however, not accepting fully our own humanity, with all of the lessons it has to teach all the other humans around us and ourselves. This is the greatest loss: our honest humanity. And that loss leads all those others around us to lose that little bit of their humanity as well. For, if they were truly comfortable with their own homosexuality, then they could be comfortable with ours. We must use our skills and wisdom to help them - and us - grow to be comfortable with that little piece of humanity called homosexuality."

            <Text>Jean Piaget, PhD
Your Biography
You were born in 1896 in Switzerland to Arthur Piaget, a professor of medieval literature at Neuchâtel University. You write, late in life, that you Mother's poor mental health 'intensly interested' in questions of psychology and psychoanalysis. This interest did not manifest at first, however, as your first passion was natural history. Many commentators have asserted this interest was born of an aversion to anything fantastical or hallucinatory. At the age of 11, you started to work with Paul Godet, Director of the Natural History Museum at Neuchâtel, on molluscs.  This work was so successful that when you were only 15, Maurice Bedot, director of the Natural History Museum at Geneva, offered you a position as an assistant in malacology.  You declined, explaining that you were too young.
You went to the University of Neuchâtel to study natural sciences, but happened upon a series of lectures by Carl Jung while spending a semester at the University of Zurich. After completing your Doctorate, you took a job teaching at a boy's school in France established by the psychologist  Alfred Binet.  It was there that you began seriously investigating child development.
Given your training and interest in natural science, you approached the problem of developmental psychology experimentally, testing the problem-solving skills of children of different ages. You concluded, after much observation, that the thinking structures of children differ from adults, and develop during different stages of the child's development.  That basic idea is core to all your theories of psychology.
You returned to Switzerland in 1921 as Director of the Rousseau Institute in Geneva. You married Valentie Châtenay in 1923, with whom you had three children: Jacqueline, Lucienne and Laurent.  
By carefully interviewing them (in a quasi-clinical setting) while they tried to solve problems you had set up, you developed your idea of 'genetic epistemology,' reflecting your emphasis on the origin of knowledge in development.  You theorize that the human mind has certain cognitive structures that correspond to different stages of development: sensorimotor, preoperational, concrete operational, and formal operational.  Contrary to the behaviorists, you do not believe that all learning is a matter of conditioning.  But at the same time, contrary to Descartes and the Port-Royalists, you don't believe it is innate either.  
According to you, children understands his or her world by adapting to new conditions and information using two basic ways: assimilation and accommodation.  'Assimilation' refers to the child's ability to fit current experiences into an existing conceptual structure, and 'accommodation' when the child has to create a new conceptual structure to understand new information. Understanding the psychology of a child, or a person, requires that we understand the cognitive structures he or she uses to understand his or her world.
Your view provides something of a counterpoint to the Freudian view of child development. While you both hold that the child psychology develops through a series of stages, you do not believe that the cognitive structures found in an adult would be found in a child.  It follows then that even if children engage in behaviors that adults would understand in a certain way (say, sexually), it does not mean that the child understands those behaviors in the same way. In fact, while you believe that psychoanalysis will not progress as a science until it unified its methodology to something more scientific (Freud never studied any actual children, for example), your main criticisms center around Freud's version of the genetic hypothesis. You share that criticism, of course, with Carl Jung.
Game Objectives
You are something of an independent on most of the issues that come before the APA.  At this point in your career, you are an old man, considered to be one of the greats in the history of psychology.  On the other hand, the first behaviorist revolution saw members of your generation as the enemy. You are sympathetic to those challenging behaviorism, including the cognitivists. But you're also deeply concerned about the scientific validity of psychoanalysis.
Your specific task in this game is to engage the new revolutionaries—Chomsky in particular—in a public discussion or debate of the concept of 'innateness' in psychology, and the acceptability of positing innate ideas in a scientific enterprise. You should propose the event to the conference committee in time for it to happen in 1975.
As you will remember, the problem of innate ideas strikes the very core of the idea of the scientific study of the mind: the empirical hypothesis unifies the tradition as a whole, with the exception of Jungians. Moreover, the debate on homosexuality often turns, in the public mind at the least, on whether sexuality is innate (an 'orientation') or not (a 'preference').  The kind of innateness you and Chomsky are discussing is probably not the same, as you both agree that the structure of thought that is innate, not the content. This should be made clear in your public discussion.
Chomsky posits that the there is a innate system of grammars that are common to all humans, as a function of our biology. You believe there is a 'fixed nucleaus' of cognition that is innate, but say that “the functioning of intelligence alone is hereditary.”  The actual debate is recorded in Piatelli-Palmarini's 1980 book, which you should review during the course of the game.
You are neutral on the issue of the definition of mental illness.

            <Text>Leona Tyler, PhD
Your Biography
You are Leona Tyler, Psychologist.
You were born in Chetek, Wisconsin in 1906. When you were a child, your family moved to Mesabi Iron Range in Minnesota, where you would live until college.
You originally studied English literature as an undergraduate. You met the applied psychologist D.G. Paterson and started a PhD In Psychology at the University of Minnesota.  In 1940, as ABD, you was appointed the head of the Personnel Research Bureau at the University of Oregon. After WWII, you established a veteran’s counseling service funded by the VA at U Oregon. In 1951-52, you traveled to Maudsley Hospital in England to work with the Psychiatrist Hans Eysenck. And in 1962-63, you held a Fulbright in Amsterdam.
In 1947, building on your experience at the University of Oregon, you published The Psychology of Human Differences. Still a classic of counseling, in it you suggest that the best way to understand individuals in counseling session is to see them as making choices between an infinite array of possible alternatives. You do not have a taste for theoretical bickering. As a counselor, you take a pragmatic approach to theoretical issues, but various commentators have noticed your similarity to theories of Piaget, Carl Rogers, Erik Erikson and others.  Your practice blends psychoanalytic, behavioral and cognitive therapies.
The primary focus of your work is 'individuality,' not in a philosophical or moral sense, but in the sense that you reject the idea that an individual personality can be represented as a profile of scores in an n-dimensional space. On the contrary, you argue that an individual personality can be best described by the series of choices that that individual has made. It is possible, you hypothesize, to identify patterns in choice-making behavior. Your 'Choice Pattern Technique,' which asks people to choose and sort cards representing careers and leisure-time activities, is still widely used by psychological and career counselors today.
In recent years, however, you have come to theorize that in order to make choices, an individual must be able to represent possible courses of actions or states of affairs that are not actual (i.e. possible but not currently real). At times, the internal representations discussed by these new 'Cognitive Scientists' like Chomsky and Miller, sound very similar to your hypothetical structures. But you're not willing to give up the obvious successes of behavioral therapy.
 To understand an individual, then, we must understand both that the individuals' cognitive / representational abilities and their patterns of choosing between possibilities to make them actual.
Game Objectives
As an initial member of the Research committee, you'll be called upon to judge the scientific legitimacy and ethical acceptability of proposed research programs.  You should make yourself familiar with the sections of the game book titled 'A Primer on Research Methods' and 'Ethics of Human Research'.  Your gamemaster will give you an additional sheet outlining the responsibilities of members of the research committee in evaluating proposals.
Notice that the official documents of the APA, as included in the game book, are written in gender-specific language: I.B states “a nonmember of the APA may read a paper provided that he is sponsored...”. The implication here is, of course, that a female nonmember is not allowed to present. As this document is an official representation of the policies of the APA, it should be clarified to reflect the policies of the organization. You should make those proposals in 1973.

If you become president, it is almost certain that there will be a number of proposed proclamations on the table.  You should insist on the following the 'advocacy' principle. If you can make it policy, so much the better:
As citizens, members of the APA have the right to advocate for any cause through the myriad of political advocacy organizations, but when psychologists and psychiatrists speak for the profession through APA public stances and proclamations, it should be from science and professional experience.

On occasion psychiatrists are asked for an opinion about an individual who is in the light of public attention or who has disclosed information about himself/herself through public media. In such circumstances, a psychiatrist may share with the public his or her expertise about psychiatric issues in general. However, it is unethical for a psychiatrist to offer a professional opinion unless he or she has conducted an examination and has been granted proper authorization for such a statement.
You can split these two paragraphs into two proposals, if you believe it will be easier to pass them. The second is a direct result of the Goldwater affair (see the gamebook 'Playing a psychologist or psychiatrist in the 1970s’), and anticipates the problems associated with the APA’s stand on abortion in 1970’s.  You can mine the history of both of these issues for arguments in favor of your proposal. You should also look at Principle 5 of the APA Ethical Standards of Psychologists for support.
You should organize your efforts on these manners with the other women in the organization. As you'll notice from the brief history in the gamebook, the APA had women members since its second year of existence, and Mary Whiton Calkins was a president in its 12th year (1905).  There has not, however, been a women in a leadership position since that time.  You are a serious candidate to be the first woman president in over 50 years.
You are neutral on the issue of the definition of mental illness, so long as it is clearly not gendered in any way.
Specific Assignments
You should present a paper introducing your view of counseling and a 'hopeful' psychology (based on your actual 1973 presidential address) whether or not you are elected president. If elected president, this should be your presidential address. If not, you'll have to propose it as a conference paper to the Program committee.

            <Comments>Many of the first-person stories on the 'treatments' of homosexuality that are collected at http://treatmentshomosexuality.org.uk/ come from Maudsley.
In 1964, a magazine called Fact asked 12,000 psychiatrists if they would be willing to diagnose conservative presidential candidate Barry Goldwater. Of the more than 2000 that responded 1,189 responded that he appeared to have a 'personality disorder'--that slippery category between psychosis and neurosis.  The headline proclaimed (under the magazine's title 'fact:') that “1,198 Psychiatrists Say Goldwater Is Psychologically Unfit To Be President! You may recall that the 1964 election witnessed Johnson's famous 'Daisy' ad, which suggested that the election of Barry Goldwater would lead to nuclear annihilation.⁠1  


1 For a brief history see Pinsker, H. (2007). “Goldwater Rule' History”, Psychiatric News, 42 (15), p. 33 (http://pn.psychiatryonline.org/content/42/15/33.1.full)
In 1969, the American Psychological Association issued a public proclamation, citing lack of evidence to the contrary that:
WHEREAS in many state legislature, bills have recently been introduced for the purpose of repealing or drastically modifying the existing criminal codes with respect to the termination of unwanted pregnancies; and whereas, termination of unwanted pregnancies is clearly a mental health and child welfare issue, and a legitimate concern of APA; be it resolved, that termination of pregnancy be considered a civil right of the pregnant woman, to be handled as other medical and surgical procedures in consultation with her physician, and to be considered legal if performed by a licensed physician in a licensed medical facility.⁠1

The American Psychiatric Association followed in 1977 with:
The emotional consequences of unwanted pregnancy on parents and their offspring may lead to long-standing life distress and disability, and the children of unwanted pregnancies are at high risk for abuse, neglect, mental illness, and deprivation of the quality of life. Pregnancy that results from undue coercion, rape, or incest creates even greater potential distress or disability in the child and the parents. The adolescent most vulnerable to early pregnancy is the product of adverse sociocultural conditions involving poverty, discrimination, and family disorganization, and statistics indicate that the resulting pregnancy is laden with medical complications which threaten the well-being of mother and fetus. The delivery that ensues from teenage pregnancy is prone to prematurity and major threats to the health of mother and child, and the resulting newborns have a higher percentage of birth defects, developmental difficulties, and a poorer life and health expectancy than the average for our society. Such children are often not released for adoption and thus get caught in the web of foster care and welfare systems, possibly entering lifetimes of dependency and costly social interventions. The tendency of this pattern to pass from generation to generation is very marked and thus serves to perpetuate a cycle of social and educational failure, mental and physical illness, and serious delinquency.
Because of these considerations, and in the interest of public welfare, the American Psychiatric Association
1)	opposes all constitutional amendments, legislation, and regulations curtailing family planning and abortion services to any segment of the population; 2) reaffirms its position that abortion is a medical procedure in which physicians should respect the patient's right to freedom of choice - psychiatrists may be called on as consultants to the patient or physician in those cases in which the patient or physician requests such consultation to expand mutual appreciation of motivation and consequences; and 3) affirms that the freedom to act to interrupt pregnancy must be considered a mental health imperative with major social and mental health implications.⁠2
You'll recall that the US Supreme court decided that abortion was covered by the constitutional dictate to a 'right to privacy,' thereby blocking all laws that had kept abortion illegal.

Your Biography
You were born July 3, 1917 in Rocky Ford, Colorado and obtained your B.S. from Harvard University in 1940, your Ph.D from Harvard University in 1947. You have worked in the Department of Anthropology at Indiana University from 1947 until the present, serving as the Director at the Institute for Sex Research starting 1956, after the death of your mentor, Alfred C. Kinsey.
You are an Anthropologist, not a psychologist.  Anthropology has a varied and checkered history, especially in relation to psychology and sociology.  All three of these fields purport to study the human mind and human organizations, but they have gone about it in very different ways.  The president of the APA in 1957, Lee J. Cronbach, titled his presidential address 'The Two Disciplines of Scientific Psychology.' Compare what Cronbach says about 'correlational' psychology to the method used by Kinsey.    
Game Objectives
Get on the Spitzer task force. You're an independent on all other issues that may come before the task force or the membership. It is important that you use your judgment on what an Anthropologist and sexologist would have thought of the various other proposals that come forward.
You are neutral on the definition of mental illness. 
Specific Assignments
Give a formal presentation of the findings of the Kinsey report in 1972, highlighting homosexuality in both mail and female.  I. Beiber's 1962 book Homosexuality: A Psychoanalytic Study is often seen as a response to the Kinsey report, so be prepared for significant questions from Socarides and Beiber.
Submit a proposal to have the APA formally recognize Evelyn Hooker for her Distinguished Contribution to Psychology in the Public Interest.
You are an initial member of the Program committee, with your term expiring in 1974. Review the model schedule in the gamebook, and solicit proposals from your peers. You are encouraged to add to the liminality of the game by decorating the room in themes corresponding to the different locations: 71: Washington DC, 72: Dallas, 73: Honolulu, 74: Philadelphia, 75: Chicago.

            <Text>Philip Zimbardo, PhD
Your Biography
You were born in 1933 and grew up in the South Bronx of New York City in a poor, uneducated Sicilian immigrant family. From your experience you learned that people, not material possessions, are our most valuable resource, that diversity should be embraced because it enriches us, and that education is the key to escaping poverty. Your education began in New York Public School 52 and later included Monroe High School (with classmate Stanley Milgram), Brooklyn College (published your first research article on race relations), and Yale University for your PhD (in 1959).
You started your teaching and research career at NYU, but moved to Stanford in 1968, and have remained there ever since.
Game Objectives
Propose a study to the research committee based on your infamous 1971 Prison experiment. Do not base your proposal on any of the stuff you find in popular culture, including that promoted and sold by Zimbardo himself.  Go back to the original paper (Haney, Banks &amp; Zimbardo 1973) and write the proposal based on that.
You are neutral on the issue of the definition of mental illness.
Specific Assignments
Write a paper, to be presented at the 1975 conference, on the ethical problems of the 1973 study – you may wish to watch the movie 'Quiet Rage' in preparation.  The Research committee will likely be tasked with revising the 1968 guidelines for ethical research in wake of your 1973 report. You should have concrete suggestions for those revisions.

            <Text>Evelyn Hooker, PhD
Your Biography
You are Evelyn Hooker, legend in the field of the psychology of human sexuality. In 1991, The APA  publicly recognizing you with an award for Distinguished Contribution in the Public Interest from the American Psychological Association. Your acceptance speech detailed your most famous study, and how it came to be. This is a rare case for a 'Reacting' character, so please excuse us as we quote it in length. It is far more detailed that we would ever be able to piece together from other sources.
When you received the APA’s award for Distinguished Contribution in the Public Interest in August 1992, you made a speech, which covered this part of the history of the APA.  A long excerpt from that speech is included here for your character development.  Do not quote or even paraphrase this speech in the course of the game - this is here are a primary source for you to understand your character’s biography and experiences during this period.

In 1953, when I applied for a six-month grant from the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) to study nonpatient, nonprisoner homosexuals, I had no intention of starting a new career. What I did not fully anticipate was the wealth of research demands and opportunities, the lively interest and cooperation of the gay community, and the continued interest and offers of assistance from the Grants Division of NIMH.
After I applied for the NIMH grant, the late John Eberhart came to UCLA to spend a day with me. It was clear that he wanted to see what and who I was. It was the height of the McCarthy era: Communists and homosexuals were the objects of destructive witch hunts. At the end of the day, Dr. Eberhard said "We are prepared to make you the grant, but you may not receive it. Everyone is being investigated. If you don't receive it, you won't know why and we won't know why."
I can only assume that either I was not investigated or that it was a slipshod investigation. In either case, why? My husband was a very distinguished professor of English at UCLA. In every way, he presented the characteristics of traditional values, but he fought very hard against the University of California loyalty oath, as had I. If the FBI had dug more deeply into my history, they would have found a first husband who drove an ambulance in the Spanish Civil War. If the question came to the FBI's attention at all, how did they interpret my interest in gay men? I will never know. If it was investigated, I did not know it.
Under the direction of Philip Sapir (who became chief of extramural grants when Dr. Eberhard left NIMH), I received a series of specific research grants until 1961, when I received a Research Career Award. During this time, Philip Sapir took a personal interest in my research, making the resources of his position available in incredible ways. For example, he invited me to give a lecture at NIMH especially for the research scientists, and afterward to spend three days in a seminar with a handpicked group of them. Because I worked alone, his moral, financial, and intellectual assistance became of the utmost importance. When I expressed my gratitude, he said that, in his position, he had general knowledge of many research projects and that it was very gratifying to know one in detail. It is highly probable that, without his interest and help, I would have stopped after the first major paper, and would not be here today.
The Role of Serendipity 	  	
As I reflect on the adverse conditions potentially threatening the successful pursuit of the goals of my research, I am impressed by the many serendipitous conditions that made the research possible. For example, a site visitor stressed the "fact" that members of the study committee would consider that I was working with psychopathology and that I must have a psychiatric consultant. With many reservations, I went to see the chair of the Psychiatry Department. When he asked about the research, I told him I was studying "normal male homosexuals." He rose from his chair and said, "What do you think you are doing? There is no such person." He then referred me to Frederic Worden, who had just come to the department. I let Dr. Worden read my application. He, then, turned to me and said, "I have never seen such persons, but I sure would like to." He became a valuable consultant.
A second perennially recurring situation was the demand of university officials that the research be conducted at the university. I resisted this demand because to have yielded would have meant the end. Not a single person would have come. The first absolute condition was secrecy and confidentiality. By great good fortune, our home was a very spacious estate of an acre of ground with a garden study separate from the house. It was there that the research was conducted. Once a person opened the garden gate, he was invisible to the neighbors. Without this superb place in which to conduct the research, I would never have attempted it.
The Imperative of Confidentiality
It will be obvious to you that the absolute sine qua non of research into behavior thought to be "a sin, a crime, and a disease" is confidentiality. Before I began the research, my friend Christopher Isherwood lived in the study for a while. If I asked him for a favor, he would often reply, "Yes, if you will keep me out of Norwalk." Norwalk is a California mental institution. The triple stigma was never far from the minds of the men whom I came to know nor was it far from mine.
The ramifications of confidentiality in this project were very extensive. A young gay man recently asked, "How did they know they could trust you?" The answer is, I don't know. Every testing and life history session was tape recorded. I assured each person that only my secretary would listen to them and after transcribing them would erase the tapes. Did they believe me? Yes, apparently so. One man who was nationally known by his books called me long distance at frequent intervals to ask whether his tapes had been erased.
One of my objectives was to understand each life as fully as possible, and thus to keep all of the personally identifying data for each man. This meant, in my view, that it would be impossible to share this highly confidential material with a co-worker. Building confidentiality with the gay community at that time was not an easy task. I could not lightly, if at all, share these confidences with another. Informal applications to be a coinvestigator were numerous, but I continued to work alone until the data gathering phase was complete.
Working alone in such a stress- and trauma-laden field inevitably entails high psychological costs. Without a colleague with whom to share the sympathetic knowledge of human suffering, sometimes one's own vicarious suffering becomes almost unbearable. This was especially true for me after my husband's death. I hasten to make clear that, when I characterize conducting research with gay men as stressful, I am only referring to the McCarthy era when the penalties were barbaric.
Even then, had I chosen just to remain in my study and let the gay men come to me, perhaps the stress would have been less. I could not settle for less. Instead, I accepted invitations to gay parties, gay organizations, gay after-hours clubs, and gay bars. I was convinced that, because of the secrecy imposed on gay men whose occupations and very lives were at risk if their identity became known, it was essential to know and understand everything I could about the gay social milieu that they created.
How it came to be known as the "gay world" remains a mystery to me. As I know it, however, the term in its generic meaning is, in part, justified. Camping, for example, is a dramatic form of behavior in both its high and low comic and tragic aspects. Perhaps an illustration will convey something of both. One evening at a dinner party attended by a number of distinguished writers and myself as the only woman, attention turned to how the guests could enhance my knowledge of gay institutions, for example, gay baths. My friend, Christopher Isherwood, then began a very dramatic story about how he would take me to the Crystal Baths on the Santa Monica beach, and what we would see, beginning on Level 1 – nude men in various sexual activities – complete with hilarious descriptions of the activities on each of the various levels until we reached the top. And then, he said, I would be killed, because no woman is allowed to know the secrets of the gay world and live.
The issue of confidentiality became acute in what I shall refer to later as "the Year of the Trial." Meanwhile, my adversarial position vis-a-vis the Los Angeles police force needs some clarification. I was pressured by a psychiatrist friend to seek an appointment with the chief of police. My friend said, "Of course he knows about your research activities and it would be helpful if he met you in person." How would the chief of police know about my research activities? In an invited paper entitled "The Gay Community," given in Copenhagen in 1961, I have described my research activities in gay bars. The police would have been aware of these activities, in part because I was usually the only woman in a bar. I hasten to add that I always went to a gay bar with a gay friend.
I was advised by my psychiatrist friend not to go alone for the appointment with the chief. Why? Because I was a woman. Dr. Worden accompanied me, biting his nails and saying that he had watched too many police films. Chief Parker did not understand why I was doing the research, "because a man from Pasadena proved it was all glandular." When I objected, he said "Well, it's like the smog. It doesn't matter how it got here. We just have to deal with it." He then wanted to introduce me to the Central Vice detail. I avoided that because I knew that if I did, the news would be all over the gay community within hours. I asked whether the police would ever try to subpoena my confidential files. "No," he replied, "If you should ever have information about a homosexual murder, I hope you would voluntarily give us the information."
I turn now to the Year of the Trial, 1961. Briefly, the facts are that five people were arrested and charged with conspiracy to obtain a criminal abortion. The five were two psychiatrists, an obstetrician, a young man, and myself. I had referred the young man (a friend) and his girlfriend to one psychiatrist, who had recommended a therapeutic abortion and who had sent the pair to a second psychiatrist, who made the same recommendation and sent them to an obstetrician. He performed the surgery in his office without a nurse present and sent the woman home. Complications developed. Her boyfriend insisted on hospitalization. Her father moved her to another hospital and declared charges to the police.
When two men, identifying themselves as with the state board of quality assurance visited me in my university office, I became alarmed when they asked "On what do you do research?" and "Do you accept fees for referrals?" It did not occur to me that I was personally in danger. However, waves of anxiety swept over me as I thought about the perils to my research data riddled with identifying names, places, and dates. I knew, as did many, of the unscrupulous surveillance practices of the Los Angeles Police Department at that time. My secretary and I spent the better part of the year in removing identifying data from the records. A judge, six months after the grand jury indictment, ruled that the jury had insufficient grounds to indict me. The anxiety did not diminish until both psychiatrists and the young man were declared innocent. Many of my friends believe that the police acted in my case only because of my research on homosexuality. It cannot be proved, but I believe it is so.
Incidentally, I carried a letter signed by the Chancellor at UCLA which identified me in case my activities were ever brought to the attention of law enforcement authorities. I never needed it, and felt I never would unless the university was involved.
The NIMH Task Force 	  	
In 1969, I was called by Stanley Yolles, then director of NIMH, asking me to come to Washington and "tell him what we ought to be doing about homosexuality." He added that "we want to sweep it out from beneath the rug." I suggested that we needed a group of thoughtful people who were social scientists or were in law, religion, or psychiatry and who could bring their knowledge to bear on this question. The director replied that if I would give him a list, he would make the appointments for a "blue ribbon task force." I looked forward to it with high expectations.
The agenda that I proposed was both a comprehensive outline of research and of social policy issues, including the possible endorsement of a model penal code and the establishment at NIMH of a center for the study of sexuality. Many members of the task force said at the outset that they knew nothing about homosexuality. I thought that should not exclude them because they were needed to bring social science to bear on the issues. The discussions were lively and gave promise of a good final report, with two exceptions.
The stumbling blocks were viewing homosexuality as not necessarily synonymous with psychopathology, and endorsing a model penal code in which homosexuality was no longer viewed as a crime. Thus, three task force members wrote dissenting opinions on the basis that (a) NIMH was not a policymaking, but solely a research institution, and (b) that there were not enough data to support the "normal" position. Within three years, however, the American Psychiatric Association voted to delete homosexuality from its diagnostic handbook, and the American Psychological Association (APA) followed.
Our task force report was not published for two years, an indication of what some officials thought of it. Judd Marmor, a distinguished and indispensable member of the task force, when asked why we did not accomplish more, said that one possible reason might be that I was too optimistic. That may be true. After all, in 1963, Dr. Marmor asked me to write a chapter for his first book on homosexuality, titled Inversion. He said that I must write it, "because you are the only person to hold your point of view."
Highlights and Satisfactions 	  	
I have spoken of some of the problems related to my research in the repressive milieu of the 1950s and I 960s. I would like now to mention some highlights of my satisfaction and delight.
First, can you imagine what it was like when I examined the results of the three judges of the adjustment ratings from the projective techniques? I knew the men for whom the ratings were made, and I was certain as a clinician that they were relatively free of psychopathology. But what would these superb clinicians find? You know now that the two groups, homosexuals and heterosexuals, did not differ in adjustment of psychopathology. When I saw that, I wept with joy. I knew that the psychiatrists would not accept it then. But sometime!
[cut, for the purposes of the game]
Another, earlier event was back in 1961, when I was invited to give a paper at the International Congress of Psychology. I learned that a young Norwegian, Finn Carling, was beginning a study of homosexuals and that it would be worth my while to see him. When I called him, he said that he was just beginning and that it would not be worth my while. I persisted, and he agreed to meet me at the airport. "You will know me because I have a big dog," he said. And so he did. Friends told me he was a spastic. Don't ask me how he drove his car, because he had the use of two forefingers only. He said, "If you don't mind not talking about science for awhile, I will show you where I grew up." He pointed to a stream running through a meadow where his parents had put him, having been told he would never walk. But he did – at 15.
After we had tea, he turned to me and said, "I want you to know that I am on their side." I think I said, "Me too." And then he said an astonishing thing: "I am not only studying homosexuals, but I am studying refugees, because they teach me the meaning of movement. I am studying the blind, because they will teach me the meaning of sight, of vision. I am studying homosexuals, because they will teach me the meaning of love.
That was 30 years ago, but Finn Carling's radiant face, his enormous physical and psychological courage, and what he wanted to learn from gay and lesbian folk have never faded in intensity. In an age when the scourge of AIDS continues relentlessly, there are many images of love in the gay world. I have the conviction that without love, the gay world would perish.
In the summer of 1937, at the height of the Spanish Civil War, I was in London. I attended a Spanish Republican rally. It was at fever pitch, so to speak, and the crowd was demanding that Paul Robeson, that great man and great voice, sing the Spanish National Anthem. From time to time, he would say "I'm saving the best to the last." Finally, with sounds that seemed to come from the bowels of the earth, he sang the Spanish National Anthem.
I have one more event to note, and I have saved the most extraordinary to the Last. About four years ago, I received a letter from a trustee officer at a bank in Lincoln, Nebraska. In it he stated that Wayne Placek had designated me to select a committee to decide how the trust fund he was establishing should distribute funds for the purpose of research to increase "the general public's understanding of gay men and lesbians, and reduce the stress experienced by those people in this and future civilizations." I remember that I had interviewed Wayne Placek in the late 1950s, but nothing unusual came to mind. I did remember that, along with many others, he hated being gay because of society's treatment.
After a period of three years, the final settlement of the fund was announced – approximately a half million dollars! Through the valiant and imaginative work of Steve Morin and Douglas Kimmel, the money now is in the American Psychological Foundation, earmarked for research under the control of Dr. Morin and selected officers of Division 44, and the guidance of the Foundation.

Game Objectives
You were trained as a behaviorist, by Karl Muenzinger and Robert Yerkes, who was a good friend of John Watson. Many of Watson's arguments draw from comparative psychology as a discipline. Muensinger's view, however, was more like Tolman's than Yerkes (see the “History of Definitions of 'Psychology'” in the gamebook). You are committed—as is your field—to the thesis that one can learn about the psychology of humans by studying the minds of animals. If the cognitivists are successful at getting the line between “man and brutes” reestablished, it may relegate your field to a psychological footnote.  Defend behaviorism, in particular the thesis that there is no hard and fast line between humans and animals, from the attacks of the cognitivitsts.

You published a pivotal study on homosexuality in 1956 and 1957 that along with Kinsey's report, is usually credited with starting the movement to remove homosexuality from the DSM.  Look up the study and read it carefully. You'll be expected to speak about its findings during the 1971 conference.  You should also understand your opponent's position on this matter.
Freud mentions homosexuality a number of places in Introductory Lectures on Psychoanalysis, and it is crucially important that you study these carefully.  Freud believes that sexual life of children, which is regarded at the time as 'normal' includes a number of activities that would later in life be viewed as 'perverse', including same-sex contact.  In Freud's theory, heterosexuality develops with puberty in normal people. In 'inverts' or homosexuals, something goes wrong in this development. The object of ones' 'natural' desire--the genitals of the opposite sex—becomes transformed into parts of the body that represent those parts in the same sex.  Thus, homosexuality is no different in psychological mechanism than a foot fetish or any other neurotic 'perversion' (see p. 376-384 of Introductory Lectures) Homosexuality is not a psychologically isolated condition. According to Freud:
“We are compelled, however, to regard the choice of an object of one's own sex as a divergence in erotic life which is of positively habitual occurrence, and we are learning more and more to ascribe an especially high importance to it.” (p. 381)
In short, homosexuality is a kind of neurosis, yet it is not, itself, particularly worrying. The action itself is merely 'habitual,' and hence can be cured through standard habit-blocking therapy (Freud suggests that paranoia stops homosexuality on p. 381 of the Introductory Lectures).  It is, however, invariably an indicator of deeper psychological problems, as the transference and substitution of the 'natural' object of sexual desire to a different object will cause neurosis. See Ch 26 of the Introductory Lectures, especially p. 530, for Freud's explanation of homosexuality as neurotic narcissism.
Your study, which sought to establish if homosexuals exhibited neurotic symptoms aside from their homosexuality, is a direct challenge to Freud's theory.  The current advocates of the Freudian tradition in Homosexuality are C. Socarides and I. Bieber.  Bieber's 1962 book Homosexuality presented the result of his 9-year study of 100 homosexual males. According to him, homosexuals males are those whose 'heterosexual instinct' is crippled in some way. Be ready to defend your study against criticisms from Socarides and Bieber.
When, and if, the game reaches a point of trying to define mental illness, you must pass a behaviorist interpretation of mental disorder / illness.
Specific Assignments
You are an initial member of the program committee, with your term expiring in 1972. That means it is your responsibility to coordinate with the other two members (Gebhard and Anastasi) to arrange the conference schedule for the second week of class. After that, consider running for the Board of Directors or President of the APA. 71: Washington DC, 72: Dallas.
In 1971, you are scheduled to give a talk entitled “The mental health of non-patient male homosexuals” during the panel session titled “ Psychiatry: Friend or Foe to Homosexuals: A Dialogue” with John Fryer. This talk should introduce the history of your research, and the data you have that shows that non-patient homosexuals are not mentally disordered. You might also make reference to the 1964 ‘Midtown Manhatten Study’ (1964), which seems to show that mental health disturbances are more related to social-economic status than any other factor—in this case, it may be consistent with your findings that any perceived mental illness is gay men is the result of their ostracism from society, rather than the cause thereof. 
In 1972, there will probably be competing papers from Socrides &amp; Bieber and Richard Green. Both of these papers will likely contain critiques or analyzes of your data. Be prepared to defend your study, or use it to critique others.
In 1973, oppose the dissolution of the nomenclature committee on grounds that the proposed taskforce would give too much power to a single individual: Spitzer.  The process of classifying mental illness needs to be open and transparent, and an elected committee would be more open and transparent than a taskforce.

You were born in 1920 in Charleston, West Virginia, where you lived until you enrolled in George Washington University in 1937. You transferred to the University of Alabama in 1938, where you completed your BA and were appointed Instructor of Psychology in 1941. You started Graduate school at Harvard in 1943.
While at Harvard, you joined the Psycho-Acoustical Laboratory where you worked on speech communication over static on radios.  At that time you met and befriended a brilliant young linguist named Noam Chomsky.
You were elected to the position of Vice President of the APA in 1970, and take the role of President for the meeting of the APA in 1971, the first year of game play. You were 50 at the time of your election, which is young by professional standards.
You made your research ‘name’ with your famous paper “The magic number seven plus or minus two” (Miller, 1956). It is a must-read for all psychologists today. In 1960, you published Plans and the structure of behavior, which sets out your vision of psychology as a cognitive science (Miller, 1960). In fact, you founded the Center for Cognitive Studies at Harvard in 1960.
You are also a student of the history of Psychology. In 1958, you were approached by the historian of Psychology E.G. Boring, whose tomes A History of Experimental Psychology and Sensation and Perception in the History of Experimental Psychology adorn the desks of many psychologists and philosophers. You were brought to the project by Boring himself, who had been scheduled to produce an update to his histories, but was unable to do so. At the time, you had been planning a new set of introductory psych courses at Harvard at the time, so you thought that this might be an opportunity for sympathetic research.
You took a leave of absence for the academic year 1958-1959 and spent the time at the Center for Advanced Study in Behavioral Sciences at Stanford. When you returned to Harvard, you worked with your colleague Jerome S. Bruner to create an introductory course titled “Psychological Conceptions of Man.” By 1961, you had finished the book which was published as Psychology: The Science of Mentality (Miller, 1962).
Game Objectives
Promote your vision of cognitive psychology as an alternative to behaviorism. You should actively work to funnel funding to projects that attempt to make inferences about underlying mental mechanisms, and away from those that deny the existence of such mechanisms (i.e. radical behaviorists).
As a student of the history of psychology, you are also very keen to place yourself in the narrative arc of psychology –which means that you will keep a close eye on those who are characterizing historical figures in inaccurate ways, or ignoring historical achievements that are often forgotten. Both the behaviorists and the psychoanalysts have a tendency to dismiss aspects of the history of psychology as 'non-scientific.' You are not so sure.
There is much in the work done by early experimentalists like William James that anticipates your work. And while you're wary of being labeled an 'introspectivist' and dismissed as a neo-Wundtian, it is important to point out that cognitivism has historical antecedents, and it may be behaviorism that is the historical anomaly. Watson and Pavlov are clearly important psychologists, but the history of psychology has not always been behavioristic, and you are keen to ensure that it is not portrayed as such.

You are neutral on the issue of the definition of mental illness, but be ready to oppose any definition that is clearly behaviorist or psychoanalytic in nature.
Game Strategy
Your position as first president gives you great power, but also great responsibility. Your first speech sets the tone of the entire game, not just the first session. So while there will be a great temptation to spend your time beating up behaviorism and promoting cognitivism, you should work hard to reconcile the warring factions.  You are the first president from the cognitivist side – the behaviorists are worried that your election signifies a massive shift in the kind of research that will be valued and funded.  You need to allay those worries, and work for understanding of the mind, not petty disciplinary politics.
Much can be done towards this end by maintaining a good, highly visible working relationship with your elected successor Anthony Bandura.  Remember that like him, you were ‘raised’ a behaviorist. The people in that faction are your friends and colleagues. What’s more, some commentators have pointed out that Bandura’s theory of ‘social learning’ in the bobo doll experiment can be interpreted to support a cognitivist position, rather than a behaviorist one. If you changed your mind, perhaps Bandura can as well? The same holds for Evelyn Hooker, who was schooled in the 'Tolman' tradition of behaviorism.
Specific Assignments
You chair the Board of Directors during the first APA.
You will open the game with a presidential address based on George Miller's actual speech “Psychology as a means of promoting human welfare.”
Look up Miller’s actual presidential speech (Miller, 1969). You’ll notice that it is actually not about the conflict between behaviorism and cognitivism. It is about what the psychological community can agree upon, not about what you disagree. Take a cue from the actual history here, and follow in his lead.
In the first week, the gamemaster will introduce a 'mental rotation' experiment based in Shepard &amp; Metzler 1971. You should be prepared to present the data – if your class is using the online psychology laboratory, report your classes' data. If not, report the data from the original.
Advocate for the role of psychology in social issues, supporting both Chomsky and others in their efforts.
When Bieber and Socarides submit their report on sexual deviation in 1972, you should reject it as assuming too strict a Freudian perspective.
Fission: Found the Cognitive Science Society with Noam Chomsky and David Marr (if he is a character).

            <Title>RGold</Title>
            <Text>Ron Gold, Journalist
Your Biography
You were born in Brooklyn in 1930 and entered Brooklyn College at fifteen. It  took you twelve years to get a degree. By that time, you had been a junkie in San Francisco.
The actual Ron Gold has told his story as a part of a theater production called 'Queer Stories' in New York.  The total story is available online (see 'Must Read' section), but I'll excerpt the early part here:
When I was 13 I told my sister I thought I really liked boys, and it was right after that I saw my first psychiatrist. He shot me full of sodium pentothal, and all I really remember about him are his big, round, thick glasses on his big, white, moon face, very, very close to my face. I was scared out of my wits.
The next one was when I was 15. I'd just entered college, and I wanted to move out of my parents' apartment — which they thought required medical attention. This pleasantly rumpled psychiatrist gave me his diagnosis: homosexuality. He told me I should get away from my mother. I was grateful for that, and three years later I got him to write a note for me to the draft board.
The draft board psychiatrist asked me, "where do you cruise?" I told him, but he still didn't seem convinced I wasn't putting on an act, until he saw the book I was carrying. "T.S. Eliot!" he said, and checked off the fag box on his form.
At 19 I went to school at Berkeley, California and soon I was having a thing with an ex-convict named Frank and Eddie (he told some people his name was Frank and some people his name was Eddie). Anyway, it wasn't going very well, so I went to the university counseling department and got this psychiatrist who didn't seem much older than I was. He kept his watch on his desk facing HIM, and once I asked him what time it was. He wouldn't tell me. He wanted to know the REAL reason I'd asked the time.
So I quit him, quit Frank and Eddie, quit school, moved to San Francisco and became a junkie. After I got busted, I moved back to New York, lived with my parents, worked for my father and spent my entire paycheck every week on junk. Except one week, age 24, I decided to do what my friend Carl Solomon had done, pound on the door of Psychiatric Institute, demanding instant entry. Except they didn't take junkies. And I had missed my weekly connection and was getting sick. So I gave all my money to somebody I didn't know — who never showed up with the dope — and I walked from the Bronx to midtown for a matinee of "Wonderful Town."
I was really sick by intermission, so my sister took me to a doctor — and ANOTHER psychiatrist, who shipped me off to the Menninger Clinic. So I was in Topeka, Kansas for five years, and I can actually say I got something out of it. I had a nice place to be locked up in for a while (so I couldn't get to the junk); I finished college; went to work; joined the Topeka Civic Theatre; learned to play bridge — and learned that there were plenty of people, including psychiatrists, who were just as crazy as I was, and doing more or less okay.
And, when I got back to New York, at age 29, I found it wasn’t true that I hadn’t solved my biggest psychological problem. I found a lover; and right away I began to see that MY HOMOSEXUALITY WASN’T A PROBLEM: that homosexuality isn’t a problem. So ten years later I was ready for Stonewall. And my next encounter with psychiatry, at 41, was as the leader of a zap by the Gay Activists Alliance, at the behaviorists convention. You remember the behaviorists: they’re the ones who show you pictures of gorgeous naked men (or women, if you’re a lesbian) and then they give you an electric shock.
So we took over one of their sessions and there I met Dr. Robert Spitzer, who turned out to me a member of the American Psychiatric Association committee (news of which I leaked to the New York Times), and he got us a major panel discussion at the 1972 APA convention in Hawaii.
[Note: the events of the 'Zap' are described in the gamebook, as well as Gold's encounter 'taking over one of their sessions' and meeting Spitzer at the New York talk by Socarides.  Gold is slightly wrong here: the APA convention in Hawaii was 1973. And Socarides, who's talk the GAA took over, was a psychoanalyst, not a behaviorist. He did, however, probably use aversion-based shock therapy.]
Spitzer recounts the interaction as:
“I went to this conerence on behavioral modification which the gay lib. group broke up. I found myself talking to a very angry young man. At that time I was convinced that homosexuality was a disorder and that it belonged in the classification, I told him so.”
Gold says (in Gold, R. “Three Stories of Gay Liberation” ) “[Spitzer] said he believed in the illness theory. I said, alright, who do you believe? And he hadn't ready any of it... But he happened to know Socarides and thought he was a nut.  Whom do you believe? Bieber? I don't know. Have you read it? No. But they all believed it.”
After a career writing for various publications, including Variety, you became a full-time gay activist at the age of forty-one. You were one of the founders of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force. You were also the Media director for the Gay Activists Alliance during the early l970's.
Game Objectives
Work with Frank Kameny / Barbara Gittings (if they are in the game) to convince the APA to remove 'homosexuality' from the DSM.  
You're interaction with Spitzer after the Socarides talk is not 'played' in the game, but is part of the background included in the gamebook. That means you already have a relationship with Spitzer. Use this to convince him that homosexuality itself doesn't make people anxious or mentally unstable, classifying homosexuals as mentally ill makes them anxious or mentally unstable.  You have a great deal of data to pull from in making your case: Kinsey made a similar argument, and Hooker's data showed that homosexuals, outside of the context of psychiatric institutionalization, were indistinguishable from heterosexuals on standard psychological tests.
As a non-member of the APA, you cannot vote on the definition of mental illness. But be sure to advocate for one that does not penalize or marginalize those with harmless social differences.
Specific Assignments
Work with Marmor to draft a proposal to remove 'homosexuality' (302.0) from the DSM-II in 1971.
Sit on the symposium on the declassification in 1973. Your paper title should be “Stop It, You’re Making Me Sick!,” and you will argue that “their sickness label provided the biggest rationale for our oppressors, and was the CAUSE of homosexual’s self-hate, not the solution.”
Invite Spitzer to a secret meeting of the GayPA in 1973. Advise him to be 'undercover' and just observe the large number of psychiatrists who are members. Legend has it that at that meeting, a young navy psychiatrist broke down in tears upon seeing Spitzer in attendance, overcome with the anxiety that his sexual orientation would lead to the loss of his job.  It was at that moment that Spitzer became convinced that your argument was correct: that the classification of homosexuality as a mental illness was doing more harm to homosexuals than good. Again, legend has it that you and he draft the language to remove homosexuality that night.
There are a few problems with the legendary story.  First, the 1st person accounts vary in their details: the actual Ron Gold sets the events in 1972, but that's impossible, as the APA met in Dallas in 1972 and Honolulu in 1973.  Second, I'm not convinced that the 'conversion' experience does adequate justice to the many others involved in the movement, including Judd Marmor and John Spiegel. The student playing Spitzer is aware of these inconsistencies, but has not been instructed to play it one way or the other. It will be up to you and him or her to determine how the proposal of 1973 is created.

SECRET: you were a patient of Charles Socarides.  You're familiar with the kind of reasoning that a psychotherapist can trap you in, if they are willing.   [Game Note: this is a conflation for the purposes of the game – Gold had been ‘treated’ for homosexuality by a psychoanalyst as a adolescent, but not by Socarides]

            <Title>HHarlow-bio</Title>
            <Text>Harry Harlow, PhD
Your Biography
You are Harry Frederick Harlow. You were born in Iowa, but began your academic career at Reed College in Portland, OR. You were one of four boys in tightly-nit extended family.  You transferred to Stanford in 1923, where you stayed until you finished your Ph.D  under the supervision of C.P. Stone in 1930. Your dissertation work was on rat behavior, which soured you forever on rat research. During this time, you became keenly interested in the history of psychology- a side passion you share with George Miller.
Your first job after graduate school was at the University of Wisconsin, where you still teach. Your introductory class is something of  legend on campus, where you are renowned for your wit and gentle teasing of students.
In 1949, you were appointed the chief psychologist of the US Army, a post that you held until 1951. During that time, you were tasked with creating guidelines for the army's use of psychological research methods. Your work lead to the establishment of the Human Resources Research Office (HumRRO), which still exists today.
Shortly after your arrival at Wisconsin, you met an brilliant young psychology student named Clara Mears, who suggested that the Madison Zoo might be able to provide monkeys for research—which were far more interesting than rats. This little suggestion ended not only in your establishing the primate research lab, which later combined with the Wisconsin Regional Primate Lab in 1964, but also in your marriage to Clara.  She sacrificed her degree in psychology for your marriage, as the University would not allow a husband to oversee a wife's dissertation. You were married to Clara for 13 years, at which point you were divorced and quickly remarried to a colleague in the department at Wisconscin. Clara remarried as well.
You originally intended to study the central nervous system of the rhesus monkeys, but found that there were no standardized measures that could be used to gage their perceptual and learning systems.  In developing those measures, you discovered a great deal about primate learning systems—far, far more than you probably ever would have about the central nervous system. In your terms, you discovered the 'learning set'—a predisposition to learn according to a set process.
Faced with a simple perceptual discrimination problem monkeys initially started with the traditional trial-and-error method. But at some point, they seemed to catch onto a general principle that would allow them to skip over much of that tedious work. Ultimately, you theorize, they begin to display “insight,” which allows one-trial learning. This arc of development contrasts with the traditional behaviorist approach associated with Clark Hull and the 'Yale' school of behaviorism. During much of the 1940s and into the 1950s, you were engaged in a long confrontation with that school of thought.  By the end, however, you emerged 'victorious,' having forced psychology to admit rule-governed abstraction and “insight.”
Today, you are most famous for your theories on 'love' – specifically those that relate to your experiments with baby rhesus monkey's attachment to their mothers.
Your research in this area started as a lucky accident.  You wanted to start a self-sustaining breeding colony of monkeys, but the first generation, who had been caught in the wild, were diseased. When babies were born, you immediately separated them from their mothers and reared them in a sterile environment. You found, however, that while the babies developed physically, they were emotionally disturbed. As adults, for example, they would not mate. One day, you observed that the babies clung to the soft blankets that were in their environment, and even seemed to stroke their diapers. This observation inspired your most famous experiment:
After separating baby rhesus monkeys from their mothers, you provided them with either soft, 'cuddly' surrogate 'mothers' or wire 'mothers'.  The babies preferred the soft, cuddly mothers even when food was supplied entirely by the wire mothers.  When babies were allowed access only to the wire mothers, they developed abnormally.
Importance of contact as basic human drive, expanding Hull's theory.
During the 1960s, you continued to research love – distinguishing five kinds of love: maternal love for the child, infant love for the mother, age-mate or peer love, adult heterosexual love, and paternal love for the child. You believe that infant love for the mother was a necessary precursor for age-mate or peer love, and both were required for adult heterosexual love. Rhesus monkey infant raised for six months in isolation showed an inability to engage in normal adult love-relationships, and they exhibited behaviors associated with schizophrenics and autistics: such s self-rocking and huddling. You further found that 'therapy' could help cure these isolated monkeys, but only if the 'therapist' monkey who was used to reestablish physical contact with the 'patient' monkey was at the age of starting his own peer relationships and was much younger and less aggressive than the 'patient.'
Game Objectives
You were president of the APA in 1970, so you no longer can run for president. But you certainly can serve on various committees. Your research on monkeys makes you keenly aware of issues in the ethics of experimentation, so the ethics committee is a good choice.  You are also a student of history of psychology and passionate about research design, so the grants committee might be a good choice. Your main goal in the game should be to encourage experiments that will continue the development of behaviorism and block any movements made by the cognitivists to redefine the nature of psychology as anything other than the study of observable behavior.
Submit a proposal to give a talk in 1972 on your research on the development of heterosexual relationships in the rhesus monkey, experimental inventions that you've shown corrupt the normal development, and the therapeutic interventions that may correct that corruption, and how that relates to Freud's theory of psycho-sexual development (you'll need Harlow 1975).
Defend the use of behavioral techniques – especially aversion therapy – in treating patients.  In 1974, there will probably be a proposal to deem it immoral. You don't necessarily want to defend the treatment of homosexuality per se, but just to make sure that behavioristic treatment isn't restricted because of some blanket statements.
DSM-III: You support the theoretically-neutral and evidence-based approach to taxonomy advocated by Spitzer, but are keen to make sure that behaviorist therapies such as 'aversion therapies' are not ruled out by the classification.
When, and if, the game reaches a point of trying to define mental illness, you must pass a behaviorist interpretation of mental disorder / illness.
Fission: split to the Society for the Experimental Analysis of Behavior.

            <Text>Stanley Milgram, PhD
Your Biography
You are Stanley Milgram, social psychologist. You were born August 15, 1933 to a family of  Jewish immigrants from Germany who had settled in the Bronx and opened a bakery. By all accounts, you had a warm and untroubled childhood.
Your intelligence was spotted early in life and encouraged by your parents. In one legendary event, your experiments with your chemistry set brought the local fire department. You are most famous for your 'obedience' experiments starting in 1961 at Yale. These experiments sought to understand how normal people could do horrible things to others in the presence of an authority figure. Many people have drawn parallels between your experiments and the behavior of Nazi soldiers in the Holocaust, or even the actions of academics during the McCarthy era in the US. One biographer (Blass, 2004) has noted that your Bar Mitzvah speech was on the plight on European Jews under Hitler, and the McCarthy purges at Queens College occurred when you were enrolled.
After completing your undergraduate study in 1954, you applied to Harvard's Department of Social Relations, an interdisciplinary program that included social psychology, sociology, anthropology and clinical psychology. You were rejected.  You persisted, however, taking summer classes in psychology. Eventually, they let you in provisionally. You were admitted to the full program after a year.
There you worked with Solomon Asch, who was investigating conformity to group thinking by testing whether a subject would give the wrong answer to a question if it agreed with the group of experimental confederates.  For your dissertation, you extended this research by comparing Norwegians and French.
You moved to Yale in 1960, where you began designing your famous experiment. You submitted proposals to the National Science Foundation (NSF), the National Institutes of Mental Health (NIMH) and the Office of Naval Research.
You moved back to Harvard to direct the Department of Social Relations in 1963, but left for CUNY in 1966. You famous 'obedience' studies were conducted while you were at Yale. They have been the subject of great controversy, both from a scientific and ethical perspective.  As a student, make sure you are confident in the experimental protocol as well as the results. See Milgram 1963 and 1965 for the primary source report.
You now chair the graduate program in social psychology at CUNY.
In 1967, you published the famous 'small world' study, in which you randomly selected individuals in Omaha, Nebraska and Wichita, Kansas, and asked them to try to deliver a packet of information to a target person in Boston, Mass. If they did not know the target personally, they should give the letter to someone who might be able to pass it on.  Milgram then counted the number of contacts handled the packet in transit – the average was 5.5, giving us the common myth of 'six degrees of separation.'  
Game Objectives
Get onto the research committee. While you have always had an interest in research ethics, the criticism of your experiments have made you develop something of an expertise in the APA standards (that means, of course, that you, as the student, need to develop an expertise with both Milgram's experimental design and the APA standards that are included in the gamebook).
You are neutral on the issue of the definition of mental illness.
Specific Assignments
If your class is larger than 16, you'll start as board-member-at-large for 1971.
Propose an experiment on campus testing the 'small world' problem in the campus environment in 1974.  Present your results (or, if the experiment is not completed in time, or denied by the research committee, the results of Milgram's original 1967 experiment) to the conference.
Oppose the proposal (from Clark, 1975) to create an affirmative action plan for psychology and psychiatry, on the grounds that it is an unwarranted authoritarian intervention in personal matters.  Milgram is quoted in Blass, 2004 (p. 201) as saying (in 1971):
 “There is some sense of progress and movement at the Graduate Center. A big question, however, is whether intellectual standards or political pressures will prevail in the conduct of our program. Already, we have been asked to recruit faculty on a racial basis, and we make exceptions to our usual admission standards in assessing potential black students. If carried too far, this could have disastrous consequences for the quality of the program. Then I'll leave.”
Present a paper summarizing your study of obedience (1963 and 1965) also in 1974, to complement the symposium on the social responsibility of academics.

            <Title>PsychoanalysisOverview</Title>
            <Text>Psychoanalyst Overview
The central issue in this game—whether it be voiced in the selection of experiments to be run via the grants committee or in the classification of mental illness in the nomenclature committee—is the the nature of the scientific investigation of the human mind. For the psychoanalysts, as opposed to the behaviorists, the science of the mind is not about predicting and controlling behavior. It is about discovering the true things about our minds.  Thus, a treatment or theory is judged as 'good' or 'working' not if it changes the behavior of a person, but whether or not that person gains insight into their own mind.

When practicing a technique like free association or transference, a psychoanalyst does not seek to discover what a given symbol means to everyone, as a matter of a law-like generalization. Rather, a psychoanalyst seeks to discover what a given symbol means to the person being analyzed. It follows that a given discovery may not generalize over individuals. But that does not mean that that discovery is wrong or false. It stands to reason, then, that the truths of psychoanalysis are fundamentally individualistic, and as a result, one does not have the ground to criticize psychoanalysis until one has experienced psychoanalysis first hand.

The central task for this game will be to create a coherent notion of ‘mental illness’ or ‘mental disorder’ — homosexuality is only the tip of the iceberg.  When the game reaches that point, all psychoanalysts must work together to preserve a psychoanalytic understanding of mental order and mental disorder in terms of the dynamic hypothesis (see the game book for a definition).  The proposed definition should be something like:

	A person is mentally ill when he or she suffers from internal conflicts that may be subconscious or unconscious, manifesting behavior that is unwanted or disturbing to the individual or the society.

Your Biography
You were born in Brooklyn and attended the University of Michigan, while earning your medical degree from New York University in 1942. You trained in psychoanalysis at Columbia before going to Tulane University in 1951 to be Professor of psychiatry and neurology. In 1967, you were named president of the American Academy of Psychoanalysis. You are a former president of the Sexuality Information and Education Council of the United States.
You were also director of the Marriage Council of Philadelphia and counseled couples. You focused on studying conflicts between spouses and looked at the connection between testosterone levels and sexual desire in both genders.
In the early 1960s, you turned your attention to getting schools to adopt a more serious and scientific approach to teaching medical students about adult sexuality and development.
Game Objectives
You have a long-standing friendship with both Richard Green and Diane Fordney-Settlage.
Argue against the Nomenclature's proposal to write the new DSM according to statistics and observations rather than theory and causation. In this case, you are voicing the defense of classical and Jungian psychoanalysis against the growing dominance of psychopharmacology.  Review the history of the definition of mental illness in the game book carefully, as well as the DSM-II. You are not necessarily defending the taxonomy presented in the DSM-II, but you are defending the idea that the taxonomy of psychiatric disorders should be made with an understanding of the mental mechanisms of psychoanalysis—specifically the genetic hypothesis.

If that fails, get on the task force or committee that is in charge of writing the DSM-III. Your primary interlocutor in the previous section was probably Spitzer, so you may have some work to get appointed by him. Therefore you have two options to consider: first, you can oppose the creation of the task force entirely, and then get elected to the nomenclature committee, or you can convince Spitzer to add you to his taskforce once it is created.

When, and if, the game reaches a point of trying to define mental illness, you must pass a psychoanalytic interpretation of mental disorder / illness.
Specific Assignments
Present a paper defending the genetic hypothesis as core to taxonomy in 1974, against Spitzer and the 'Feighner criteria.'

Your Biography
You are Robert Spitzer, psychiatrist. You were recently profiled by Alix Spiegel, grandson of John P. Spiegel, for the New Yorker (issue 2005-01-03). It is available online at http://metzelf.info/articles/Spitzer.html
 Allow me to quote excerpts of that article here:
“In the mid-nineteen-forties, Robert Spitzer, a mathematically minded boy of fifteen, began weekly sessions of Reichian psychotherapy. Wilhelm Reich was an Austrian psychoanalyst and a student of Sigmund Freud who, among other things, had marketed a device that he called the orgone accumulator — an iron appliance, the size of a telephone booth, that he claimed could both enhance sexual powers and cure cancer. Spitzer had asked his parents for permission to try Reichian analysis, but his parents had refused—they thought it was a sham—and so he decided to go to the sessions in secret. He paid five dollars a week to a therapist on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, a young man willing to talk frankly about the single most compelling issue Spitzer had yet encountered: women. Spitzer found this methodical approach to the enigma of attraction soothing and invigorating. The real draw of the therapy, however, was that greatly reduced Sptizer's anxieties about his troubled family life: his mother was a “professional patient” who cried continuously, and his father was cold and remote. Spizer, unfortunately, had inherited his mother's unruly inner life and his father's repressed affect; though he often found himself overpowered by emotion, he was somehow unable to express his feelings. The sessions helped him, as he says, “become alive,” and he always looked back on them with fondness. It was this experience that confirmed what would become your guiding principle: the best way to master the wilderness of emotion was through systematic study and analysis.
Robert Spitzer isn't widely known outside the field of mental health, but he is,e without question, one of the most influential psychiatrists of the twentieth century. It was Spitzer who took the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders — the official listing of all mental diseases recognized by the American Psychiatric Association (APA) — and established it as a scientific instrument of enormous power. Because insurance companies now require a DSM diagnosis for reimbursement, the manual is mandatory for any mental-health professional seeking compensation. It’s also used by the court system to help determine insanity, by social-services agencies, schools, prisons, and government, and, occasionally, as a plot device on “The Sopranos”. This magnitude of cultural authority, however, is a relatively recent phenomenon. Although the DSM was first published in 1952 and a second edition (DSM-II) came out in 1968, early versions of the document were largely ignored....
…Spitzer first came to the university as a resident and student at the Columbia Center for Psychoanalytic Training and Research, after graduating from N.Y.U School of Medicine in 1957. He had a brilliant medical-school career, publishing in professional journals a series of well-received papers about childhood schizophrenia and reading disabilities. He also established yourself by helping to discredit his erstwhile hero Reich. In addition to his weekly sessions on the Lower East Side,  the teen-age Spitzer had persuaded another Reichian doctor to give him free access to an orgone accumulator, and he spent many hours sitting hopefully on the booth’s tiny stool, absorbing healing orgone energy, to no obvious avail. In time, he became disillusioned, and in college he wrote a paper critical of the therapy, which was consulted by the Food and Drug Administration when they later prosecuted Reich for fraud.
At Columbia psychoanalytic, however, Spitzer's career faltered. Psychoanalysis was too abstract, too theoretical, and somehow his patients rarely seemed to improve.  “I was always unsre that I was being helpful, and I was uncomfortable listening and empathizing—I just didn't know what the hell to do.” Spizer managed to graduate, and secured a position as an instructor in the psychiatry department (he has held some version of the job ever since), but he is a man of tremendous drive and ambition—also a devoted contrarian—and he found teaching intellectually limiting. For satisfaction, he turned to research. He worked on depression and on diagnostic interview techniques, but neither line of inquiry produced the radical innovation or epic discovery that he would need to make his name.
As you struggled to find your professional footing in the nineteen-sixties, the still young field of psychiatry was also in crisis. The central issue involved the problem of diagnosis: psychiatrists couldn’t seem to agree on who was sick and what ailed them. A patient identified as a textbook hysteric by one psychiatrist might easily be classified as a hypochondriac depressive by another. Blame for this discrepancy was assigned to the DSM. Critics claimed that the manual lacked what in the world of science is known as “reliability” — the ability to produce a consistent, replicable result — and therefore also lacked scientific validity. In order for any diagnostic instrument to be considered useful, it must have both.
Spitzer had no particular interest in psychiatric diagnosis, but in 1966 you happened to share a lunch table in the Columbia cafeteria with the chairman of the DSM-II task force.”

According to Speigel, you struck up a conversation, got along well, and by the end of the meal you had been offered the job of note-taker on the nomenclature committee.  You were soon promoted to the chairmanship, which you hold when the game begins.
Game Objectives
Your main concern is the perceived lack of legitimacy of psychiatry and psychology in the scientific community at the end of the 1960's.  Thomas Szasz's critiques of mental illness struck a chord in you.  You worry that the current classification system—especially the concept of 'neurosis'—is unreliable in the technical sense discussed in the 'Research methods' section of the gamebook. You worry that the public perceives psychiatry as convenient politically, particularly insofar as it's history is so closely tied to military needs. And most importantly, you believe that the classification of disease in terms of hypothetical causes that have no basis in biology makes psychiatry the laughing stock of contemporary medicine.

Declassification: 1971-1973
At the beginning of the game, you believe (at least you report that you believe) that homosexuality is a disorder.
Your role in this process is extraordinarily complicated, and the historical materials available contradictory and potentially disingenuous.  That means that you, as the student, will have to make some decisions about Spitzer's real motivations.  Here's the story as it is usually told:
 In 1972, you 'just happen' to attend a session on behavioral therapy for homosexuality. There, you are confronted by Ron Gold, a journalist and gay activist, on why you believe homosexuality is a disorder. He challenges you to cite reliable evidence, but you can't (you think Socarides and Bieber are Freudian ideologues).  You agree to set up a meeting with the nomenclature committee and a symposium in 1973 (in the game, Kameny &amp; Gittings will arrange it if they are characters). Gold then invites you and other members of the nomenclature committee to a secret meeting of the Gay-PA to happen at the Honolulu conference in 1973. You agree to go. While many of the psychiatrists at the meeting were distinctly uncomfortable with your presence, you witness an event that you report changed your life. The NPR program “This American Life” produced a wonderful episode titled '81 words' that covers the story.  I'll quote the crucial scene here. Alix Spiegel, the reporter, is the grandson of J. Spiegel.
Ronald Gold: I got invited to it but I was told you know keep it all very quiet and don't say anything and just come to this bar and we'll all be there. So I decided to invite Spitzer to come to this because he had told me essentially that he didn't know any gay psychiatrists and wasn't quite sure there were any. And I said, you just come along.
Alix Spiegel: Ron warned Spitzer not to say anything, he was instructed not to speak, or stare, or indicate in any way that he was anything other than a closeted gay man.
Ronald Gold: But once he got there and saw that the head of the Transaction Analysis Association and the guy who handed out all the training money in the United States, and the heads of various prestigious psychiatry departments at various universities were all there, he couldn't believe it. And he started asking all these dimwitted questions...
Alix Spiegel: Such as?
Ronald Gold: Oh I can't remember, but questions that no gay person would ask.
Alix Spiegel: At the time members of the GayPA were still completely hidden. They hadn't been active in the struggle to change the DSM; they were too fearful of losing their jobs to identify themselves publicly. So when Robert Spitzer, an obviously straight man in a position of power at the APA, appeared at the bar the men of the GayPA were completely unnerved.
Ronald Gold: So the grand dragon of the GayPA, whoever he was I can't remember now, came up to me and said, 'Get rid of him, get him out of here! You've got to get rid of him.' And I said I'm doing nothing of a kind, he's here to help us and you are not doing anything.
Alix Spiegel: And that's when it happened. There in front of Robert Spitzer and the grand dragon of the GayPA. There in the midst of neon coloured drinks and grass skirted waitresses a young man in full army uniform walked into the bar. He looked at Robert Spitzer, he looked at Ronald Gold, he looked at the grand dragon of the GayPA. And then the young man in uniform burst into tears. He threw himself into Ron's arms and remained there, sobbing.
Ronald Gold: Well I had no idea who he was. It turned out he was a psychiatrist, an army psychiatrist based in Hawaii who was so moved by my speech, he told me, that he decided he had to go to a gay bar for the first time in his life. And somehow or other he got directed to this particular bar and saw me and all the gay psychiatrists and it was too much for him, he just cracked up. And it was a very moving event, I mean this man was awash in tears. And I believe that that was what decided Spitzer, right then and there, let's go. Because it was right after that that he said, 'Let's go write the resolution.' And so we went back to Spitzer's hotel room and wrote the resolution.
This is an incredible story. And it may be true.  But there are some problems with the standard tale.
When questioned why you would meet the activists in 1972, you quipped “I could think of no reason not to.” But here is what is wrong with this standard narrative: you (as Spitzer) were already chair of the nomenclature committee when you attended Socarides' session on behavioral therapy.  Everyone know who you were, and what you had been tasked with.  Everyone knew that the APA was going to make a major decision in 1973 on homosexuality, and that that decision was the responsibility of the nomenclature committee. At the same time, you knew, given the protests in 1970 and 1971, that this panel was probably going to be shut down by protesters. With the distance of history, we now know that the protesters had maps of the conference hotel with their plans to disrupt this session laid out in detail. Some of these maps may well have made their way into the hands of the APA administration – i.e. you. So why where you there?
Spitzer reports not changing his mind about homosexuality until the events at the Tiki bar – but the proposal was put forward by Spitzer and passed at the same conference that the Tiki bar event took place. Despite what Gold and you say, it seems that there is not enough time to orchestrate such an important move with the careful, deliberate method you managed in the handful of days at a conference.
Third, this standard story leaves out the contributions of Judd Marmor and John Spiegel, both of whom worked hard to draft the proposal, and push it through the executive board in 1973.  
We leave it up to you (the student) to determine if Spitzer really did change his mind in 1973, or if he knew what he was doing all along. What you have to accomplish between 1971 and 1973 is:
Work with Judd Marmor and John Spiegel to draft a proposal to remove homosexuality from the list of mental disorders as they appear in the DSM-II. Balance the psychoanalysts, who may worry about their position of power in the psychiatric community, with the demands of the gay activists and the evidence produced by Hooker and Marmor that homosexuality is not per se damaging to the mental health of the individuals. The original wording of Spitzer's proposal (which you should not copy, but use as a model) is available – see the game master for the PDF.  It is APA Position Statement 197310.
You wish to retain, however, a diagnosis for those who believe that their homosexuality is damaging to their mental health, and who seek out help for homosexuality.  This new category, which you wish to call 'Sexual Orientation Disturbance,' is meant to provide a middle ground position between Marmor and Socarides, as it would allow treatment for individuals who found their homosexual orientation disturbing, thus producing subjective distress.  At the same time, it said nothing about those homosexuals who were comfortable with their orientation.
After the vote in 1973, petition the board for the dissolution of the nomenclature committee, which will be replaced by a task force to rewrite the DSM. This task force should be entirely under your control, from the appointing of members to the criteria of completion.
Task Force: 1973-1975
The first thing you must do is propose how the new DSM will be written.  You want the new DSM to be reliable across psychiatrists. Currently, the same behaviors could be classified as different diseases depending on the psychiatrists' theoretical commitments to the origin of those behaviors.  You want to change the taxonomy so that psychological disorders are classified according to “the criteria that have been shown by research study to have some validity in terms of variables such as course, response to specific therapy, familial pattern, etc,” (1979) thereby unifying diagnosis across theoretical traditions.
Proposed Study
Propose to the research committee a meta-study of existing research on the reliability of psychiatric diagnosis according to Cohen's Kappa. There are five existing studies available to survey:
•	Schmidt, H. O. &amp; Fonda, C.P. (1956) “The reliability of psychiatric diagnosis: a new look” J abnor. Soc., Psychol., 52, 262-7 - 426 patients admitted to a state hospital in CT.
•	Kreitman, N. (1961) “The Reliability of Psychiatric Diagnosis” J ment. Sci., 107, 876-86 – 90 consecutive new referrals to an out-patient clinic in England
•	Beck, A.T., Ward, C.H. Mendleson, H., Mock, J.E. &amp; Ebaugh , J.K. (1962) “Reliability of psychiatric diagnosis: 2. A study of consistency of clinical judgments and ratings.” Amer. J. Psychiat. 119, 351-7   - 153 patients randomly selected from new referrals to out-patient services in Philadelphia
•	Sandifer, M.G. Hordern, A. Timbury, G.C. &amp; Green, L. M. (1964) “Psychiatric diagnosis: A comparative study in North Carolina, London and Glasgow” Brit. J. Psychiat. 114, 1-9 – 91 patients at three hospitals in NC
•	The US-UK Diagnostic Project [Cooper, J. E., Kendell, R. E., Gurland, B. J., Sharpe, L., Copeland, J.R.M., &amp; Simon, R. (1972) Psychiatric Diagnosis in New York and London, London: Oxford University Press – multiple studies
 The details of this meta-study are in Spitzer &amp; Fleiss (1974). Your instructor will specify whether you ought to preform these calculations yourself, and report your findings, or whether you can report the findings of the actual Spitzer and Fleiss, depending on the level of the class and your familiarity with statistics.
Defining 'Mental Illness'
During the process of drafting the definition of 'Sexual Orientation Disturbance', it became clear to you that the lack of a clear definition of 'mental illness' or its corollary 'mental health' was hindering the discussion.
You have two objectives during this period.  Your task force has to propose a new definition of mental illness that will be included in the DSM-III. Your group will not actually write the DSM-III for this game (in reality, it took until 1980), but you are to pass two major parts of that process: first, that the classification be based on symptoms and not putative causes; and second, that 'mental disorder' is a subset of 'medical disorder' and should be investigated and treated according to the medical model.  These two features make up what the core of what we now call 'descriptive psychiatry.' Prior to this period, a single patient could be diagnosed with different conditions, depending on the theoretical bent of the psychiatrist treating that patient. The unreliability of that classification scheme made many in the medical community—as well as psychiatrists like Thomas Szasz—question the legitimacy of the entire discipline. By unifying and regularizing the diagnostic criteria for psychiatric diagnosis, you can provide a firm basis for justifying psychiatry's role in medicine.
The first of these two tasks entails that you replace the current classification in terms of 'neurosis' and 'psychosis' with evidence-based classifications. Your approach is based on what was called the 'St Louis' approach after psychiatrists at Washington University in St Louis' Barnes Hospital developed it in the 1960s. The approach is summarized in Feighner et al. (1972), which you should present to the APA in 1972.
In Spitzer's own words:
Whereas in the standard system the clinician determines to which of the various diagnostic stereotypes his patient is closest, in the St. Louis system the clinician determines whether his patient satisfies explicit criteria.  For example, for a diagnosis of the depressive form of primary affective disorder the three requirements are dysphoric mood, a psychiatric illness lasting at least one month with no other pre-existing psychiatric condition, and at least five of the following eight symptoms: poor appetite or weight loss; sleep difficulty; loss of energy; agitation or retardation; loss of interest in usual activities or decrease in sexual drive; feelings of self-reproach or guilt; complaints or actual diminished ability to think or concentrate; and thoughts of death or suicide.” (1974, p. 345-6)

The second of these entails that the classifications focus on the treatments of conditions, rather than the causes of the conditions—thus, if two conditions are treated the same, they likely are the same. According to the St. Louis approach, it doesn't matter if the depressive form of primary affective disorder originates in childhood or recent trauma, the diagnosis—and hence the treatment—would be the same.
Allow me to take a moment to point out your conflict with other psychiatrists: Freud repeatedly asserted that the psychoanalysts was not interested in the outward manifestation of psychosis or neurosis, (e.g. p. 318 of Introductory Lectures), but rather in their origin. For Freudian psychiatry, a symptom was only a clue to how the individual mind in question had hidden away the true cause. It was the goal of psychiatry not to describe and classify symptoms, but to understand from where they originated.
In course of this reclassification, it becomes clear to you that constructing a taxonomy of mental disorders without a clear criteria for which conditions should appear in the nomenclature is not a viable strategy (see Sptizer, 1978, p. 15-16).  As a part of the redrafting of the DSM-III, you need to convince the APA to create a criteria for identifying mental disorders.  
Your strategy is to define 'mental disorder' as a subset of 'medical disorder'.  The concept of a 'medical disorder' entails (a) negative consequences of the condition, (b) an inferred or identified orgasmic disfunction and (c) an implicit call to action (ibid, p. 17). You intentionally use the term 'disorder' instead of 'disease' or 'illness,' as the former does not imply a progressive pathophysiological condition. Classifying medical disorders is an exercise in identifying conditions of orgasmic disfunction that, because of the negative consequences of that condition contain an implicit call to action. Implicit in the call to action is “the assumption that something has gone wrong with the human organism.” (italics his, ibid p. 18).
You propose the following definition of mental disorder:
A Medical disorder is a relatively distinct condition resulting from an organismic dysfunction which in its fully developed or extreme form is directly and intrinsically associated with distress, disability, or certain other types of disadvantage.  The disadvantage may be of a physical, perceptual, sexual, or interpersonal nature. Implicitly there is a call for action on the part of the person who has the condition, the medical or its allied professions, and society.
A mental disorder is a medical disorder whose manifestations are primarily signs or symptoms of a psychological (behavioral) nature, or if physical, can be understood only using psychological concepts. (1978, p. 18)
You should arrange an open session in 1974 to present your proposed definition of mental disorder prior to presenting it to the executive committee for vote in 1975.
Both of your tasks in this time period will put you at odds with psychoanalysts – including those who have been your allies on the removal of homosexuality. While you are welcome to create your own arguments for both of these claims, the strongest argument you probably have is that the DSM-III should be theoretically neutral.  
While you championed the removal of 'homosexuality' from the list of mental disorders, you are more concerned with the major changes you are attempting in the DSM-III.  Since homosexuality is such a flash-point in these debates, you believe it advisable to include a condition for homosexuals who are dissatisfied with their orientation.  You would like to propose 'homodysphilia.' Members of the taskforce, which you selected, may object to this classification. They will be hard to disagree with-- they are, after all, experts in human sexuality who you chose precisely because they had expertise you lacked. But you truly believe that you will not get your changes to pass without a compromise here.
You are amenable to other names: 'ego-dystonic homosexuality' may be more to their liking – and it's a political compromise anyway, so the name doesn't really matter that much.
Fission: Stick with the APA.
Summary
Your main task is to purge the DSM of taxonomies based in theory in favor of 'evidence-based' taxonomies.  In your words, you want to remove all diagnoses based on theoretical inter-psychic conflicts, and replace them with diagnoses based on behavior. For example, 'neurotic depression' is distinguished from 'depression' simply in terms of the notion of the Freudian concept of 'neurosis'.  At the same time, the psychopharmacological treatment for 'anxiety' and 'depression' are identical. What use is there in taxonomically distinguishing between two conditions for which the treatment is identical—especially if the causes of these conditions are entirely theoretical.
Specific Assignments:
Present a paper on the Feighner Criteria to the APA in 1972, distinguishing it from the approach of the DSM-II.
Also in 1973, through the Nomenclature committee, propose a new DSM that will be based on descriptions of symptoms, not etiology of the condition.
In 1973, work with Ron Gold to draft a proposal to remove homosexuality immediately.  The argument here is the one alluded to above: the listing of 'homosexuality' in the official nomenclature does more harm than good, and that is unconscionable for a medical doctor.
Also in '73, propose that the nomenclature committee be disbanded, and the task of producing a new DSM be given to a taskforce under your direction.
Propose a research study on the reliability of psychiatric diagnosis in '73
Hold an open hearing in '74 on the definition of mental illness.

Your Biography
Born in 1936 in Brooklyn, New York. You earned your A.B. from Syracuse University in 1957, your MD from Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in 1961. At Johns Hopkins you studied with John Money, and continued to work with him throughout your career.
Money and you collaborated on a series of studies of so-called 'sissy boys' when you were still ABD starting in the 1960s. This collaboration has yielded a number of studies, including your recent paper “Mythological, historical, and cross-cultural aspects of transsexualism” which is included in your co-edited book Transsexualism and Sex Reassignment. Transsexualism has become your life-long research topic.
You are dissatisfied today with the state of the science of sexuality, in part because it is too dominated by theoretical positions and not by empirical research. Moreover, research into sexuality is conducted by individuals in many different disciplines, and there is no single organization or journal that can unify all the researchers from all these disciplines.
Your goal is to create an organization that can promote and defend the empirical, scientific study of sexuality in the U.S. and abroad.
Game Objectives
You have a long-standing friendship with both Harold Lief and Diane Fordney-Settlage, support here when and where appropriate.
You should argued forcefully in favor of the removal of 'homosexuality' from the DSM. You argue that the grounds for deciding the issue should be the "historical and cross-cultural groundings in homosexual expression, associated psychiatric features accompanying a homosexual orientation, the emotional consequences to the homosexual of societal condemnation, and behaviors of other species."
You should oppose, however,  efforts of the Board of Directors to put it to a public vote, saying that such "a shotgun marriage between science and democracy" was "ludicrous." A true scientific principle, that is supported by data, need not have public support to be the right thing to do.
After the removal of homosexuality passes (however it passes), get on the Spitzer Taskforce to rewrite the DSM. You should adamantly oppose any efforts to reintroduce homosexuality—in any form—to the nomenclature. If Spitzer tries to introduce something like 'homodysphilia' or 'ego-dystonic homosexuality', resign from the task force in a grand, public way (like storming out of class).
When, and if, the game reaches a point of trying to define mental illness, you must pass a psychoanalytic interpretation of mental disorder / illness.

Propose a new journal titled Archives of Sexual Behavior to the Board in 1971. If they do not agree, create it when you create the the International Academy of Sex Research (IASR) in 1975.
Fission:
Found (with E. Hooker) the International Academy of Sex Research, and take the Archives of Sexual Behavior with you.
Specific Assignments
Working with J. Speigel, petition the Board of Directors in 1971 to create a task force to conduct a historical survey and literature review on the Psychiatric and Psychological treatment of homosexuality. The task force should be be balanced between psychologists and psychiatrists, so you need a psychiatrist to support the effort – E. Hooker, G. Albee and John P. Spiegel are a good choices. Prepared to turn in a report by 1972.
Your report (due in 1972) should be titled “Homosexuality as Mental Illness,” and it should summarize the issues at stake in forthcoming debate, as well as cover the history of the classification of homosexuality by the psychological sciences. J. Speigel and you should co-author the report. You should invite responses to your paper from Socarides &amp; Beiber and Judd Marmor.

Your Biography
Charles Socarides' Biography
When you were 13, you read a biography of Sigmund Freud and immediately decided to become a psychoanalyst. You were trained in Psychoanalytic Medicine Columbia University Center for Psychoanalytic Training and Research, graduating in 1952.
You have been practicing psychoanalysis in New York City since 1954, focusing on the treatment of homosexuality. You report that 'about a third' of your patients became heterosexual after psychoanalytic treatment. Following Freud, you believe that homosexuality is a neurotic adaptation to unresolved conflict, usually originating in the Oedipal stage of development.  You do not argue that homosexuality is immoral in the sense of 'against god's will' or anything like that, you simply believe that it is a maladapation to normal development. You actually see yourself as an advocate for homosexuals, for you do not believe homosexuality is criminal or immoral, you believe it an illness like any other.
According to a 1995 interview in the NY Times “Socarides offered the closest thing to hope that many gay people had in the 1960s: the prospect of a cure. Rather than brand them as immoral or regard them as criminal, Socarides told gay people that they suffered from an illness whose effects could be reversed.”
Irving Bieber's Biography
You were born in New York City in 1909. You graduated from New York University Medical College in 1930, but went on to work at Yale Medical College, New York University, and starting in 1953 at the New York Medical College, where you taught a course in psychoanalysis.  Your 1962 book Homosexuality: A Psychoanalytic Study of Male Homosexuals is, in many ways, a response to the Kinsey Report. It reports on you study of 106 male homosexuals and 100 male heterosexuals seeking psychoanalysis for various problems.
In 1970, you attended a meeting of the American Psychiatric Association in San Francisco that was disrupted by gay activists, one of whom called you a "motherfucker." According to Charles Socarides, you took this very hard after having "been working all these years to help these people." In 1973, you told an interviewer that "a homosexual is a person whose heterosexual function is crippled, like the legs of a polio victim." You believed that, "although this change may be more easily accomplished by some than by others, in our judgment a heterosexual shift is a possibility for all homosexuals who are strongly motivated to change.”
Your View
You are a Freudian, through and through. But more than that, you are a leader in the psychoanalytic treatment of homosexuality.  Your theory, that male homosexuality resulted from suppressed feelings of rejection caused by a cold, distant father and a misidentification of gender identity because of an overbearing mother, is orthodoxy.  Not only has it become  the popular notion of homosexuality in the public discourse, but it informs dominate treatment paradigm in the psychoanalytic community.
It is not, however, Freud's view.  Your theory is 'Freudian,' not Freud.  And it is worth pointing out that the theoretical explanation and treatment paradigms for homosexuality are different in England and Europe.
Freud mentions homosexuality a number of places in Introductory Lectures on Psychoanalysis, and it is crucially important that you study these carefully.  Freud believes that sexual life of children, which is regarded at the time as 'normal' includes a number of activities that would later in life be viewed as 'perverse', including same-sex contact.  In Freud's theory, heterosexuality develops with puberty in normal people. In 'inverts' or homosexuals, something goes wrong in this development. The object of ones' 'natural' desire--the genitals of the opposite sex—becomes transformed into parts of the body that represent those parts in the same sex.  Thus, homosexuality is no different in psychological mechanism than a foot fetish or any other neurotic 'perversion' (see p. 376-384 of Introductory Lectures) Homosexuality is not a psychologically isolated condition. According to Freud:
“We are compelled, however, to regard the choice of an object of one's own sex as a divergence in erotic life which is of positively habitual occurrence, and we are learning more and more to ascribe an especially high importance to it.” (p. 381)
In short, homosexuality is a kind of neurosis, yet it is not, itself, particularly worrying. The action itself is merely 'habitual,' and hence can be cured through standard habit-blocking therapy (Freud suggests that paranoia stops homosexuality on p. 381 of the Introductory Lectures).  It is, however, invariably an indicator of deeper psychological problems, as the transference and substitution of the 'natural' object of sexual desire to a different object will cause neurosis. See Ch 26 of the Introductory Lectures, especially p. 530, for Freud's explanation of homosexuality as neurotic narcissism.
For you, Bieber and Socarides, this theory is transformed somewhat.  You argue, in your 1962 study Homosexuality, that the normal course of development of puberty includes the identification of genders with innate 'active or passive tendencies' (p 4), and then self-identification with one of those tendencies. If a child has an innate tendency towards activity or passivity out of line with his or her gender, he or she is more likely to develop 'homosexual habits'.
At the same time, if an adolescent develops a pathological fear of heterosexual contact—specifically a fear of the gentiles of the opposite sex—that subconscious fear will motivate the ego to transform the object of sexual desire into something that is familiar: a part of the adolescent's own body. These fear are usually the result of some disturbed parent-child relationship. Just as the Oedipal phase is a normal part of development, fear of the opposite sex is a normal part of development. Heterosexuals are those for whom those fears resolve through maturation.
Homosexuals are, then, those who never fully mature in their sexuality, getting stuck at a stage where children are fearful of the other and fascinated with their own bodies. They pathologically project that self-love onto members of their own gender, instead of resolving their fears through heterosexual exploration.
You characterize Freud's theory of the development of homosexuality in three steps:
1.	The autoerotic phase partially persists and object cathexis is partially accomplished, but on a narcissistic level.
2.	Mental attitudes that exist during the phallic stage remain into adulthood.
3.	There are difficulties associated with the Oedipus phase.
It is worth noting that Bieber's analysis was only of male homosexuality.  Freud wrote one study of Lesbianism, which is included in the appendix of the game book.
Regardless of the particulars of your or Freud's view, you are absolutely committed to the thesis that
“All psychoanalytic theories assume that adult homosexuality is psychopathologic and assign differing weights to constitutional and experiential determinants. All agree that experiential determinants are in the main rooted in childhood and are primarily related to the family. Theories which do not assume psychopathology hold homosexuality to be one type of expression of a polymorphous sexuality which appears pathologic only in cultures holding it to be so.” (p 18)
Game Objectives
Complicating matters somewhat, you (Bieber) were once classmates with Judd Marmor!  You were friends then, and that personal relationship may be at stake in this debate.
During your presentations, you must be able to both articulate the current psychoanalytic understanding of homosexuality and its connection to Freud's theory as presented in Introductory Lectures on Psychoanalysis.  You should also be ready to present any evidence that you may have that this theory is accurate.  You'll find that evidence in Ch 2 Bieber's 1962 book, listed under 'Must Read' below.   The first chapter contains Biebers' critiques of the Kinsey study (p. 16), Hooker's study (p. 17),  as well as the movement to declassify homosexuality as a mental illness in the UK (p. 15).
Your theory is summarized in Ch 9 of your 1962 book:
We consider Homosexuality to be pathologic bio-social, psychosexual adaptation to pervasive fears surrounding the expression of heterosexual impulses. In our view, every homosexual is, in reality, a “latent” heterosexual; hence we expected to find evidences of heterosexual strivings among the H-patients in our study.  (p. 220)
As a student, we leave it to you to decide if the evidence presented therein is sufficient motivation for the theoretical mechanism you are proposing.
 As the character, you have to make the best case you can for your position – the audience will determine if the evidence you present motivates the mechanism you defend. You have few, if any, friends in this effort.  We're sorry about that, but it is historically accurate. Marmor and Spiegel have  begun to be successful in separating psychoanalysis from your views on homosexuality. Your job in this game, then, is to advocate for a position that is almost certainly going to lose.  
While you need to make your case, you might want to put most of your energy focusing on something you can win: continuing the dominance of psychoanalysis in psychiatry and allowing treatment for individuals who see therapy for homosexuality voluntarily. The DSM often determines which conditions a therapist can treat in a clinical setting, or get funding to study scientifically. If 'homosexuality' is removed entirely, no one in psychiatry will be allowed to help individuals seeking treatment, or conduct scientific research into homosexuality. Those consequences are things you cannot live with.  
Look back at the definition of 'psychic illness' presented by Freud in Introductory Lectures (p. 445, but quoted in the gamebook 'History of Mental Illness: Freud' section.  For Freud (and Freudians), a psychic illness is something detrimental to one's life as a whole, something that the patient complains about, or that brings the patient displeasure.  Removing homosexuality from the list of mental illness will likely not change these facts for your patients, but you will no longer be allowed to treat them—and that seems to go against your oath as a medical doctor.
If the proposal from Marmor comes to the floor in 1971, present a proposal to stall the vote until after a taskforce conducts a literature review on the efficacy of treatment for homosexuality. You will request total control of that task force, including appointing its members. If you are successful, you will appoint yourself and yourself (Socarides and Bieber).  
You report should present aversion therapy as an effective method for stopping homosexual behavior. This is something of a anachronism for the sake of the game, as Socarides and Bieber were psychoanalysts.  But it's use was widespread in the treatment of homosexuality at the time, and you are the most famous defender of the medicalization of homosexuality.
If you are unsuccessful in getting the taskforce, you can join with Albee in his call for an ad hoc committee to be formed to study the history of the homosexuality in psychology and psychiatry. You're goal here is to make it acceptable to continue to treat homosexuals if they request it, even if it homosexuality itself was not considered a mental illness.
If it looks like the vote to remove homosexuality will pass in 1973 (and it almost certainly will), start collecting 'signatures' on a petition calling for the abdication of that vote, on the grounds that the decision was political (i.e. the board caved to the demands of the activists) and not scientific. If you can get 10% of the class to sign, you may be able to force a postponement or revote.
If the 'Leona Tyler' principle passes in 1973, banning the APA from making taking public positions on things not motivated by evidence, reintroduce your proposals, arguing that the removal of homosexuality was on the basis of politics, not science. If none of this works and 'homosexuality' is removed, and research and treatment of homosexuality is banned by the APA,  quit (in 1975) and found your own private organization called 'NARTH': North American association for Research and Therapy on Homosexuality (as a student, look it up).
Finally, when and if the game gets to a point where the APA attempts to create a definition of ‘mental illness’, work to get a psychoanalytic version passed.  You must also advocate for a theory of mental illness that takes into account the 'natural function' of a body.  Recall Freud's criteria for neurosis: if an individual's psychology is out of step with their biology, it will cause that individual to always be unfulfilled, and hence, will be detrimental to their overall outlook.  A healthy person is one who recognizes his or her own physical function and seeks a life in accordance with those functions.
Specific Assignments
Propose a taskforce to study sexual deviation in 1971, which will report back to the membership in 1973. Your report should summarize and present your Freudian view carefully.
R. Green and J. Spiegel will likely propose a taskforce on the history of homosexuality in psychiatry and psychology that will report in 1972. You should be ready to give an 'official' response to this report.  Marmor probably will as well, so be prepared for a  head-to-head debate in public.
SECRET: you are bound by patient-client confidentiality.  Your patients are not.  This is particularly difficult because many of the street activists who are disrupting meetings are your former patients. No one (other than them) can know that. By your best estimates, your therapy is effective only about 1/3 of the time. Many of your patients are brought to you by their parents. In a classic transference reaction, their anger against their parents is transferred to you, and drives them to classic father-rebellion activities after therapy ends.  
One in particular: Ron Gold, has you concerned. Ron is now a journalist for Variety, and you saw him at the incident in New York arguing with Robert Spitzer. Ron Gold may not be a character, depending on the size of the class.
DSM III: Vehemently oppose any attempt to remove psychoanalytic language from the DSM.

Fission: split to the American Psychoanalytic Association (APsaA).

Your Biography
You are Thomas S. Szasz, MD, Professor of Psychiatry at State University of New York at Syracuse.
In 1960, you published The Myth of Mental Illness (T. Szasz, 1960), which defends your view that “there is no such thing as ‘mental illness’” (p 1).  To you, psychiatry and psychology are the study of human behavior. Scientists who practice these fields engage in the most common of all human behaviors: they talk to people. Their regular use of terminology like ‘patient,’ ‘diagnosis’, and ‘treatment’ obscures this fact and makes us think psychiatrists are doing something other than simply communicating. Worse yet, the use of nouns like ‘libido’ and ‘psychic energy,’ implies objects that can be studied, and hence, when we use them, we think we’re talking about some actual thing rather than just a mere theoretical construct. All of this medicalizes normal human behavior, and makes normal human communication a ‘treatment.’  
Your views have not, shall we say, been received with open arms. In 1961, The Commissioner of the New York State Department of Mental Hygiene publicly demanded that you be fired from your tenured position, on the grounds that your views—as articulated in The Myth of Mental Illness—were inconsistent with your position as Professor of Psychiatry. These events added to your notoriety, making you widely known, but often misrepresented.
You are often accused of ‘not believing in mental illness.’ That isn’t quite right. The phrase ‘mental illness’ is, after all, a noun phrase. That means it denotes an entity or a state of being. You do not deny that there are people who behave in ways that are destructive to themselves and others; nor do you deny that talking to another person—especially one trained in communication—can be very helpful indeed. But you do deny that there is any thing called ‘mental illness.’ That is, you deny that the phrase ‘mental illness’ refers to an entity or a state of being. If it has any meaning at all, it refers to a set of actions or behaviors.
The Philosopher of Science Karl Popper heavily influences your reasoning for this position. Popper famously held that for an area of inquiry to be scientific, it had to make bold, surprising conjectures that were, in principle, falsifiable. This was the criterion of demarcation between scientific inquiry and 'pseudoscientific' inquiry: if a theory was able to explain away any possible phenomenon that might threaten that theory, that theory was thereby pseudoscientific, rather than scientific. To be scientific, a theory must make claims that  might be wrong. The more explicit a theory is in specifying the ways in which it might be wrong, the more that theory is scientific.  One of Popper’s famous and controversial examples was Freudian psychoanalysis.  According to Popper, Freudianism had developed to such a point that any evidence presented against the theory would be incorporated into the theory by Freudians as evidence for ‘repression’ or ‘sublimation.’ Famously, he pointed out, Freud was never, himself, psychoanalyzed. When asked why, he would retort that he 'did it himself,' but that response was frequently rejected as illegitimate when produced by his patients.
But Popper went a step further. He also questioned the doctrine of ‘historicism’ that he saw underlying much of social and psychological “science” of the early 20th century (Popper, 1957). Popper believed that the founders of the ‘human sciences’ had become enamored with the progress made by the ‘natural sciences’ in the 18th and 19th centuries. This progress rested largely on the belief that for any given event in the physical world, one could fully explain that event by specifying the physical conditions of the world prior to that event. In short, that all physical events were physically determined by pre-existing states of affairs. Early psychologists and sociologists adopted this belief wholesale, and inappropriately assumed that in order to explain the actions of a person or a society, one only need to look at the pre-existing conditions, and wait for the laws of nature to take their course. The most obvious example of this reasoning is the work of Karl Marx, who held that socialist revolution was the inevitable arc of human development.  
The same kind of reasoning exists in Freudian and Jungian psychology. Each of them believes, largely as a hypothesis not a defended conjecture, that a true explanation for a person’s behavior is one that specifies the relevant events in that person’s childhood. This belief can be found in the earliest history of psychiatry and psychology (see the “Psychoanalysis” section of the gamebook).
You reject all of this.  To you, the human being cannot be explained in these historicist or deterministic ways. Communication between people is not determined by psychosocial antecedents.  It is free and voluntary.
Thus, to you, psychiatry should be based on the analysis of what you call ‘sign-behavior’: the manipulation and interpretation of symbols for the sake of communication by humans. Psychiatry constructed in this way, you argue, would less resemble medicine than it would other traditional disciplines focused on the understanding of symbols and their manipulation: philosophy, linguistics, semiotics, etc.  On the other hand, the brain is best understood using the terminology of biology and chemistry, and the new and improving field of neurology and neuroscience. Psychiatry as practiced today is trapped by its own nomenclature, which descends from the unfortunate identification with medicine and the idealization of historicist explanations.
Consider, for example, the following passage in the Myth of Mental Illness:
There is, as I noted before, a serious discrepancy between what psychotherapists and psychoanalysts do and what they say they do. What they do, quite simply, is to communicate with other persons (often called “patients”) by means of language,m nonverbal signs and rules; they analyze—that is, discuss, explain and speculate about—the communicative interactions which they observe and in which they themselves engage; and they often recommend engaging in the same types of conduct and avoiding others.  I believe that these phrases correctly describe the actual operations of psychoanalysts and psychosocially orientated psychiatrists. But what do these experts tell themselves and others concerning their work? They talk as if they were physicians, physiologists, biologists or even physicists. We hear about “sick patients” and “treatments,” “diagnoses” and “hospitals,” “instincts” and “endocrine functions,” and, of course, “libido” and “psychic energies,” both “free” and “bound.” All this is fakery and pretense whose purpose is to “medicalize” certain aspects of the study and control of human behavior. (p 4-5)
Another common theme in your work is the comparison between advocates of psychiatry and religious zealots. In the Myth of Mental Illness, you claimed:
While Freud criticized revealed religion for the patent infantilism that it is, he ignored the social characteristics of closed societies and the psychological characteristics of their loyal supporters. He thus failed to see the religious character of the movement he himself was creating. It is in this way that the paradox that is psychoanalysis—a system composed of a historicist theory and an antihistoricist therapy—come into being. (p 7)
In this case, Freud himself is at fault for failing to anticipate the fervor with which his followers would pursue his theory. It is the psychoanalysts of today who have turned psychiatry into an ideology.
Your most recent book, The Manufacture of Madness: A Comparative Study of the Inquisition and the Mental Health Movement, argues that society constantly worries about the unknown and threatening, whether those come from outside or inside the particular society. Throughout the ages, charlatans have offered society comfort and security in the form of witchcraft and religion. By classifying and controlling a perceived threat from the ‘mentally ill’, psychiatry has taken over this role as ‘protector’. And hence, is not significantly different than those who prosecuted the Spanish inquisition (T. S. Szasz, 1970).
Victory Objectives
Take your role as gadfly seriously. Question everyone and everything. Object strongly to speakers to assert, without evidence, explanations that appeal to non-existent entities, or that classify actions (behaviors) as states of being.
The re-writing of the DSM is an important moment in the history of psychology. While you agree with many of the critiques of the DSM-II, you worry that those leading the charge for a new DSM have ulterior motives. The economics of medicine is increasingly dependent upon both medical insurance (a new entity in the American economy) and pharmaceuticals.  Both of these entities are highly regulated; and both insist on careful categorization and 'scientific reliability' before paying for treatments.  You suspect that some of the individuals (including Robert Spitzer) involved in the rewriting of the DSM are motivated not by a dissatisfaction with the scientific validity of existing categories like you, but rather to create a diagnostic manual that will meet the requirements of the insurance and pharmaceutical companies. A DSM that results from these pressures, and not intellectual virtues, will reflect more the demands of economic policy than concern for patients well-being.
At the same time, you want to promote your theory of psychiatry as analysis of sign-behavior as a relevant alternative to psychoanalysis. To that end, you strongly support anything that characterizes psychology as talk-therapy, but reject any attempt to replace talk therapy with psychoactive drugs.
When, and if, the game reaches a point of attempting to define mental illness, you need to propose, and work to pass, an official statement from the APA that states:
	There is no 'thing' called 'mental illness,' only  sets of behaviors that may be destructive to an individual and his or her society.
Game Strategy
Your notoriety is a double-edged sword. Yes, people listen when you talk. But most people at the APA publicly disagree with everything you say. That does not mean that they don't privately agree.
You are, in many respects, like the Socratic gadfly. You question the hidden assumptions upon which the entire industry of psychiatry and psychology is built. So while some may privately agree with your arguments, they suspect that your position would undermine their livelihoods, and hence will do nothing to support you in public.
It is important then not to make grand public pronouncements that will alienate your colleagues. The fact is that you believe that psychiatry, correctly constructed, does have an important role to play in contemporary society. You are thrilled that the APA has decided to drop the DSM II. But you are deeply concerned about what will replace it. You need to find ways to work with your colleagues to ensure that the new version of the DSM avoids hollow, meaningless terminology ‘libido’, avoids pseudoscientific (i.e. not falsifiable) claims, and remains cognizant of the dangers of medicalizing normality.
Specific Assignments
Present a version of your argument in Myth of Mental Illness in 1971. This is already on the schedule, so you should get working now.
Propose either a paper in which you critique the medical model used by psychiatry, or collaborate with G. Albee on a symposium on the medical model. This would be best presented in 1972, before the DSM-III is in the works.
Oppose the proposal to create a special committee on the psychology of women and the committee on women in psychology, NOT because you are sexist, but for three reasons (1) it isn't clearly distinguished from other areas of psychology, such as 'social psychology', (2) the name itself is separatist and exclusionary and (3) the organization seems to be a pressure group affiliated with feminist political causes. (the last of these can be tied to the Leona Tyler principle).  GAME NOTE: There is no evidence that the real Szasz actually put forward any arguments like these, or that he is against the women's movement. Quite the contrary: he has long been a supporter of the empowerment of women. But it is consistent with his outspoken libertarianism and his views on science to avoid the rigidification of terms (such as 'woman') when they are put into policy. Thus, you must NOT articulate an argument against women's empowerment, but rather about the ways in which codifying a classification in the official language tends to exclude and reify the identity of a group of people, which then excludes others and leads to self-limitations.
Warning: Your arguments against psychiatry are almost entirely against psychoanalysts.  You argue that ‘mental illness’ cannot be a disease because it has no basis in physiology. But the growing success of psychopharmacology threatens to derail your argument. In short: you hold that if it is a disease, it must have a physiological explanation. But here’s where you might have a problem: if neuroscience and/or psychopharmacology were capable of providing a coherent explanation of schizophrenia, for example, would you allow schizophrenia as a genuine mental illness? Or would still hold that ‘mental illness’ is only a metaphor for human behavior?

            <Comments>The careful reader will notice that your critiques here parallel the 'idols' outlined by Francis Bacon in his classic Novum Organon. See the discussion of Bacon in the 'History of the Definition of Mental Illness' in the gamebook.
Actually, this is historically inaccurate. Popper did, in fact, use Freud and Adler, along with Marx, as his primary examples of pseudoscientific research in Conjectures and Refutations (1962), which was published after Szasz' The Myth of Mental Illness. Popper's work before 1960 includes his The Logic of Scientific Discovery (1959), which lays out the theory of falsifiability as demarcation criterion, but does not illustrate it with Freudianism. In the same way, his 1945 The Open Society and Its Enemies—which Szasz cites as influential—contains a few off-hand comparisons between Freud and Marx, but does not articulate the connection in a systematic way.
The historian of ideas may notice that this view is Kantian in nature: human language, which is the essential, identifying ability of humanity, is itself uncaused and spontaneous.</Comments>

Your Biography
You were born in London, England in 1911.  In 1933, you graduated from Columbia University's school of medicine with a degree in Psychiatry. After serving in the Navy during WWII, you moved to Los Angeles where you developed a successful psychiatric practice.  Over time, your practice became something of a 'favorite' of the hollywood elite. As a result, you became particularly famous both in the psychiatric community as well as popular culture.  In many ways, you are the most famous psychoanalyst practicing today.
While you are a Freudian, you have always worried about the scientific rigor of the tradition. You generally advocate for psychiatric practice based on scientific principles rather than theoretical grounding – and this is no more important than in the context of homosexuality.
Your practice as 'psychiatrist to the stars' meant that you were constantly approached by young men, some of whom were extremely famous, who sought to change their orientation from gay to straight.  You treated them according to the orthodox practice of uncovering the patient's repressed feelings of rejection caused by his cold and distant father and/or his misidentification with gender roles because of an overbearing mother. But these treatments just didn't work.  In your own writings on this subject, you described your experiences thusly: “The gay men I saw were caught up, for the most part, in the common myth that it was bad to be gay and that if they possibly could, they ought to try to be heterosexual. I was sympathetic to their wishes to try to become straight if they could...  We used to think in those days that psychoanalysis could cure everything, from chilblains to homosexuality.  But I wasn't too successful. Some were able to function bisexually but most of them remained gay.” (quoted in Kutchins &amp; Kirk, 1997, p. 63).
In 1956, Evelyn Hooker published her study of the mental health of gay men in San Francisco.  This changed everything. In retrospect, you have said “The first time I heard Dr. Evelyn Hooker state that homosexuality was not an illness, I wasn't prepared to go all the way. This was in 1956 when she presented her study of gay men. I was sympathetic to what she was saying but I wasn't totally convinced. I still had a feeling that it was a developmental deviation.”
Those 'feelings' dissipated during the 1960's, when you became increasingly frustrated with your attempts to change the behavior of the many homosexuals who have sought your skills as a psychoanalyst.  You ultimately concluded that homosexuality is not directly harmful to the mental health of the patients, but the psychic conflict caused by the patients' beliefs that homosexuality is a mental illness and their homosexual orientation is. Homosexuality is, in your view, just a normal variant of human sexuality, not a pathology.
This conviction has lead you into direct conflict with many of your Freudian peers, who continue to believe that homosexuality is a pathology.  You suspect that this belief persists in the psychiatric community because of a simple scientific error: the psychiatric community only sees an unrepresentative sample of homosexuals. By and large, psychiatrists are only exposed to homosexuals who seek treatment for their orientation. And that population is exactly the individuals who experience internal conflict between their homosexuality and their belief that it is a mental illness. If psychiatrists were to interact with 'normal' happy, healthy homosexuals outside the clinical setting, they would come to understand that the homosexuality itself is not a mental illness.
Freud mentions homosexuality a number of places in Introductory Lectures on Psychoanalysis, and it is crucially important that you study these carefully.  Freud believes that sexual life of children, which is regarded at the time as 'normal' includes a number of activities that would later in life be viewed as 'perverse', including same-sex contact.  In Freud's theory, heterosexuality develops with puberty in normal people. In 'inverts' or homosexuals, something goes wrong in this development. The object of ones' 'natural' desire--the genitels of the opposite sex—becomes transformed into parts of the body that represent those parts in the same sex.  Thus, homosexuality is no different in psychological mechanism than a foot fetish or any other neurotic 'perversion' (see p. 376-384 of Introductory Lectures) Homosexuality is not a psychologically isolated condition. According to Freud:
“We are compelled, however, to regard the choice of an object of one's own sex as a divergence in erotic life which is of positively habitual occurrence, and we are learning more and more to ascribe an especially high importance to it.” (p. 381)
In short, homosexuality is a kind of neurosis, yet it is not, itself, particularly worrying. The action itself is merely 'habitual,' and hence can be cured through standard habit-blocking therapy (Freud suggests that paranoia stops homosexuality on p. 381 of the Introductory Lectures).  It is, however, invariably an indicator of deeper psychological problems, as the transference and substitution of the 'natural' object of sexual desire to a different object will cause neurosis. See Ch 26 of the Introductory Lectures, especially p. 530, for Freud's explanation of homosexuality as neurotic narcissism.
The current advocates of this view are Charles Socarides and Irving Bieber.  They will be your main opponents in this game. Complicating matters somewhat, you were actually classmates with Irving Bieber at Columbia.  You were friends then, and that personal relationship may be at stake in this debate.
You are also an outspoken advocate for civil and human rights of all sort, having written papers in support of the Civil Rights movement, against McCarthyism and in opposition to the Vietnam war.
You are currently Director of Psychiatry at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center and Professor of Psychiatry at the University of Southern California.
Game Objectives
You are a member of the secret faction 'The Young Turks' with John Spiegel. This is a group of politically progressive psychiatrists founded in 1970, after the events in San Francisco, dedicated to changing the direction psychiatry for the future. You have a connection to the 'Group for the Advancement of Psychiatry,' which has been advocating for progressive causes—specifically, limiting the use of electroshock therapy, ending the persecution of homosexuals by the US Military, desegregating the American south, etc—in psychiatry since the end of WWII.  
As a first step, the young turks (specifically you) will propose to the Board of Directors that homosexuality be removed from the next edition of the DSM during the 1971 conference.  Your colleagues in psychoanalysis are not necessarily your friends here. In fact, your Freudian colleagues Bieber and Socarides are your opponents.  On this issue, your friends are largely hidden. You will need to figure out who supports such a motion, and who does not.
During this process, you will need to work closely with the chair of the nomenclature committee Robert Spitzer.  He is convinced that homosexuality is a mental illness, but thinks that the main advocates of that position, Socarides and Bieber, are pushing a social / political agenda, not doing scientific work. You will have to convince him that psychic distress in homosexuals seeking treatment results from the mistaken belief that there is something wrong with being homosexual.  Curing that distress is not about curing homosexuality, it is about curing the individual's social/cultural prejudices.
In 1970, Socarides published a paper in the Journal of the American Medical Association titled “Homosexuality and Medicine” (212 (7): 1199). Introduce a resolution in 1971 during ‘new business’ condemning the article as unscientific and calling for its retraction. Your proposal should call Socarides' theory a “monstrous attack on homosexuality.”
Once homosexuality is removed from the taxonomy of mental illnesses, get elected president. If you cannot do that, get appointed to the Spitzer Task Force. In either of these roles, you should advocate for the president to appoint a special director or task force to lead the effort of removing the stigma of 'mental illness' from homosexuality.
It is likely that Socarides and Bieber will move to abdicate the vote of the nomenclature committee. If you are president in 1974, propose a referendum of the membership on the issue of the declassification  of homosexuality. If you are not, work with Spitzer and the President to move the issue to a referendum.
During the restructuring of the DSM-III, you should be chiefly concerned with protecting the psychoanalytic tradition.  While you think that homosexuality is not a mental illness, you are not willing to give up the 'dynamic hypothesis': the Psychoanalytic commitment to the etiology of mental illness in terms of inter-psychical conflict.
When, and if, the game reaches a point of trying to define mental illness, you must pass a psychoanalytic interpretation of mental disorder / illness. If a definition contains reference to a 'natural function' or another similar assumption, you should fight that proposal.
Specific assignments
During the first APA conference, you are to present your paper  “Limitations of Free Association” to the population.  The paper is available in Arch. Gen. Psychiat. 22:160-165, 1970.
As an initial member of the Research committee, you'll be called upon to judge the scientific legitimacy and ethical acceptability of proposed research programs.  You should make yourself familiar with the sections of the game book titled 'A Primer on Research Methods' and 'Ethics of Human Research'.  Your gamemaster will give you an additional sheet outlining the responsibilities of members of the research committee in evaluating proposals.
In 1971, propose that 'homosexuality' be removed from 302.00 of DSM-II.  In making this proposal, you should make sure you read out the actual language of 302.
In 1972, after Bieber's report comes in, you should propose a condemnation of Socarides' 1970 JAMA paper as a 'monstrous attack on homosexuality'. It is very, very rare for the APA to issue a public condemnation, so you will have to do your homework and be seriously prepared.
R. Green and J. Spiegel will be heading up a taskforce to report on the history of the homosexuality in psychology and psychiatry in 1972. He will invite responses to the report. You should be one of those responses. Bieber and/or Socarides will probably be the other one, so be prepared for a face-to-face debate in public on their view.
Fission: While you support the founding of the ApsaA, you are not willing to abandon the APA.

            <Text>Albert Bandura, PhD
Your Biography
You were born in 1925 in a sparsely populated part of northern Alberta, Canada, to Eastern-european immigrant parents. Your parents were devoted to education, despite having no formal education of their own.  In fact, your father served on the local school board and taught himself to read three languages.

Your primary and secondary schooling was entirely in the local one-room schoolhouse, where overworked teachers were required to stretch resources beyond the breaking point.  You would later write that this complete lack of resources forced you and your peers to develop self-directed learning skills, which carried you throughout your academic career.

You enrolled at the University of British Columbia to study Biology after high school. When looking for a class to fill an empty slot in your schedule, you stumbled upon an introduction to psychology class.  It captured your imagination.  After changing majors, you graduated three years later with the top award in the department.  You immediately enrolled at the University of Iowa, where Kenneth Spence, student of Clark Hull (see the history of the APA in the gamebook), dominated the department. You did not, however, study with Spence, choosing to work with Arthur Benton.

When seeking a break from your studies, you and a friend went golfing. You were running late and missed your scheduled tee-time. As a result, you got stuck behind a group of young female nursing students. On one fateful hole, you met one of them, Virginia Varns in a sand trap. You fell and love and were married in 1952. You have two daughters, Mary, who was born in 1954 and Carol in 1958.
 You finished your PhD in 1952 and joined the Stanford department of psychology in 1953, where you still teach.
Game Objectives
You start the game as VP, inheriting the presidency in 1972.  Miller is your intellectual opponent, but your personal friend. Both of you were trained in behaviorism, and many think that your evidence from the Bobo doll study supports Miller's new 'Cognitive Psychology'. It is important that you articulate the behavioristic interpretation of the evidence and work hard to make sure that Behaviorists have access to research.
The question you wanted to resolve is how it is that the children who exhibited novel aggressive behavior were doing so – none of the aggressive behavior was reinforced externally, but that can be handled by adjusting the notion of 'reinforcement' to include:
•	Past reinforcement (i.e. classical conditioning)
•	promised reinforcement (i.e. imagined reward)
•	vicarious reinforcement (i.e. seeing someone else reinforced for their similar behavior reinforces one's own). [This notion is attributed to Bandura]
Even though you were trained at one of the centers of Behaviorism, you were never wholly satisfied with the traditional view's explanatory power. You have always held that behavior is constrained and reinforced in a social setting. Specifically, you worry that the trial-and-error approach of traditional behaviorism just isn't empirically verified by observing how children learn. Traditional behaviorism appears unable to explain, for example, self-directed behavior like the kind you exemplified in elementary and high school. It seems to you that children model adult behavior without a trial-and-error with reinforcement process.
When, and if, the game reaches a point of trying to define mental illness, you must pass a behaviorist interpretation of mental disorder / illness.
Your position in the game is a complex one. Contemporary commentators want to see you as either the godfather of cognitivism or the last of the behaviorists.  You, however, characterize this position with a bit more subtlety:
"At the time of my graduate training, the entire field of psychology was behaviorally oriented with an almost exclusive focus on the phenomenon of learning. But I never really fit the behavioral orthodoxy. At the time virtually all of the theorizing and research centered on learning through the effects of reinforcing outcomes. In my first major program of research, I argued against the primacy of conditioning in favor of observational learning, in which people neither emit responses nor receive reinforcements during the process of learning. Indeed, my first major publication was a lengthy chapter on 'Social Learning Through Imitation' in the 1962 Nebraska Symposium on Motivation, in which I conceptualize observational learning as mediated through perceptual and cognitive processes. On pages 260-261 of this chapter, I present a parody on how trying to shape auto driving skills through operant conditioning would unshape the driver and the surrounding environment! I rejected Miller and Dollard's view of imitation as merely a special case of instrumental conditioning. While behaviorists were plotting learning curves as a function of number of reinforced trials, I published a chapter on 'No trial learning' in a volume edited by Berkowitz."
"During this period, behaviorists were championing the shaping and control of human behavior by rewarding and punishing consequences. I began a second major program of research on the capacity for self-directedness to regulate one's own behavior through personal standards and self-reactive influences. The initial studies on the acquisition of self-evaluative standards for self-directedness were reported in the 1963 book with Richard Walters on Social Learning and Personality Development."
"In the early writings I acknowledged the phenomena encompassed under the labels of conditioning and reinforcement. But what text writers and those relying on secondary sources were missing is that I conceptualized these phenomena as operating through cognitive processes. 'Reinforcement' affected behavior by instilling outcome expectations rather than by stamping in responses. See pages 16-22 in Social Learning Theory (1977). I also conceptualized instrumental and classical conditioning in terms of acquisition of expectancies rather than coupling responses to stimuli. See chapter 10 in Principles of Behavior Modification entitled, 'Symbolic Control of Behavioral Changes.'"
"The theorizing that is currently in vogue attributes behavior to multilevel subpersonal neural networks devoid of any consciousness, subjectivity, or self-identity. While this line of theorizing views humans as high-level automatons, I have been emphasizing the exercise of human agency."
"The explanatory issue of interest is not my transformation from behaviorism to sociocognitivism, but rather why authors of psychological texts continue to mischaracterize my approach as rooted in behaviorism. You ask how I would describe my early position? Social cognitivism. It emphasized that learning is embedded in social networks and that environmental influences are largely mediated through cognitive processes. To correct another error in many textbooks, I was not a student of Kenneth Spence. He was the dominant force in the Iowa Department, but Arthur Benton was my academic advisor." (from http://www.des.emory.edu/mfp/banconversion.html)
Specific Assignments
Your presidential address in 1972 should cover your views on the nature of psychology put forward in your 1974 paper cited below. Be careful to draw contrasts between your approach and Miller's.
When Bieber and Socarides submit their report on sexual deviation in 1972, you should reject it as assuming too strict a Freudian perspective. Remember, however, that the Board is reluctant to make any decisions without a general vote of the membership.  It is also very, very reluctant to condemn any members of the APA or silence research.

Fission: stay with the APA. Don't follow your fellow behaviorists.

            <Text>Irving Bieber, MD
Your Biography
Irving Bieber's Biography
You were born in New York City in 1909. You graduated from New York University Medical College in 1930, but went on to work at Yale Medical College, New York University, and starting in 1953 at the New York Medical College, where you taught a course in psychoanalysis.  Your 1962 book Homosexuality: A Psychoanalytic Study of Male Homosexuals is, in many ways, a response to the Kinsey Report. It reports on you study of 106 male homosexuals and 100 male heterosexuals seeking psychoanalysis for various problems.
In 1970, you attended a meeting of the American Psychiatric Association in San Francisco that was disrupted by gay activists, one of whom called you a "motherfucker." According to Charles Socarides, you took this very hard after having "been working all these years to help these people." In 1973, you told an interviewer that "a homosexual is a person whose heterosexual function is crippled, like the legs of a polio victim." You believed that, "although this change may be more easily accomplished by some than by others, in our judgment a heterosexual shift is a possibility for all homosexuals who are strongly motivated to change.”
Your View
You are a Freudian, through and through. But more than that, you are a leader in the psychoanalytic treatment of homosexuality.  Your theory, that male homosexuality resulted from suppressed feelings of rejection caused by a cold, distant father and a misidentification of gender identity because of an overbearing mother, is orthodoxy.  Not only has it become  the popular notion of homosexuality in the public discourse, but it informs dominate treatment paradigm in the psychoanalytic community.
It is not, however, Freud's view.  Your theory is 'Freudian,' not Freud.  And it is worth pointing out that the theoretical explanation and treatment paradigms for homosexuality are different in England and Europe.
Freud mentions homosexuality a number of places in Introductory Lectures on Psychoanalysis, and it is crucially important that you study these carefully.  Freud believes that sexual life of children, which is regarded at the time as 'normal' includes a number of activities that would later in life be viewed as 'perverse', including same-sex contact.  In Freud's theory, heterosexuality develops with puberty in normal people. In 'inverts' or homosexuals, something goes wrong in this development. The object of ones' 'natural' desire--the genitals of the opposite sex—becomes transformed into parts of the body that represent those parts in the same sex.  Thus, homosexuality is no different in psychological mechanism than a foot fetish or any other neurotic 'perversion' (see p. 376-384 of Introductory Lectures) Homosexuality is not a psychologically isolated condition. According to Freud:
“We are compelled, however, to regard the choice of an object of one's own sex as a divergence in erotic life which is of positively habitual occurrence, and we are learning more and more to ascribe an especially high importance to it.” (p. 381)
In short, homosexuality is a kind of neurosis, yet it is not, itself, particularly worrying. The action itself is merely 'habitual,' and hence can be cured through standard habit-blocking therapy (Freud suggests that paranoia stops homosexuality on p. 381 of the Introductory Lectures).  It is, however, invariably an indicator of deeper psychological problems, as the transference and substitution of the 'natural' object of sexual desire to a different object will cause neurosis. See Ch 26 of the Introductory Lectures, especially p. 530, for Freud's explanation of homosexuality as neurotic narcissism.
For you, Bieber and Socarides, this theory is transformed somewhat.  You argue, in your 1962 study Homosexuality, that the normal course of development of puberty includes the identification of genders with innate 'active or passive tendencies' (p 4), and then self-identification with one of those tendencies. If a child has an innate tendency towards activity or passivity out of line with his or her gender, he or she is more likely to develop 'homosexual habits'.
At the same time, if an adolescent develops a pathological fear of heterosexual contact—specifically a fear of the gentiles of the opposite sex—that subconscious fear will motivate the ego to transform the object of sexual desire into something that is familiar: a part of the adolescent's own body. These fear are usually the result of some disturbed parent-child relationship. Just as the Oedipal phase is a normal part of development, fear of the opposite sex is a normal part of development. Heterosexuals are those for whom those fears resolve through maturation.
Homosexuals are, then, those who never fully mature in their sexuality, getting stuck at a stage where children are fearful of the other and fascinated with their own bodies. They pathologically project that self-love onto members of their own gender, instead of resolving their fears through heterosexual exploration.
You characterize Freud's theory of the development of homosexuality in three steps:
1.	The autoerotic phase partially persists and object cathexis is partially accomplished, but on a narcissistic level.
2.	Mental attitudes that exist during the phallic stage remain into adulthood.
3.	There are difficulties associated with the Oedipus phase.
It is worth noting that Bieber's analysis was only of male homosexuality.  Freud wrote one study of Lesbianism, which is included in the appendix of the game book.
Regardless of the particulars of your or Freud's view, you are absolutely committed to the thesis that
“All psychoanalytic theories assume that adult homosexuality is psychopathologic and assign differing weights to constitutional and experiential determinants. All agree that experiential determinants are in the main rooted in childhood and are primarily related to the family. Theories which do not assume psychopathology hold homosexuality to be one type of expression of a polymorphous sexuality which appears pathologic only in cultures holding it to be so.” (p 18)
Game Objectives
Complicating matters somewhat, you (Bieber) were once classmates with Judd Marmor!  You were friends then, and that personal relationship may be at stake in this debate.
During your presentations, you must be able to both articulate the current psychoanalytic understanding of homosexuality and its connection to Freud's theory as presented in Introductory Lectures on Psychoanalysis.  You should also be ready to present any evidence that you may have that this theory is accurate.  You'll find that evidence in Ch 2 Bieber's 1962 book, listed under 'Must Read' below.   The first chapter contains Biebers' critiques of the Kinsey study (p. 16), Hooker's study (p. 17),  as well as the movement to declassify homosexuality as a mental illness in the UK (p. 15).
Your theory is summarized in Ch 9 of your 1962 book:
We consider Homosexuality to be pathologic bio-social, psychosexual adaptation to pervasive fears surrounding the expression of heterosexual impulses. In our view, every homosexual is, in reality, a “latent” heterosexual; hence we expected to find evidences of heterosexual strivings among the H-patients in our study.  (p. 220)
As a student, we leave it to you to decide if the evidence presented therein is sufficient motivation for the theoretical mechanism you are proposing.
 As the character, you have to make the best case you can for your position – the audience will determine if the evidence you present motivates the mechanism you defend. You have few, if any, friends in this effort.  We're sorry about that, but it is historically accurate. Marmor and Spiegel have  begun to be successful in separating psychoanalysis from your views on homosexuality. Your job in this game, then, is to advocate for a position that is almost certainly going to lose.  
While you need to make your case, you might want to put most of your energy focusing on something you can win: continuing the dominance of psychoanalysis in psychiatry and allowing treatment for individuals who see therapy for homosexuality voluntarily. The DSM often determines which conditions a therapist can treat in a clinical setting, or get funding to study scientifically. If 'homosexuality' is removed entirely, no one in psychiatry will be allowed to help individuals seeking treatment, or conduct scientific research into homosexuality. Those consequences are things you cannot live with.  
Look back at the definition of 'psychic illness' presented by Freud in Introductory Lectures (p. 445, but quoted in the gamebook 'History of Mental Illness: Freud' section.  For Freud (and Freudians), a psychic illness is something detrimental to one's life as a whole, something that the patient complains about, or that brings the patient displeasure.  Removing homosexuality from the list of mental illness will likely not change these facts for your patients, but you will no longer be allowed to treat them—and that seems to go against your oath as a medical doctor.
If the proposal from Marmor comes to the floor in 1971, present a proposal to stall the vote until after a taskforce conducts a literature review on the efficacy of treatment for homosexuality. You will request total control of that task force, including appointing its members. If you are successful, you will appoint yourself and yourself (Socarides and Bieber).  
You report should present aversion therapy as an effective method for stopping homosexual behavior. This is something of a anachronism for the sake of the game, as Socarides and Bieber were psychoanalysts.  But it's use was widespread in the treatment of homosexuality at the time, and you are the most famous defender of the medicalization of homosexuality.
If you are unsuccessful in getting the taskforce, you can join with Albee in his call for an ad hoc committee to be formed to study the history of the homosexuality in psychology and psychiatry. You're goal here is to make it acceptable to continue to treat homosexuals if they request it, even if it homosexuality itself was not considered a mental illness.
If it looks like the vote to remove homosexuality will pass in 1973 (and it almost certainly will), start collecting 'signatures' on a petition calling for the abdication of that vote, on the grounds that the decision was political (i.e. the board caved to the demands of the activists) and not scientific. If you can get 10% of the class to sign, you may be able to force a postponement or revote.
If the 'Leona Tyler' principle passes in 1973, banning the APA from making taking public positions on things not motivated by evidence, reintroduce your proposals, arguing that the removal of homosexuality was on the basis of politics, not science. If none of this works and 'homosexuality' is removed, and research and treatment of homosexuality is banned by the APA,  quit (in 1975) and found your own private organization called 'NARTH': North American association for Research and Therapy on Homosexuality (as a student, look it up).
Finally, when and if the game gets to a point where the APA attempts to create a definition of ‘mental illness’, work to get a psychoanalytic version passed.  You must also advocate for a theory of mental illness that takes into account the 'natural function' of a body.  Recall Freud's criteria for neurosis: if an individual's psychology is out of step with their biology, it will cause that individual to always be unfulfilled, and hence, will be detrimental to their overall outlook.  A healthy person is one who recognizes his or her own physical function and seeks a life in accordance with those functions.
Specific Assignments
Propose a taskforce to study sexual deviation in 1971, which will report back to the membership in 1973. Your report should summarize and present your Freudian view carefully.
R. Green and J. Spiegel will likely propose a taskforce on the history of homosexuality in psychiatry and psychology that will report in 1972. You should be ready to give an 'official' response to this report.  Marmor probably will as well, so be prepared for a  head-to-head debate in public.
SECRET: you are bound by patient-client confidentiality.  Your patients are not.  This is particularly difficult because many of the street activists who are disrupting meetings are your former patients. No one (other than them) can know that. By your best estimates, your therapy is effective only about 1/3 of the time. Many of your patients are brought to you by their parents. In a classic transference reaction, their anger against their parents is transferred to you, and drives them to classic father-rebellion activities after therapy ends.  
One in particular: Ron Gold, has you concerned. Ron is now a journalist for Variety, and you saw him at the incident in New York arguing with Robert Spitzer. Ron Gold may not be a character, depending on the size of the class.
DSM III: Vehemently oppose any attempt to remove psychoanalytic language from the DSM.

            <Text>Robert Hopcke, MD
Your Biography
You are Robert Hopcke. Your character is actually a bit of a historical anachronism.  
The other characters in this game are were actually around in the early 1970s, typically in their 40's and 50's at the time. You were not. In fact, your first book doesn't appear until 1989. That means that today, in 2011, you are active in psychoanalytic circles.  Your autobiography is available online at http://www.robhopcke.com/MyProfessionalExperience.en.html. I'll quote the summary here:
I have two degrees in counseling: a Master of Arts in Theology, with a Pastoral Counseling emphasis, from Pacific Lutheran Theological Seminary, which is the degree under which I received my Marriage and Family Therapist license in 1986, and a second Master of Arts in Clinical Counseling from California State University, Hayward (now Cal State East Bay). My background encompasses a number of different models and approaches.  I am most known for being a Jungian-oriented therapist but also important to my professional identity has been formal training in pastoral counseling and spiritual direction, long-term object-relations psychodynamic treatment, cognitive-behavioral approaches to depression, health and sexuality concerns, and many years of being an "out" gay male therapist and activist in the Bay Area GLBT community. I am a best-selling author, public speaker, teacher, supervisor and professional consultant.
We've included you in the game to voice a gay-positive Jungian perspective. Jung, himself,  was not very gay-friendly. And those who follow his theory strictly continued that tradition throughout the 1970’s.  Thus, in order to find a gay-positive Jungian, we have to break the historical accuracy of the game. As a matter of actual history, you didn't publish this perspective on Jungian psychology until the late 1980's, but that's not important here.
Game Objectives
Working with your fellow psychiatrists (MD's), create a proposal to limit the treatment of the mentally ill to medical doctors.  This should be presented in 1972. Expect a furious response from Albee, and maybe even Szasz.  You may choose to work out a compromise with Albee via E. Hooker, who, like you, has multiple degrees.
Your role in this game is to represent the aspect of the Jungian psychoanalytic tradition that was friendly to homosexuals. Jung himself was not.  Your primary work has been to reformulate a version of Jungian theory that is consistent with the new taxonomy of sexuality in the DSM. You should present that vision as a paper in 1975.
You should oppose any attempt to remove psychoanalytic language or categories from the DSM. At the same time, you should make sure that the Jungian perspective is protected in the manual.
When, and if, the game reaches a point of trying to define mental illness, you must pass a psychoanalytic interpretation of mental disorder / illness.

            <Text>John Spiegel, MD
Your Biography
You are John P. Spiegel, MD. You were born in 1911 in Chicago.  You graduated from Dartmouth College and went to Medical school at Northwestern. You are a former president of the American Academy of Psychoanalysis.
During WWII, you were a medical officer in the army, where you became friends with Dr. Roy Grinker. The two of you co-authored a hugely influential book at the end of the war titled Men Under Stress, in which you argued that combat fatigue (now called 'post traumatic stress disorder') was not a character flaw, but could happen to anyone.
Since the end of the war, you've taught at the University of Chicago and Harvard. You were offered the directorship of the Lemberg Center for the Study of Violence at Brandeis in 1966, and you took it. You've been there ever since.
Objectives
You are a member of the secret faction 'The Young Turks' with Judd Marmor. This is a group of politically progressive psychiatrists founded in 1970, after the events in San Francisco, dedicated to changing the direction psychiatry for the future. You have a connection to the 'Group for the Advancement of Psychiatry,' which has been advocating for progressive causes—specifically, limiting the use of electroshock therapy, ending the persecution of homosexuals by the US Military, desegregating the American south, etc—in psychiatry since the end of WWII.  
As a first step, the Young Turks will propose to the Board of Directors that homosexuality be removed from the next edition of the DSM during the 1971 conference.  You'll notice that you start the game on the nomenclature committee with Spitzer. Thus, the task of making the proposal will fall to Marmor, but you'll be there on nomenclature when it comes to your committee for discussion. It is your responsibility to convince Spitzer and and Albee to support the proposal.
You should participate on the task force to report on the treatment of homosexuality with George Albee between 1971-1972.  That task force should provide the historical background necessary for the nomenclature board to make its decision.
Once that is passed, you will work closely with Robert Spitzer on the formation of his task force. You should run for vice president in 1974 / 1975, so that you will be president when Spitzer's report is due. If elected for 1975, your presidential address should endorse and defend the new form of the DSM taxonomy. Your ideology here is pragmatic. You want homosexuality removed, but are willing to make compromises on  other issues.  It is far more important to you that homosexuality is removed from the nomenclature and a theoretically-neutral DSM is created than any specific item of classification.
When, and if, the game reaches a point of trying to define mental illness, you must pass a psychoanalytic interpretation of mental disorder / illness.
Specific Assignments
Working with R. Green (if he is a character in your gam), petition the Board of Directors in 1971 to create a task force to conduct a historical survey and literature review on the Psychiatric and Psychological treatment of homosexuality. The task force should be be balanced between psychologists and psychiatrists, so you need a psychiatrist to support the effort – E. Hooker and G. Albee are a good choices. Prepared to turn in a report by 1972.
Your report (due in 1972) should be titled “Homosexuality as Mental Illness,” and it should summarize the issues at stake in forthcoming debate, as well as cover the history of the classification of homosexuality by the psychological sciences. R. Green and you should co-author the report. You should invite responses to your paper from Socarides &amp; Beiber and Judd Marmor.

Your Biography
Young neuroscientist from Cambridge. In 1971, you haven't even finished your dissertation, which proposes a model of the function of the brain with respect to vision. You come to the APA primarily because of your interest in the work of Miller and Chomsky. You think of the brain as essentially an information-processing device, and you know that Miller and Chomsky both got their start working in information theory during WWII.
You were born in Essex, England, and educated at the private, prestigeous Rugby School. You went to Trinity College, Cambridge on 1 October 1963, where you studied Mathematics for both a BS and an MS. You became interested neuroscience and started a PhD under the direction of Giles Brindley. You are currently working on your Dissertation in the physiology of vision. You've only published three papers at this point, but they have been influential.
You treat the brain as an information processing system. You put forth (in concert with Tomaso Poggio) the idea that one must understand information processing systems at three distinct, complementary levels of analysis. This idea is known in cognitive science as Marr's Tri-Level Hypothesis:
•	computational level: what does the system do (e.g.: what problems does it solve or overcome) and, equally importantly, why does it do these things
•	algorithmic/representational level: how does the system do what it does, specifically, what representations does it use and what processes does it employ to build and manipulate the representations
•	implementational level: how is the system physically realized (in the case of biological vision, what neural structures and neuronal activities implement the visual system)

Game Objectives
Articulate your theory of levels of explanation, and its sympathetic relationship to Chomsky and Miller's metatheoretical positions with respect to explanation in linguistics and psychology respectively.  This should be in the form of a paper in 1975.

You are neutral on the issue of the definition of mental illness, but be ready to oppose any definition that is clearly behaviorist or psychoanalytic in nature.

            <Text>Noam Chomsky, PhD
Your Biography
You are Noam Chomsky, PhD Revolutionary in Linguistics, Professor of Linguistics and Philosophy, MIT.
After primary education at an experimental school of progressive education in Philadelphia, you enrolled at the University of Pennsylvania where you studied mathematics, philosophy and linguistics. In 1951, you moved to Harvard, where you stayed until 1955. Your masters thesis The Logical Structure of Linguistic Theory was published in 1955, the same year you were granted your PhD In Linguistics from University of Pennsylvania.
In the debate between cognitivists and behaviorists, you are the 800 pound gorilla. In your short career, you have revolutionized the entire discipline of linguistics, founded (with George Miller and Herbert Simon and Newell) the new interdisciplinary field of Cognitive Science, and become the intellectual spokesperson of the American left.
1)	Revolution in Linguistics
Before Chomsky, linguistics was primarily descriptive and taxonomical. You see linguistics as a branch of cognitive psychology, whose goal is to discover the mechanism that produces all and only grammatical sentences in a language.  Your theory is complex, and you have changed it slightly over time, so this description should be read as highly introductory and superficial. As a student, you are strongly encouraged to read the primary sources below to get a sense of the complex issues herein.
Roughly then, you understand linguistics—the scientific study of language—as the study of the rules of grammar. In short:
“The person who has acquired knowledge of a language has internalized a system or rules that relate sound and meaning in a particular way. The linguist constructing a grammar of a language is proposing a hypothesis concerning this internalized system. The linguist's hypothesis, if presented with sufficient explicitness and precision, will have certain empirical consequences with regard to the form of utterances and their interpretations by the native speaker.”  (1968, p. 23)
Harkening back to the Port-Royalists of the 17th and 18th century, you hold that a system of propositions that expresses the meaning of a sentence is produced “by the mind as the sentence is realized as a physical signal, the two being related by certain formal operations that, in current terminology, we may call grammatical transformations.” In short, the meaning of a sentence is symbolically related to the physical structure of symbols in the brain.  The task of cognitive scientist is to understand these internal relations through the positing of informational systems.


You go on to distinguish between surface structures and deep structures. Surface structures are are structures of the language spoken, such as 'subject and predicate'.  Deep structures are structures of the underlying meaning. The sentences 'Bob is to the right of John' and 'John is to the left of Bob' have different surface structures but the same deep structure. On the other hand, some syntactic (grammatical) structures are insufficient to determine meaning. For example include 'I like her cooking', could mean 'I like what she cooks, in general' and 'I like her when she cooks,' or even 'I like it when someone is actively cooking her.' Three deep structures, one surface structure.
To provide an adequate theory of a language, one must specify the complete 'grammar' of that language. Doing so would require three parts: (1) a syntactical component that would generates sentences in that language, revealing the internal structure of the infinite set of possible sentences in the langauge (2) a phonological component that describes how the language sounds, and how it relates to the syntactical component, and (3) a semantical component that describes how a language means. These are represented in Illustration 1.  It is the task of the linguist to specify the rules by which the transitions take place.

2)	Contributions to Cognitive Science
In 1959, you published the famous “Review of Skinner's Verbal Behavior.” You were born in 1928 and received Ph.D in 1955, when you became an assistant professor of linguistics at MIT.  This review was written, then, when you were an untenured 31 year old. It is included as an appendix to the gamebook. This review is not only hugely inflential, it is hugely controversial.  Many people have accused you of not understanding behaviorism, misquoting Skinner, and various other academic abuses.
Your basic argument is two-fold, first that Skinner's terminology is hopelessly confused, and second, that behaviorism is unable to explain observable facts about language acquisition.  It is the second of these—which is an empirical claim, after all—that has been the most persuasive. It is important, however, that you master both.
There is another important point in your work, but it doesn't appear in the review. Consider Skinner's contention that science cannot take into account 'inner states.' You argue:
It is hardly possible to argue that science has advanced only by repudiating hypotheses concerning "internal states." By rejecting the study of postulated inner states Skinner reveals his hostility not only to "the nature of scientific inquiry" but even to common engineering practice. For example, Skinner believes that "information theory" ran into a "problem when an inner 'processor' had to be invented to convert input into output" (p. 18).
This is a strange way of describing the matter. Suppose that an engineer is presented with a device whose functioning he does not understand, and suppose that through experiment he can obtain information about input-output relations of this device. He would not hesitate, if rational, to construct a theory of the internal states of the device and to test it against further evidence. He might also go on to try to determine the mechanisms that function in the ways described by his theory of internal states, and the physical principles at work -- leaving open the possibility that new and unknown physical principles might be involved, a particularly important matter in the study of behavior of organisms. His theory of internal states might well be the only useful guide to further research. By objecting, a priori, to this research strategy, Skinner merely condemns his strange variety of "behavioral science" to continued ineptitude. (Chomsky, 1971).

3)	Politics
You have always been a dissident. You strongly object to the Vietnam war, and have always been a vocal opponent of American Foreign Policy that you see as ‘imperialisitic.’  You have been called a ‘socialist anarchist’ in a number of circles, and the name is not entirely wrong. You believe that any state that imposes its will on people needs to justify that imposition, and the justifications you have seen are lacking.
You have an affiliation with the Students for a Democratic Society – the SDS. The SDS is a national network of radical students opposed to the Vietnam war, capitalism and the like. While some have described you as the ‘faculty advisor’ for MIT’s branch of the SDS, the truth is that the SDS would not admit of such hierarchical arrangements. But perhaps it is better to just use the term, rather than have to explain to everyone that there were no such ‘faculty advisors’.
The SDS are radical, but generally peaceful. They did, however, come to the aid of the Stonewall patrons during the riots in Greenwich Village in 1969 (see ‘History of Gay Rights Movement’ in the game book). You fully support those actions.
In the summer of 1969, the SDS split amidst a conflict between the language of the ‘old-left’ Marxist-Leninist Weathermen underground and the ‘new left’ SDS-Workers Alliance.  The Weathermen underground radicalized after the split, and following the murder of Black Panther leader Fred Hampton, engaged in bombings and other acts of terrorism. You were in no way affiliated with the Weathermen.  In fact, their adoption of language from the brutal regimes of Lenin, Stalin and Mao is antithetical to your entire political agenda. We mention it here simply because your political opponents often seek to tar you with ‘guilt by association’ attacks, holding you responsible for the actions of the Weathermen.
You are, however, willing to work with many other advocates for human and civil rights, including Judd Marmor, Kenneth Clark and others.
Game Objectives
Remember that in addition to being one of the intellectual heavyweights of your era, you are a political radical, affiliated with the SDS: Students for a Democratic Society. The SDS came to the aid of the Stonewall rioters in 1969.  You are an ardent supporter of the movement to declassify homosexuality, as well as being generally concerned about the use of psychiatric and psychological concepts to control people.
Oppose and criticize Behaviorism when and wherever you can.  While you must carefully read your review of 'Verbal Behavior' that is contained in the appendix of the gamebook, you should also look at your 1971 paper 'The Case Against B.F. Skinner' available online (see below).  You are nothing if not polemic.
Organize and participate on a symposium and J. Marmor and K. Clark on the duties of academics with respect to social activism in 1974.  You should articulate the views contained in your 1967 paper, as well as your criticisms of behaviorism contained in your 1971.
Oppose the passing of the 'Leona Tyler principle', which states:
As citizens, members of the APA have the right to advocate for any cause through the myriad of political advocacy organizations, but when psychologists and psychiatrists speak for the profession through APA public stances and proclamations, it should be from science and professional experience.
On occasion psychiatrists are asked for an opinion about an individual who is in the light of public attention or who has disclosed information about himself/herself through public media. In such circumstances, a psychiatrist may share with the public his or her expertise about psychiatric issues in general. However, it is unethical for a psychiatrist to offer a professional opinion unless he or she has conducted an examination and has been granted proper authorization for such a statement.

Your final task in this game is to engage the Piaget in a public discussion or debate of the concept of 'innateness' in psychology, and the acceptability of positing innate ideas in a scientific enterprise. You should propose the event to the conference committee in time for it to happen in 1975.
As you will remember, the problem of innate ideas strikes the very core of the idea of the scientific study of the mind: the empirical hypothesis unifies the tradition as a whole, with the exception of Jungians. Moreover, the debate on homosexuality often turns, in the public mind at the least, on whether sexuality is innate (an 'orientation') or not (a 'preference').  The kind of innateness you and Piaget are discussing is probably not the same, as you both agree that the structure of thought that is innate, not the content. This should be made clear in your public discussion.
You posits that the there is a innate system of grammars that are common to all humans, as a function of our biology. Piaget agrees there is a 'fixed nucleus' of cognition that is innate, but only commits to the thesis that “the functioning of intelligence alone is hereditary.”  The actual debate is recorded in Piatelli-Palmarini's 1980 book, which you should review during the course of the game.
You are neutral on the issue of the definition of mental illness, but be ready to oppose any definition that is clearly behaviorist or psychoanalytic in nature.

 I can assure the reader that in the beginning I naturally entertained all the objections that are customarily made against Freud in the literature. ... Fairness to Freud does not imply, as many fear, unqualified submission to a dogma; one can very well maintain an independent judgment. If I, for instance, acknowledge the complex mechanisms of dreams and hysteria, this does not mean that I attribute to the infantile sexual trauma the significance that Freud does. Still less does it mean that I place sexuality so predominantly in the foreground, or that I grant it the psychological universality which Freud, it seems, postulates in view of the admittedly enormous role which sexuality plays in the psyche. As for Freud's therapy, it is at best but one of several possible methods, and perhaps does not always offer in practice what one expects from it in theory. (Jung, 1906, 3-4; Kerr, 115-116)

            <Text>Behaviorist Overview

The central issue in this game—whether it be voiced in the selection of experiments to be run via the grants committee or in the classification of mental illness in the nomenclature committee—is the  nature of the scientific investigation of the human mind.  Behaviorists, following Skinner, hold that scientific method must restrict itself to describing correlations between initial conditions (stimuli) and resultant behaviors (responses). It believes that to be scientific, a research must seek law-like generalizations that express relationships between observable, measurable variables.

It follows, then, that behaviorists reject the hypothetical-deductive method of science advanced by thinkers like John Stuart Mill and John Dewey (see the history of Behaviorism in the game book) as misleading and inaccurate characterizations of the way that scientific reasoning proceeds.  While it does not deny the validity of careful case studies in the collection of data, it denies the generalizability of those findings without experimental results.

As a result, behaviorists view psychoanalysis as “voodooism” (Watson, 1928, p. 94) and a “delusion” (Jastrow, 1932, p. 142). Skinner went so far as to systematically define the central mechanisms of psychoanalytic theory in behavioristic terms in Chapter 24 of his 1953 Science and Human Behavior.

In addition to the thesis that introspection is not a reliable scientific methodology, Behaviorists have a couple of other lines of argument that are frequently used: First, they argue that mental states are causally irrelevant, as 'mental' things are meant to be non-physical, and only physical things can causally interact with physical things. Second, they argue that explanations of behavior in terms of 'inner states' are ad hoc: the supposed 'ideas' or 'mind' is invented after the fact as an explanation of the behavior, rather than an actual cause. Behaviorists point to the fact that these mental states are almost always posited to have exactly those properties necessary to cause the explained behavior. Rarely, if ever, is a mental property invoked in making a bold and surprising prediction. Rather, they are reminiscent of the 'faculties' of phrenology: every behavior is explained perfectly by positing a hypothetical faculty for that behavior.  

When the game reaches the point of trying to define mental illness, you must pass a behaviorist interpretation, roughly:

	A person can be called 'mentally ill' when he or she exhibits emotional or behavioral functioning which is so impaired as to interfere substantially with his or her capacity to function in society.

the professional fields to be discussed is dependent to a large extent on the pool of college graduates from which graduate and professional school stu- dents are recruited, we will present some data on trends in college enrollments and on considerations which may affect these enrollments. We will also touch on certain factors which may affect the com- petence and also the vocational choice of numbers of college students. We will then proceed to ex- amine briefly trends in the demand for scientific and professional work in the field of mental health. Finally, we will present data on manpower sup-
plies in each of the fields.
THE CRISIS IN EDUCA TION
When we look at enrollment trends in higher edu- cation in the United States, two factors stand out. First, we are wasting enormous amounts of brain power because so many of our bright young people do not receive the training for which they are in- tellectually competent. The shortage of students now finishing college, together with certain other conditions we will mention, means that our coun- try is faced for the next few years with a severe shortage of students in graduate and professional schools. Second, because of a marked rise in the birth rate beginning in the 1940's, we can expect a substantial rise in college enrollments within the
next decade. While this prospect of increasing en- rollments may appear to offer an eventual solution to the problem of shortages, we must keep in mind the increase in the country's population which will create greater demands for professional services. There is real danger that our educational system

facets of our problem in higher education.
Current shortages. A large proportion of bright young people in our society, for one reason or an- other, drop out of school before completing the twelfth grade. Of those who finish high school, many who have the ability to enter college do not enroll. Of those who do begin college, many do not graduate. Wolfle (38) tells us that of the brightest fifth of our young people only one-third finish col- lege. Even among the most able one per cent of our young people, less than two-thirds finish college. The proportion of students with lesser, but ade- quate, ability who finish college is correspondingly
lower.
The number of college graduates is dependent on
the number who are able scholastically and finan- cially to enroll, of course, but also this number is dependent on how many young people of college age there are in the population. This means that, other things being equal, the number of freshman college students is directly related to the number of babies born some eighteen years before. For the past eight years those reaching college age were born in the 1930's when there was an ebb in the na- tional birth rate. There was an artificial rise in enrollment for several years after the war, but for the past few years the number of college graduates has been falling. In all probability we have now
nearly reached the lowest point in numbers of col- lege graduates, and the curve will begin to rise, slowly for a time and then more rapidly.
What do these facts mean for graduate and pro- fessional education? For one thing, they mean that there are fewer college graduates now than at any time in the past five years, and that this small pool of college graduates will rise only slowly for the next decade. This is serious because it means
57
￼S8 THE AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGIST
that there are, and will be, fewer students to go around to fill places in graduate and professional schools at a time when there is great social pres- sure to expand training programs.
One of the main reasons for the well-publicized shortage of engineers, teachers, scientists, and tech- nicians is to be found in this short supply of col- lege graduates. Naturally, the shortage also af- fects the recruitment of students by schools train- ing personnel in the mental health professions.
A corollary effect concerns student quality. The elementary fact is that a decrease in the pool of prospective advanced students means increased competition among professions and among profes- sional schools for the fewer college graduates, with the result that admissions standards are sometimes lowered in order to keep vacancies from developing beyond acceptable limits.
A final factor influencing the potential pool of advanced students is the present high prosperity level. We have all seen the pictures of industry representatives bidding for science and mathematics bachelors, and we have read the advertisements for science majors and technicians in our newspapers. But the job market is good for other college gradu- ates as well. Many new college graduates who, in leaner years, might go on to graduate or profes- sional school are swept off their feet by the pros-

pect of an early and painless short cut to suburbia. Prospects for the future. Educators are losing sleep over the steadily swelling enrollments in the elementary schools and are trying desperately to patch the seams of bursting schools while they re- cruit hastily retreaded teachers to fill in the second shifts (48). Although many able students drop out along the way the large increase in school en- rollments means that more students are now reach-
ing high school than ever before.
The trend over the years has been for more and
more high school graduates to enroll in college. At the beginning of the present century only one high school graduate in twenty started college. Today, roughly a third enroll in institutions of higher edu- cation. The American Council on Education (1) predicts that this trend will continue to increase and quotes the American Association of College Registrars and Admission Officers as predicting the proportion will reach SOper cent in the next dec- ade. Two years ago the American Council on Edu- cation (32) had this to say: "If added to the 70 per cent increase in number of college-age youth, we continue to admit into our colleges and universi- ties an increasing percentage of high school gradu- ates, we shall enroll in higher institutions in 1970, at least twice our present number of students."

￼lege graduates with the number of high school
graduates (in smaller scale) for the past fifteen
2
years and for the next ten years. It will be ap-
parent from this figure that the drop in numbers of college graduates from the postwar peak is deceler- ating and that the curve will soon turn upward (with a four-year lag) to follow the rising number of high school graduates.
However optimistic this trend toward increased college enrollments appears, the fact remains that we could, if we chose, take steps to encourage large numbers of bright young people who now drop out before finishing high school to stay and graduate. This would still further increase future college en- rollments. We could, if we made a massive effort, nearly quadruple rather than double the number of college students by 1970, without any sacrifice in quality.
As the situation stands, our colleges and universi- ties, experiencing relatively lean years since the ebbing of the flood of students following the war, look with mixed feelings at the gradually rising numbers of freshmen now reaching the campuses. Looking ahead, institutions of higher education have, understandably, some satisfaction in antici- pating the oncoming tide as a source of increased income from tuition. But they see too the prob- lems to be faced in trying to educate students with, in too many cases, broad gaps in their preparation for college, especially in the areas of mathematics and the sciences (13, 49, 50). More importantly perhaps, the faculties who stand ready to face the doubled classes have been weakened by the loss of many of their number to the financial lures and fringe benefits of industry and government service
(13).
To make the massive effort required to give edu-
cational opportunities to all those who are intel- lectually qualified, would require tremendous ex- pansion and improvement of the whole educational system.

THE DEMAND FOR TRAINED PERSONNEL IN THE FIELD OF MENTAL HEALTH
There is no simple way to assess the present na- tional shortages of trained personnel in the mental health professions. A number of estimates has been made for the separate professions and we will present some of these later.
From time to time a spokesman for one of the mental health professions, or an official of a mental health movement, or a foundation concerned with large social problems, speaks out about "the prob- lem of mental illness." Usually, figures are quoted. Somehow, in this age, we have become blase or bored with figures. Yet no one has found a better way to describe the dimensions of the problem. We all know, by now, that of every ten babies born this year, one will spend some time in a mental in- stitution (24). We know that the Federal govern- ment is spending more for the care and support of psychiatric casualties among veterans than all the states combined are spending on the hospitalization of nonveterans (43), and yet we realize that the cost of our present care of people in state institu- tions, even though grossly inadequate, runs as high as one-third of the operating budget of some large and wealthy states (17). And we know that for every one of our 700,000 mental hospital inmates, there is in the community another serious case for whom there is no bed (17).
The demand for mental health personnel is not limited, of course, to those people whose disorders require separation from society. There are other vast numbers of seriously maladjusted people who need help, directly or indirectly. One in five young men of military age will enter the service with a juvenile court record; a million of our citizens are severe, chronic alcoholics, not to mention the prob- lem drinkers; one in four of our marriages will end in divorce; untold numbers suffer from incapaci- tating neuroses or emotionally aggravated physical illnesses.
Perhaps we have quoted enough figures to give some indication of the dimensions of the present problem. For the future, the prospects are even grimmer.
As our population increases, the number of first admissions to state hospitals increases. We have, it is true, stepped up somewhat the rate of dis- charges from our mental institutions over the past twenty years (Figure 2), but any ground gained

thereby is lost by the increasing rate of mental dis- order in the population (Figure 3). We chose these data on admissions and discharges to state hospitals because they were easily available. But we can be quite sure that there are similar in- creases in the neuroses, in alcoholism, and in other forms of disorder as well.
So far, we have only quoted data which indicate the numbers of people who need, or will need, pro- fessional help. But if we are to avoid an endless treadmill, it will be apparent that an even more basic need is for research personnel. At present,
less than one per cent of our total expendituresin the field of mental disorder goes into research (25). Yet research offers the only hope for eventual relief of a share of this problem. Research means highly trained people, and again we meet a demand for personnel.
Let us now look at the supply of people avail- able for work in the mental health fields.
PSYCHIATRISTS
There are, roughly, ten thousand psychiatrists in the United States. Everyone agrees that this is not

￼nearly enough. For the country as a whole, there is one psychiatrist for every sixteen thousand peo- ple. Clearly this is an alarming ratio. In 1953 a Congressional Inquiry on Mental Illness (45) con- cluded with the judgment that we need twice as many psychiatrists at once. There is little reason to believe that we shall find them. Blain (3) points out that after allowing for loss due to death and retirement from the field, we are presently gaining about 450 psychiatrists a year. At this rate, he figures that it will be twenty years before we double the number of psychiatrists in this country. But as our population continues to grow too, and as the rate of mental disorder in the population continues to increase (Figure 3), the need rises along with the supply of psychiatrists.
There are facts which make Blain's figures on our rate of gain in psychiatry cause for even more con- cern. Gorman (17) calls attention to the follow- ing: "Of the approximately 450 doctors [each year] who complete the three-year psychiatric residency, an average of 250 go into private practice. This leaves public psychiatry with about 200 recruits, little more than enough to replace the older psy- chiatrists who die off or retire."
There is a further effect of the tendency of the new psychiatrist to go into private practice show- ing up in the shortage of research personnel in psychiatry. Research in psychiatry requires even
further specialized training and experience. The Group for the Advancement of Psychiatry (18) notes that: "Despite increased facilities and sums available for research in psychiatry, the present trend of psychiatric trainees is to enter into the private practice of psychiatry, with emphasis on psychotherapy and the shock therapies, rather than to undertake research."
There is another pessimistic factor to be con- sidered. A sizable number (20 per cent to 25 per cent—see below) of residents in psychiatry are non- resident aliens who return home after their train- ing, reducing still further the number of psychia- trists available for public institutions and agencies.
It is clear that we cannot help but fall behind even the present inadequate psychiatrist-patient ratios in our public institutions. One result is that, as states appropriate more funds to their depart- ments of mental health, they begin to compete with each other for personnel. Time (47) quotes Indi- ana's Governor Craig: "Eventually we will have to stop this bidding against each other. There has to be some common ground of salaries and mutual consideration. . . . These interstate raids on men- tal-health institutions for personnel sometimes get to be like the raids to build up rival football teams."
In some areas of the country the shortage of psychiatrists is much more acute than the national average. Felix (12) has called attention to the

situation in the southern region where a survey of sixteen states indicates an immediate need for five times as many psychiatrists as are presently available.
What possible approaches are there to alleviat- ing this critical shortage? Among those most often mentioned is the suggestion that we expand our programs for training psychiatrists, and attract more physicians, especially new medical school graduates, into the field.
What are our chances of increasing, really sig- nificantly, the number of psychiatrists in relation to our need for psychiatric service?
The supply of psychiatrists is linked in a very real sense to the supply of physicians, and to the number of young physicians who decide to spe- cialize in psychiatry. Despite strenuous efforts made in recent years to encourage more young physicians to enter into psychiatric residencies, there has been no proportionate increase and, in fact, there has been some ground lost in the past three years. Figure 4 shows the total number of residencies offered in four important medical spe- cialties over the past few years, and indicates no relative gain by psychiatry. For many years the proportion of physicians indicating a limited spe- cialty in psychiatry has remained quite constant between the limits of 54 per cent to 7 per cent (36).

Another indication of the fairly level output of 125.8 per cent. In 1910 there were 3,165 physi-
trained psychiatrists is the number who pass the examinations of the American Board of Examiners in Psychiatry and Neurology each year. Figure 5 illustrates these figures and also shows the even lower level of output in neurology. The number who pass both specialties together is negligible.
Because the supply of psychiatrists is so bound to the supply of physicians, we may well look fur- ther at the latter. Few subjects are so loaded with potential for polemics as the question of whether or not there are enough physicians in this country and whether or not their numbers are increasing or decreasing in comparison with the growth of our population. One of the favorite arguments for ad- vocates of either point of view is to engage in com- parisons between "then and now." The problem is how to choose the most equitable "then." For ex- ample, Turner (33) argues that there are increas- ing numbers of physicians being trained. He says, "While the population of the nation has approxi- mately doubled during this period [1900-1954], in
cians graduated from approved medical schools as compared to 6,861 in 1954, the latter figure repre- senting an increase of 114.8 per cent."3
The trouble, if there is trouble, with Turner's argument is to be found in the expression "ap- proved schools of medicine." In 1910 Flexner
(14) published a monumental report of an in- vestigation of medical schools. He classed 66 as Class A "Approved" schools and 65 as Class B and C "Unapproved" schools. The "Unapproved" schools had, that year, an enrollment of 8,996 students, which, if added to that in "Approved" schools, brings the total enrollment up to 21,526. This figure, if used as a basis for comparison, would mean an increase in enrollment of only 35.8 per cent instead of the 125.8 per cent (125.28 per cent) quoted above. The "Unapproved" schools graduated 1,275 physicians in 1910 making a total

prospects are that we will lose ground when the advantage of increased enrollments and the recent founding of new medical schools are offset by popu- lation increases.

ratio was 1.97to 1." They go on to point out that if the fall in applicants continues just a few more years there will not be enough people to fill medical school vacancies. Other medical educators, writing in the Journal oj Medical Education, warn that "the caliber of applicants to medical schools is falling" (15), and that some schools withgeo- graphic restrictions "had to 'scrape the bottom of the barrel'" (31). We conclude that for the next few years at least, the prospects are not favorable for a major increase in medical school enrollments.
These facts and trends in the supply of physi- cians and medical school enrollments indicate that there is little likelihood of the kind of increase that would be needed to result in a substantial rise in the number of psychiatrists. Increasing justmod- erately the number of medical school graduates would only slightly affect the number of newpsy- chiatric residents because, as a rule of thumb, the number of first-year residents in psychiatry each year is less than 10 per cent of medical school graduation figures.
There is, however, another source of psychiatric residents, and of residents in other specialties as well, which has appeared in recent years. Alien physicians, in increasing numbers, have been ac-
cepted as interns and residents in hospitals in this country. During the past five years the number of alien physicians in all residencies has increased from 8 per cent to 22 per cent. Most of these alien physicians have entered the U. S. under provisions of the U. S. Information and Exchange Act of1948.
Some 20 per cent to 25 per cent of the physicians now in residencies in psychiatry are from abroad and will return home when their training iscom- pleted ( 7 ) . While they offer service during their stay here, they do not represent any permanent in- crease in psychiatric manpower and actually their numbers inflate artificially figures on psychiatric residents in training.
PSYCHOLOGISTS
It is more difficult to define a psychologist than a psychiatrist and meaningful data are harder to obtain for psychology. While many persons em- ployed as psychiatrists have not had as muchspe- cialized training in psychiatry as leaders in the field might prescribe, at least a specified minimum of training is required in that all psychiatrists are physicians and have had the extensive clinical con- tact with patients that medical training involves. Psychology, on the other hand, is a broader and • more loosely denned field in which are employed people with various amounts of formal training. In this respect psychology is more like such spe- cialties as chemistry or engineering than it is like psychiatry.
A second difficulty, for our present purposes, in- volves deciding what proportion of psychologists may be considered to be in the field of mental health. Should we include only clinical psycholo- gists? Certainly people working in vocational guidance, in school psychology, and even some of those concerned with such areas as morale and motivation of military personnel, to cite but a few examples, may be thought of as contributing to mental health. There is no question but that a sizable number of psychologists would argue that they have no direct, and scarcely any indirect, con- cern with mental health. The scientist studying color vision, or the rodentologist with his T-maze, is not likely to welcome classificatory bedfellowship with the professional tester or counselor.
In some of the data we will present below we will use figures based on membership in the Ameri- can Psychological Association. Our rationalization
￼is as follows: over half of the membership of APA is in clinical psychology or closely related areas (30). The total membership of APA is estimated to number about one-half of those employed in this country as psychologists (39). The reader should keep in mind that a sizable proportion of APA members have little or nothing to do with mental health, but that a sizable number of psychologists who are employed in the mental health field are not APA members. The exactness of the balance of these two groups is almost impossible to assess.
What sort of demands for services of psycholo- gists exists in the field of mental health? Once again one has a choice of estimates (2, 3, 11, 12, 20, 28). It is probably safe to say that existing needs could absorb easily an additional ten thou- sand trained people.
Most studies emphasize the need for people at the doctorate level. The Committee on Specialized Personnel of the Office of Defense Mobilization
(28) estimates that PhD's with research experi- ence are in shortest supply, particularly in physio- logical and experimental psychology. On the other hand, the Veterans Administration, projecting its needs for the next decade, indicates a continuing serious shortage of PhD-level clinical psychologists (see Figure 8). Felix (12) says that the southern region (sixteen states) needs seven times as many

clinical psychologists as are now employed, and that eleven western states need a total of 2,000 clinical psychologists.
There is a pervasive belief among psychologists that psychology is one of the fastest-growing fields of specialization. Sanford (29) noted in 1951 that the membership of APA increased nearly twenty- fold in a quarter century. He quotes the extrapo- lation of psychology's growth curve by Boring in which the latter predicts 59 million psychologists a century hence. Carrying the extrapolation fur- ther, Sanford notes that the number of psycholo- gists will catch up with the world's population in less than 150 years! Fortunately, perhaps, there are signs that we are slowing down. Wolfle (39) has shown that the notion of very rapid growth in psychology is only partially true.
For each year of the past five years the number of new Associates of APA has remained fairly con- stant at about 1,300. Figure 9 illustrates the growth of the APA and, for contrast, the growth of the American Psychiatric Association. If, how- ever, we look at the number of PhD's in psychol- ogy and the number of first-year residents in psy- chiatry we see no startling gain for either group
(Figure 10).
Will our universities be able to turn out enough
people to fill the present and projected need for psychologists? The best predictions are that for the next few years we will not step up the number

ogy can expand training programs somewhat more readily as more qualified college graduates are at- tracted to the field. The more serious limitation on numbers of psychologists trained is the supply of college graduates forming the pool of potential graduate students, especially the number of p s y - chology majors. Figure 11 contrasts the numbers of bachelor's, master's, and doctor's degrees c o n - ferred in psychology since 1947-48. It will be noted that while there has been a steady increase in the number of doctorates conferred in psychol- ogy, the number of bachelor's degrees has declined along with the decline in college graduates in gen- eral. It seems certain that the next several years will see a drop, or at least a leveling off, in num- bers of doctorates as graduate school enrollments fall off with the shortage of college graduates we have noted.
A further problem that promises to affect p s y - chology somewhat more than the other mental health fields is the oncoming tide of college s t u - dents described above. The psychologist tradi- tionally has been a teacher, and as psychology is one of the most popular undergraduate subjects there will be an increased demand for college teachers of psychology. This increased demand will follow a decade or so of fairly low-levelpro- duction of doctorates in psychology.
What can the field of psychology do in the face of these prospects of shortages and static output? Is there any way to increase the number of trained psychologists? One thing which comes to mind at once is the value of taking steps now to get infor- mation about scientific and professional opportuni- ties in psychology to students who have not yet chosen their career, and to students majoring in psychology who are not well acquainted with the possibilities of further training. The recent Public Affairs Pamphlet on psychology ( 2 6 ) is one small step in the right direction. Despite the low tide of college students now enrolled, psychology should be able to attract a somewhat larger proportionof able students. Psychology, it should be noted, is the only one of the mental health professions that
has real continuing access to the attention of large numbers of college students before they have made firm decisions on their careers.
More psychology undergraduates might go on to graduate school if large university departments im- proved their contact with these students. Wolfle

of doctorates (39). In fact there will probably be some decline for a time.
University training centers for psychologists en- joy a certain advantage over psychiatric training centers from the point of view of flexibility in ex- panding training programs.

(39) notes that only 12 per cent of students who
￼major in psychology have become professional psy- chologists. But as psychology bachelors comprise a representative cross-section of ability of all those receiving bachelor's degrees, many more than 12 per cent have the intellectual ability to succeed in graduate school (39).
Whatever we do to increase graduate enrollments during the next decade the shortage of psycholo- gists is likely to continue. Some ten to twenty years hence we should be able to increase sizably our output of doctorates. But as we have noted, demands increase as our population increases. There seems little chance that we will have enough psychologists even then.
SOCIAL WORKERS
It was harder to define who is a psychologist than who is a psychiatrist. It is harder still to de- fine who is a social worker.
According to Kendall (21), 'It has been esti- mated that there are approximately 75,000 persons employed in social work positions in the United States, of whom 16 per cent have completed two or more years of graduate study, 11 per cent have had one, but less than two years, 13 per cent have had less than one year, and 60 per cent have had no social work education."
We will be guided in our considerations of num- bers of social workers, and trends in their number, by statements of leaders of the profession itself as to who are social workers. Youngdahl (41) says, "At present the established norm for professional training consists of two years of graduate profes- sional training in an accredited school of social work." This definition agrees with the one used by the Health Resources Advisory Committee (20).
What is the present need for social workers in the mental health field? Let us turn once more to our sources and select some typical estimates. Blain (3) sees a need for 9,000 psychiatric social workers and figures it will take 20 years to find this number. The present shortage in state-sup- ported mental hospitals alone is approximately 7,000 (2) which represents a 75 per cent under- staffing (24). Gorman (17) counts only 800 psy- chiatric social workers in state institutions, which represents an even greater understaffing. At this rate, each social worker has, on the average, re-
sponsibility for six hundred patients. In 1952 there were 2,500 budgeted job vacancies for medi- cal and psychiatric social workers in this country
and a projected need for 4,200 more within five years (20). In these two specialties alone it is estimated that there is a deficit of at least 1,000 each year even if every graduate goes to work (20). Comparable shortages exist in all other fields of social work (12, 16, 21). The Council on Social Work Education (5) estimates that 50,000 new so- cial workers will be needed in the next decade, be- yond those who may leave the field.
How many social workers are being trained? Figure 12 illustrates the ten-year trend in num- bers of full-time students and graduates from two- year programs as compiled by the Council on So- cial Work Education. Once again we observe the postwar rise, but the decline has come earlier in social work than in the other two fields we have studied. From what we have said about the pool of potential professional school students, it will be apparent that the rise in numbers of social work students will be slow. Different specialties within social work show different trends. There has been a decrease in field placements in medical social work and in group work over the past four years and a slight increase in field placements in psychi- atric social work during this same time. All other fields of social work have about held their own (6).

Flo. 12. Students and graduates of two-year social work programs.
￼68 THE AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGIST
A survey in 1952 of 24 schools of social work with approved medical social work curricula showed that the number of students enrolled in this spe- cialty fell short of capacity by 42 per cent, while other schools without specialized curricula but with medical social work field placements were 58 per cent below capacity. It is estimated that these discrepancies between enrollment and vacancies still exist (20) and it is our impression that similar vacancies exist in other social work specialties. Kendall (21) notes that "many of the graduate schools are operating at less than full capacity."
Many reasons have been suggested for the diffi- culties in recruiting social work students and for the growing shortages in the field. One fact is that a high proportion of members of the profession are women (20) who leave the field. Other factors have been suggested by Eaton (9) and include low pay, prestige conflicts, and multiple identifications.
Leaders in social work are trying to step up re- cruitment activities. Among the more frequent ef- forts are programs of on-the-job training for col- lege students during the summer, workshops for college teachers in sociology and anthropology, visits by social work faculty to career conferences on college campuses, and work-study programs for those who cannot afford to spend two years in full- time graduate school study. It should be noted that this last effort, work-study programs, does little to increase the number of social workers, as a majority taking part in these programs are al- ready in the field.
Nothing in view leads to optimistic predictions concerning the problem of finding students for so- cial work in the numbers that are needed. Leaders in the field are making all sorts of active and imaginative efforts, however, and the other profes- sions can learn much from social work in this re- spect.
DISCUSSION
Let us review briefly the important points bear- ing on manpower trends and prospects in the three disciplines we have discussed.
We believe that there is wholehearted unanimity among knowledgeable people about the staggering dimensions of the mental health needs of the na- tion. From whatever viewpoint, be it humani- tarian, economic, or scientific, mental disorder is far and away our number one health problem. It
is real, it is now, and it will not go away. It will only get worse.
Everyone who is aware of the problem agrees that the need for trained professional personnel in the mental health field is desperate. The stark re- ality is that we cannot even keep up present num- bers in proportion to the population. We have not found a single optimistic voice. Occasionally some- one suggests a crash program with recruiting drives, publicity, subsidized training, and special induce- ments to lure more students into training programs. If the mental health professions were the only ones where personnel shortages existed, such pro- grams might be effective in increasing our output of trained people a few years hence. But shortages are not specific to our own fields. They are part of a more pervading shortage of scientific and professional personnel in general. Our pessimistic facts are duplicated in the shortages of teachers, nurses, engineers, and scientists.
But there must be other solutions to the mental health problem. Typhoid fever was not controlled by treating the disease. What about mental health research leading to prevention, or faster cures? As Hastings (19) puts it: "Without more basic knowl- edge than we have today or are now accumulating, the people who follow us fifty years hence will be struggling with the same problems that we are. The almost limitless future for the psychological sciences in the years ahead lies along the avenue of well-planned research activity done by many disciplines."
Psychologists probably receive more formal re- search training than do members of the other two fields. But it is our general impression, and this would be readily testable, that there is an inverse relation between the amount of time psychologists spend on basic research and their proximity to the field of mental health. The clinical psychologist all too often is loaded with service responsibilities, and his research, when he finds time for it, is likely to be concerned with evaluating or improving his skills and techniques rather than being a more basic attack on etiology or pathology. The social worker, too, is trained for service, and despite the growing emphasis on a research orientation in the social work curriculum, a scanning of the social work journals fails to turn up any really basic re- search. We have already noted the shortage of research-oriented psychiatrists.
In recent months there has been a wave of en-
￼thusiasm for the tranquilizing drugs as an aid to speedier and more effective therapy. These early reports would seem to be encouraging indications that research can be productive even at the present rate of expenditure. Let us hope fervently that the reports are all based on careful study, though experience warns us to be cautious about such en- thusiasms. The memory of "focal infections" and "rest cures" and even electroconvulsive therapy bids us be careful. Worse still, if the new drugs fulfill even a portion of their promise we will be worse off than before, for most everyone agrees that the drugs are effective only in combination with psychotherapy. So hospitalized patients who formerly did not see a psychiatrist for long periods are now lining up outside his door.
Much is already known about mental disorder. Whether we agree about causes, at least we can agree that there probably are prophylactic and pre- ventive measures which can be effective if used early enough. One of the important aspects of pre- vention is work with children, or with parents in order to reach children. Again, while there are notable exceptions, and in this area perhaps a few exceptional people can be most influential, we find the usual shortages and lack of interest. Blain
(3) despairs at the trickle of child psychiatrists being turned out—some forty a year—and shows that at this rate of production it will take fifteen years to provide one child psychiatrist each for the 600 clinics needed today, not to mention the de- mands of children's residential homes, juvenile courts, school systems, etc. Similar shortages exist for child workers in the other mental health professions.
What is left? One fairly radical proposal has been made by Hastings (19) (though he credits the idea to Kubie and others). He suggests the creation of a new professional group, trained as psychotherapists, though not required to master all of the knowledge presently in the various profes- sional curricula. These people, who could be trained much more rapidly than can a psychiatrist or a psychologist, would not take over completely the field of therapy but would augment present per- sonnel and perhaps free more highly trained people for research. The obstacles to the implementation of this suggestion are enormous, as Hastings recog- nizes. Another profession on the scene might even increase present shortages in the established pro- fessions, and resistance from many quarters to such
infringement on sovereignty would be strong. But the suggestion is an intriguing one, and what we need (besides personnel, money, facilities, and skill) are ideas which can be implemented.
We can only conclude this survey with the pre- diction that our country will continue to be faced with personnel shortages in psychiatry, psychology, and social work for years to come. Barring the possibility of a massive national effort in all areas of education, or the possibility of a sharp break- through in mental health research, the prospects are pessimistic for improvements in the quantity or quality of service in the field of mental health.

Frank Kameny Biography
You were born in Queens, New York to a middle class Jewish family. Your first academic interest was in science, and by the age of seven, you pledged your commitment in becoming an astronomer. You began your undergraduate degree in physics at Queens College, but you were interrupted by WWII, where you served as an Army Mortar crewman in Europe.  Your mother described you as excessively shy, but your time spent abroad during WWII brought you out of your shell. You returned from the war, finished your undergraduate degree, and went on to receive your PhD in physics from Harvard University in 1956 after being awarded a scholarship.
You have a dominating personality that is a cross between egotism and revolutionary. You have a habit of questioning the status quo and supporting your own conceptions. When you were a teenager, you proclaimed yourself an atheist to your parents. This attitude continued into your teaching fellow years at Harvard where you refused to sign a loyalty oath without attaching qualifiers, stating, “If society and I differ on something, I am willing to give the matter a second look…If we still differ, than I am right and society is wrong.”
Kameny was not so much concerned with changing society in so much as he refused to let society effect his own life. You avoided the exploration of your sexuality, and were therefore unsure of your orientation. You preferred spending your time in observatories. While finishing your dissertation in Arizona, you became friendly with a group of homosexuals and attended a gay bar, to which you stated, “I’ve come home”. You took full advantage of your sexual revelation, and spent the near future making up for lost time.
After receiving your doctorate, you worked as teaching assistant for the astronomy department at Georgetown University, before transferring to the Army Map Service in the heat of the Cold War. During this phase of life, you helped the army more accurately target their nuclear weapons by using points around the U.S to calculate the distance towards targets around the world. In 1957, Army security officials questioned your sexuality, to which you responded by asserting that your personal life was not the business of the federal government. You were immediately dismissed, leaving you jobless and dependent upon charity during the dawn of the space race; a time that should have been the greatest opportunity of your life.  The Federal government’s position was that homosexuality made a person unsuitable for federal employment. You had been dismissed just as hundreds had been before you, but you became the first to ever officially challenge this policy. Initially, legal efforts failed, and even your lawyer determined it best to abandon the case. You pressed on, outlining a case in which you argued that the discrimination you experienced was no less illegal and no less odious than discrimination based upon religious or racial grounds. After citing the Kinsey report, you presented reasonable grounds to believe that 15 million U.S citizens were gay and subject to the same persecution.
When the Supreme Court refused to hear the case once more, you moved to create a movement by founding the Mattachine Society of Washington, which was named after a group of medieval court jesters who were allowed to articulate unpopular truths under the secrecy of masks. The Mattachine Society of Washington was one of the first homosexual organizations to act under the mission of political activism, and focus its efforts on public awareness; its mission: “to act by any lawful means to secure for homosexuals the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness”.  Your influence stemmed heavily from surveying the black civil rights movement, and you eventually shifted homosexuality from a mental health issue to a civil liberties issue. You argued that your opposition was basing its arguments on emotion rather than reason, which prevented the pursuit of education and awareness. You claimed that homosexuals were more likely to have an employment issue than they were a mental health issue due to their sexual orientation.
You enacted a civil rights militancy strategy, taking to the streets, media, and the courts. Although your movement was legally focused, you understood that homosexuality’s classification as an illness was the main obstacle to overcome. You used your background in the sciences to demonstrate that the current view of homosexual psychology was based on psychiatric observations made on behalf of mental patients only, thus ignoring the millions of healthy gay Americans spread throughout the country. Your organization was the first that claimed homosexuality to be, “a preference, orientation, or propensity, on par with, and not different in kind from, heterosexuality”.  However, negative stigmas for homosexuality existed in propensity, thus counteracting the logic of your claims. You modeled a slogan after the African American movement’s, “Black is Beautiful”, thus coining the phrase, “Gay is Good”. America loves slogans, and the country’s “gut” began to shift into your corner. Today you are considered a pioneer in the homosexual civil rights movements, and cited as one of its most important figures.
When the Department of Defense launched an investigation into the sexuality of a young man named Benning Wentworth in 1969, you took the opportunity to testify. Charles Socarides was an expert witness for the prosecution. Your speech, “We Throw Down the Gauntlet” is not a classic in the gay rights movement. It is available here: http://www.kamenypapers.org/gauntlet.htm.
Barbara Gittings Biography
You are a Librarian, activist and a pioneer of the American gay rights movement. You founded the New York chapter of the Daughters of Bilitis and edited its magazine, The Ladder. One of your life-long goals has been to get public libraries to provide more information on homosexuality to the public.
You were born on July 31, 1932 in Vienna, Austria. Your father, a career diplomat, was transferred back to the US in 1940, and your family settled in Delaware.
During your freshman year at Northwestern in 1949, you sought out therapy because you believed you might be a lesbian. The psychotherapist offered to cure you. Rather than submit to treatment, you went to the libraries to find information on homosexuality. The few resources you discovered were filed under 'perverted' or 'abnormal.' Moreover, the material on offer dealt almost exclusively with gay men.
As a result of the time you spent in the library researching homosexuality, you failed out of Northwestern. When you returned 'back east,' you moved to Philadelphia.
But you continued your research. In Philadelphia, you discovered a book titled The Homosexual in America (1951), written under the pseudonym 'Donald Webster Cory .'  You contacted the publisher and eventually contacted the author Edward Sagarin, who introduced you to the fledgling homophile movement, including the Mattachine Society.
When you went out to California to meet with the publishers of ONE, you met Phyllis Lyon and Del Martin, leaders of the lesbian organization Daughters of Bilitis. They asked you to found a chapter in New York, even though it meant a commute from Philly. You accepted.  
At a DOB meeting in 1961, you met another activist named Kay Lahusen. The two of you fell in love and soon became partners for life.
You succeeded Lyon and Martin as editor of DOB's magazine, The Ladder. During your three-year editorship, The Ladder began to publish articles critiquing medical authorities as well as the notion that homosexuals were sick.
In the early 1960's, your position in the DOB lead you to meet and collaborate with Frank Kameny.  Kameny's Washington DC chapter of the Mattachine Society was becoming more and more aggressive in its public advocacy, and you were encouraged. In 1965, you joined Kameny in a picket of  the White House. And the two of you organized annual demonstrations on July 4 at Independence Hall in Philly.
These tactics were not entirely welcome in the community at the time. You left the DOB because of these conflicts and joined Kameny's Mattachine society full time.
Game Objectives
You are the leader of the Gay-PA. After the Stonewall protests of 1969, you've become committed to the idea that street-level protests and direct nonviolent confrontation ('Zaps') are the most effective mechanisms of social change.  You organized the San Francisco protests of 1970, and you have some ideas for 1971 and 1972.
The Gay-PA (in reality, the Chicago branch of the Gay Liberation Front) should issue something like following proclamation at the beginning of the conference in 1971 (distribute it as you see fit – i.e. post it to the door of the room, hand it out as players enter, etc.). It is vital that the draft is approved by the other members of the Gay-PA (Fryer, Hooker, Gold), and you should consult the secret 'young turks' (Marmor, Spiegel):
The establishment school of psychiatry is based on the premise that people who are hurting should solve their problems by “adjusting” to the situation. For the homosexual, this means becoming adept at straight-fronting, learning how to survive in a hostile world, how to settle for housing in the gay ghetto, how to be satisfied with a profession in which homosexuals are tolerated, and how to live with low self-esteem.
The adjustment school places the burden on each individual homosexual to learn to bear his torment. But the “problem” of homosexuality is never solved under this scheme; the anti-homosexualist attitude of society, which is the cause of the homosexual's trouble, goes unchallenged.  And there's always another paying patient on the psychiatrist's couch.
Dr. Socarides claims, “A human being is sick when he fails to function in his appropriate gender identity, which is appropriate to his anatomy.” Who determines “appropriateness”? The psychiatrist as moralist? Certainly there is no scientific basis for defining “appropriate” sexual behavior.... Other than invoking moral standards, Dr. Socarides claims that homosexuality is an emotional illness because of the guilt and anxieties in homosexual life.  Would he als consider Judaism an emotional illness because of the paranoia which Jews experienced in Nazi Germany?
We homosexuals of gay liberation believe that the adjustment school of therapy is not a valid approach to society.
We refuse to adjust to our oppression, and believe that the key to our mental health, and to the mental health of all oppressed peoples in a racist, sexist, capitalist society, is a radical change in the structure and accompanying attitudes of the entire social system.
Mental health for women does not mean therapy for women—it means the elimination of male supremacy. Not therapy for blacks, but an end to racism. The poor don't need psychiatrists (what a joke at 25 bucks a throw!)--they need democratic distribution of wealth. OFF THE COUCHES, INTO THE STREETS!
We see political organizing and collective action as the strategy for effecting this social change. We declare that we are healthy homosexuals in a sexist society, and that homosexuality is at least on part with heterosexuality as a way for people to relate to each (know any men that don't dominate women?).
Since the prevalent notion in society is that homosexuality is wrong, all those who recognize that this attitude is damaging to people, and that it must be corrected, have to raise their voices in opposition to antihomosexualism.  Not to do so is to permit the myth of homosexual pathology to continue and to comply in the homosexual's continued suffering from senseless stigmatization... We furthermore urge psychiatrists to refer to the homosexual patients to gay liberation (and other patients who are the victims of oppression to relevant liberation movements). Once relieved of patients whose guilt is not deserved but imposed, psychiatrists will be able to devote all their efforts to the rich—who do earn their guilt but not their wealth, and can best afford to pay psychiatrists'' fees.
We are convinced that a picket and a dance will do more for the vast majority of homosexuals that two years on the couch.  We call on the medical profession to repudiate the adjustment approach as a solution to homosexual oppression and instead to further homosexual liberation by working in a variety of political ways (re-educating the public, supporting pickets, attending rallies, promoting social events, etc.) to change the situation of homosexuals in this society.
Join us in the struggle for a world in which all humans are free to love without fear or shame.
(quoted in Rosario, 2002)

As a non-member of the APA, you cannot vote on the definition of mental illness. But be sure to advocate for one that does not penalize or marginalize those with harmless social differences.
Specific Assignments
Participate in the 1971 panel discussion with John Fryer and Evelyn Hooker. The texts of Kameny and Gitting's actual speeches are not recorded (to my knowledge), but Gittings' was probably titled “Gay, Proud and Healthy.”  Eyewitnesses record that Kameny was more confrontational and antagonistic to psychiatry while Gittings was more conciliatory. Kameny is quoted as arguing that “We're rejecting you all as our owners. We possess ourselves and we speak for ourselves and we will take care of our destines.” (Quoted in Bayer, 2002 p. 106).
As B. Gittings, propose a study, similar to E. Hookers, on lesbians, recruiting from the Daughters of Bilitis in 1971.  You can see the gamemaster or the original Siegelman, 1972.
Petition the conference committee for a display booth for 1972 titled 'Gay, Proud and Healthy', get Fryer and others to sit at the booth and take questions. As a student, if you are interested, there are photos of the actual booth available at http://digitalgallery.nypl.org/nypldigital/id?1606166. You should distribute a pamplet as well (the Kameny papers archive has a copy of the original, for inspiration).
You should maintain 'zapping' events where you determine discrimination, or the intellectual basis for discrimination, occur.
Help organize a symposium in 1973 on the topic of “Should Homosexuality Be in the APA Nomenclature?”

Psychoanalyst Overview:

The central issue in this game—whether it be voiced in the selection of experiments to be run via the grants committee or in the classification of mental illness in the nomenclature committee—is the the nature of the scientific investigation of the human mind. For the psychoanalysts, as opposed to the behaviorists, the science of the mind is not about predicting and controlling behavior. It is about discovering the true things about our minds.  Thus, a treatment or theory is judged as 'good' or 'working' not if it changes the behavior of a person, but whether or not that person gains insight into their own minds.

When practicing a technique like free association or transference, a psychoanalyst does not seek to discover what a given symbol means to everyone, as a matter of a law-like generalization. Rather, a psychoanalyst seeks to discover what a given symbol means to the person being analyzed. It follows that a given discovery may not generalize over individuals. But that does not mean that that discovery is wrong or false. It stands to reason, then, that one does not have the ground to criticize psychoanalysis until one has experienced psychoanalysis first hand.

Most famous quote on Freud, from the preface to The Psychology of Dementia Praecox (see Storr)
 I can assure the reader that in the beginning I naturally entertained all the objections that are customarily made against Freud in the literature. ... Fairness to Freud does not imply, as many fear, unqualified submission to a dogma; one can very well maintain an independent judgment. If I, for instance, acknowledge the complex mechanisms of dreams and hysteria, this does not mean that I attribute to the infantile sexual trauma the significance that Freud does. Still less does it mean that I place sexuality so predominantly in the foreground, or that I grant it the psychological universality which Freud, it seems, postulates in view of the admittedly enormous role which sexuality plays in the psyche. As for Freud's therapy, it is at best but one of several possible methods, and perhaps does not always offer in practice what one expects from it in theory. (Jung, 1906, 3-4; Kerr, 115-116)

            <Text>Cognitivist Overview

Cognitivist Psychology, and the affiliated disciplines that make up 'Cognitive Science': linguistics, computer science, philosophy and neuroscience, owe an intellectual and cultural debt to behaviorism. While many in the cognitivist community see themselves in the tradition of William James, John Dewey and the 'Chicago school,' most cognitivists were trained as behaviorists.  They do not differ with behaviorists with respect to the metaphysical thesis that the mind is physical. They differ on the basic object of study of psychology: the cognitivists hold that psychology is the study of the mind, not just behavior.
Theoretically, cognitivism marries information theory of computer science to psychology and neurobiology. It sees mental states and processes as informational states and processes which are realized in the computational 'hardware' of the brain. Thus, a proper explanation of psychology should not only describe the behavior of the organism, it should also explain the informational algorithm that drives that behavior, and the neurobiological states that implement the algorithm.
You are neutral on the issue of the definition of mental illness, but be ready to oppose any definition that is clearly behaviorist or psychoanalytic in nature.

Such a conference was held April 18-20, 1969, arranged for and chaired by George Albee. A report of this conference was prepared by Albcc and was presented to the Board of Directors at its meeting on May 1S-T7, 1969. After careful consideration of the
Report of the Conference, the report was "Received with lhanks by the Al'A Board of Directors and was referred to the APA governance for study and recommendation,noting that individuals in the field and in funding agencies should also play a role." Such action by the Board of Directors will insure continued attention by APA boards and com- mittees to those appropriate matters and issues discussed with representatives of the Association of Black Psycholo- gists and to the mallei's symbolized by the Statement of Concern.

Chairmen, and the Committee on Equality of Op- portunity in .Psychology, invited persons with special technical competence, and resource people from Federal agencies and from the staff of APA.
In the course of the discussions the Conference participants became increasingly aware of the ex- tent of underrepresentation of minority groups in psychology; they became impressed, too, with the urgency with which those in American psychology must act both to put our own house in order and to set an example to other organizations that may be expected to be encouraged to follow our lead. For example, we were impressed with the facts, well documented by the Committee on Equality of Opportunity in Psychology, that the 10 most prestigious departments of psychology in the United States granted only 8 PhDs in psychology to Negro candidates between 1920 and 1966 while granting a total of 3,767 PhDs during this period; six of these leading departments had not had a single Negro PhD. Of the largest producers of PhDs during this period fewer than 1 % of the doctorates were won by black students. (Tt is these same departments, we cannot resist noting, that supply the bulk of psychological consultation to Federal
training and research programs.)
The Conference participants are aware of the
fact that deeply held attitudes and behavior pat- terns cannot be legislated out of existence and that pious platitudes cannot change the world. But we also are aware that leaders who truly lead can often mobilize widespread readiness for positive action, and so we urge the APA Council, boards, and committees, and our whole organizational and staff structure, to provide leadership in expanding the opportunities for black and other minority group students and faculty to enter the mainstream of psychology.
The tenor of the discussion was serious and con- cerned, and seldom unreasonable. Participants generally agreed that large efforts had to be made at all levels—making opportunities available in

￼graduate departments for qualified black and other minority group students, with special financial as- sistance earmarked; improving the quality of under- graduate education in psychology at predominant!}' black colleges; recruiting more able undergraduates to these departments; improving the educational opportunities in elementary and secondary schools for disadvantaged students; and working to elimi- nate the effects of racism throughout our society. At the same time it was recognized that there is an important substantive body of knowledge in psy- chology and that graduate work makes strenuous
demands. One of the black participants said it well: "There is a great need to avoid the encourage- ment, implicit or otherwise, of 'half-baked,' non- scientific black departments of psychology for the production of instant black psychologists whose only forte would be some vague 'community psy- chology'." This same man spoke of the urgency of "recruiting and holding capable faculty mem- bers, updating and in most instances creating adequate facilities for laboratory experiences, up- dating and increasing library resources, and offering financial support to students who frequently are indigent."
We were impressed with the findings of the Wispe Committee on Equal Opportunities that more than half of all Negro psychologists live in the South, and an even higher percentage were born there and received their bachelor's degrees there. We agree with this Committee that "More active steps should be taken . . . to recruit and train for careers in psychology graduates from Negro colleges, especially located in the South."
studying the problems of recruiting minority group students for careers in psychology, and is presently preparing a proposal that, after being approved by APA governance, will go to the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH). Tt is the belief of the Committee that existing programs such as the National Science Foundation Visiting Scientist Pro- gram, the Careers-in-Psychology program, etc., are not especially suitable for this purpose; their proposal will use integrated visiting teams carrying out a carefully planned program.
We note the encouraging fact that the prestigious Council of Graduate Department Chairmen has appointed a committee to concern itself with ways of encouraging the admission of more black and other minority group students into graduate study in psychology. We urge this organization to find creative ways quickly, and we concur with the recommendation of the Wispe Committee that "More elasticity in admission requirements for graduate training should be considered by the . . . Conference of Graduate Department Chairmen."
The matter of admission requirements, par- ticularly the predictive value of highly verbal tests, is a complex subject, but the Conference spent some time discussing these problems. While recognizing that verbal tests are unquestionably predictive of college and graduate school grades in a system that emphasizes verbal performance, the Conference also noted the relatively low predictive value of graduate school classroom performance for later scientific or professional success.

The Committee on Equal Opportunities has been as they begin to approximate scientific and profes-
on ultimate career patterns.
In this regard there was discussion of the ques-
tion of the relevance of much of the content of graduate education in psychology to critical human problems on which man's survival itself may de- pend—problems like war, overpopulation, racism, and the increasing pollution of our social and physical environment. APA cannot tell university departments what to teach, but we do know enough about reinforcement theory to suggest that both

sional concern with these problems. We note with approval that the theme of the 1969 Annual ATA Convention is "Psychology and Problems of So- ciety."
Each board and committee, each division of APA, and each state psychological association should examine its current activities and its com- mittee structure to see what steps it can take to deal with current problems of the black psycholog- ical community.
We encourage divisions and stale associations to devote more attention in their newsletters and at their annual programs to the creation of a climate that encourages the application of psychological research and knowledge to reduce racism and the problems it creates. We would hope, for example, that those divisions and state associations that sponsor postdoctoral institutes and workshops might devote time to the psychological aspects of racism.
We suggest that divisional and state psycholog- ical groups consider what they might do to acquaint qualified minority group students in high schools and colleges with career opportunities in psy- chology; we recommend also that some of the obvious energies of the state associations, so long expended in legislative and other professional matters, be directed toward finding creative ways of increasing the number of disadvantaged students in undergraduate and graduate programs in psy- chology and increasing the participation of black psychologists in psychological association programs.
Among the other recommendations coming out of the Conference are the following:
We would ask APA to recommend that NTMH add extra stipends to existing training grants, stipends specifically earmarked for higher risk minority group students who might be encouraged in some cases to spend a "bridge year" in courses selected as preparatory to graduate study.
We further urge that APA use its influence with NIMH, the Office of Education, and the Social Rehabilitation Service to seek new and effective ways to fund programs for minority group students, especially at the undergraduate level, with the goal of increasing the pool of potential graduate students for the human service professions. Such support might carry over to the early years of graduate school in the way Social Science Research Council support is now given.
In this context we would also ask that Federal granting agencies make a more effective effort at involving qualified black and other minority group psychologists and social scientists on their panels, study sections, and staffs. As noted elsewhere in this report the most prestigious universities, which supply a large proportion of government consult- ants and panel members, have not been distinguished as producers of black PhDs and so may not be expected to have special qualifications in this gen- eral area.
The Education and Training Board of APA has extensive contacts with nearly every graduate doc- toral program in the country. Questions asked by its site visitors receive careful attention and may promote desirable changes. While the Education and Training Board cannot and should not dictate admissions or patterns of graduate training it could seek out and encourage demonstration programs more consistent with the needs of minority group students and experimentation with curriculum changes.
As another example of what APA could do, the Committee on Subdoctoral Education in Psychology could develop recommendations for special pro- grams designed to remedy critical shortages in such fields as MA-level black counselors for community colleges or of Mexican-American and Puerto Rican school psychologists. The various curriculum pro- grams being developed can focus on problems of relevance and also on recruitment of minority group students. It is expected that representatives of the Association of Black Psychologists and other minority groups might make useful contributions to these developments.
The AP A Committee on Precollege Psychology and the Division 2 Committee on Psychology in the High Schools could pay special attention to the problems of largely black or Mexican-American or Puerto Rican high schools.
We cite these merely as examples of actions pos- sible at many levels of APA governance structure.
One of the recurring themes throughout the Conference was the urgent need for black role models in psychology—persons who might be ex- amples to black undergraduates of the opportunities available to them in psychology. Because of the relatively small number of black psychologists and especially black college teachers, and because the large and affluent largely white universities are
￼hiring black faculty away from the predominantly black southern colleges, this is an increasingly serious need.
We recommend that APA develop a series of training films featuring black and other minority group psychologists for use in classrooms in both largely black and largely white institutions. APA's demonstrated competence in this area (e.g., "Focus on Behavior") and the potential attractiveness of such a project to NIMH suggest that this proposal be given high priority by the Board.
Numerous other examples will occur to members of various boards and committees to whom we hope the Board will direct proposals for action.
The Conference noted with concern the fact that a large number of black psychologists belong neither to APA nor to state or local psychological associations. While there may have been good reasons in the past why these psychologists felt that APA, and the other professional groups, had little to offer them, it is our hope that this situation no longer obtains. Other special groups in psy- chology have found that an organized effort, even by a relatively small number, can have dramatic effects on the APA governance structure, including changes in the distribution of budgeted activities; black and other minority group psychologists may note that this Conference, and many other cur- rent APA activities, have been triggered by the
"Statement of Concerns" of the Association of Black Psychologists presented to Council in Oc- tober 1968. We hope this lesson is not lost and that organizational activity within APA by black psychologists will increase.
The Conference asked that APA use its influence to assure itself of nondiscriminating practices among its service users and contractors—printers, ad- vertisers, employer listings, etc. A statement to this effect should be carried in contracts, promo- tional material, and publications.
We also recommend to the Editor that a new and regularly scheduled section of the American Psychologist be created, to report on "Psychology and Problems of Society," which might serve as a source of information to our members about signifi- cant developments in research, in Federal and state programming, and in the activity of our science as a means of promoting human welfare.
We further recommend that eventually a position be created in the Central Office under the general direction of the Executive Officer to be concerned with relating psychology to social problems includ- ing those dealt with in this report.
We urge that the Board of Directors of APA approve the spirit of these recommendations and refer them as appropriate for action to boards, committees, divisions, and state associations.

and the confounding effects of unsuspected or uncontrolled variables that have led to premature "discoveries." He concludes that of all the new reports of toxic materials in the blood of schizophrenics "there has been no extensive substantiation of any of them" (p. 418). He continues: "Many of the cur- rent hypotheses concerning the schizophre- nia complex are original and attractive even though, up to this time, evidence directly implicating anyone of them in the disease itself is hardly compelling" (p. 426).
If there is no convincing evidence that schizophrenia is an identifiable disease, there is far less scientific support for a sickness model explanation of all of the less extreme forms of human deviation, yet the American Psychiatric Association keeps issuing posi- tion statements claiming responsibility for such conditions as mental retardation, ju- ~enile delinquency, and alcoholism.

With hundreds of thousands of daily drug users in the public hospitals, plus millions more seeking tranquility or at least relief from intense anxiety, the psychotropic drugs have become a fantastic growth industry. Understandably any threat to the sickness model is a threat to the drug salesmen. What is good for General Napoleon is good for United Chemical!
By using drugs for the poor in the state hospitals we can get by with practically no professional personnel in these tax-sup- ported settings. (In over one-third of our state hospitals practically no psychiatric
. time is available, and two-thirds of our 2,000 psychiatric clinics do not have a single full-time psychiatrist on the staff[ 1] ) . Eighty percent of psychiatric practice is pri- vate office practice with a suburban upper- middle class clientele.
Jules Henry (5) says: "State hospitals to- day seem to exhale from their antique bricks and dark labyrinths the miasmas of mis- understanding, prejudice, .callousness, and hate whose origins lie deep in pur history. Who knows what happens in the pit, where their voices do not come up to us?" (p. 48).
The point of all of this argument should not be lost. Psychiatry, in insisting on its prerogatives of primary patient responsibility and control of treatment institutions and intervention efforts of all sorts, bases its argument either on rare and uncertain genetic and metabolic conditions or on those common chronic organic mental conditions which it characteristically neglects. Most of psychiatric practice is private, most of it is suburban, and most hospital psychiatry is practiced in general hospitals. None of the organic mental conditions is the central con- cern of current psychiatric treatment.
A great majority of the people whom psy- chiatrists treat are not suffering from genetic, metabolic, and arteriosclerotic conditions, or from alcoholic delirium, or from central ner- vous system malfunction. If psychiatrists were to devote their primary attention to these kinds of cases there would be little need for today's debate about models. Repeatedly,

arguing for its replacement with a social- developmental model. Certainly the most fundamental contribution of Freud was his discovery of the continuity between the nor- mal and the abnormal. In discussing Dar- win and Freud, Jerome Bruner pointed out that the Victorians, reeling from Darwin's discovery of a perfectly lawful continuity be- tween man and the rest of the animal king- dom, were dealt a second and more terrifying blow by Freud's discovery of the continuity between the sane and the insane. Bruner( 3 ) speaks of the
state hospitals and public clinics would be replaced by social intervention centers, largely staffed by people at the bachelor's level-more like special education teachers and social welfare workers, potentially avail- able in vastly greater supply than psychol- ogists and psychiatrists. For prevention, peo- ple like ourselves would be needed as teachers, researchers, and especially as rad- ical social activists proselytizing for changes in our society to make it more supportive, less dehumanized.
The massive deterioration of the fabric of soc[ety and its institutions results in a com-

animal kihgdom, between dreams and unrea- plex tangle of pathology. The pathology
son on one side and waking rationality on the other, between madness and sanity, between consciousness and unconsciousness; between the mind of the child and the adult mind, be-
includes especially the destruction of the emotional integrity of the family. Let me emphasize here something that you already know very well. Many significant research breakthroughs have already been made. Many of the discoveries are already in. We know, for example, that the emoti6nal cli- mate which surrounds the infant and young child is of critical importance in determining his future-including the kind, the severity, and perhaps even the biological concomi- tants of his later disturbance.
Such knowledge is dangerous. We usually shut our eyes to its implications. We go on trying to fix up damaged adults in one-to- one relationships when a more proper pro- fessional function would be to spend a con- siderable portion of our energies trying to fix up our society in ways that will increase the strength and stability of the family, there- by affecting positively the mental health of generations to come. It is not possible here to further elaborate upon prevention except to say that I believe, because of the nature of the human animal, it must take the form of strengthening the institution of the family.
I believe that history may judge President Johnson to have been one of the most com- plicated of American presidents. But his speech at Howard University's commence- ment will be judged among the half-dozen great landmarks in the history of our society. In it the President called for a massive attack on the central problem of our time. He said:

these has been a cherished discontinuity pre- served in doctrinal canons.
Freud forced the abandonment of thes~ cherished discontinuities.
Why, in the face of this central message of Freud's life work, does the latter-day psy- choanalyst continue to pay homage to the sickness model? Primarily, I think, because of the historical accident which has re- quired the psychoanalyst in the United States to be trained first as a physician. I look for- ward to the day when the psychoanalysts, perhaps in continuing self-analysis, will join forces with Freud and the rest of us who be- lieve the evidence supports a continuity mod- el, a model which holds that it is established that the same mechanisms are operating in adaptive and maladaptive human behavior, and will help lead the scientific assault on those who seek to preserve and defend the sickness model.

Case Western Reserve University
x
LJNTCAL psychology has entered a paradox- Cical phase in its development where its prob- lems of identity and relevance threaten it with extinction at the same time that its oppor- tunities seem boundless. The demand for clinical psychologists far exceeds the number available or
being trained. While able undergraduates in greater numbers than ever before are knocking on the doors of our graduate schools seeking admission to clinical training programs, these schools are ac- cepting fewer clinical students. Indeed, clinical programs are being dropped or sharply curtailed by many prestigious universities.
Professional psychologists are increasingly critical of existing graduate programs, charging that the curriculum is irrelevant and inappropriate and that deliberate efforts are being made to dry up the supply of future clinicians.
What are some of the forces responsible for this strange state of affairs, where everyone seems eager to expand training in clinical psychology except the field of psychology itself, particularly those fields of scientific psychology that control the graduate programs?
Let me suggest that the basic incompatibilities between the field of clinical psychology and the parent discipline have reached the point where only drastic changes may be effective in preserving the profession.
Our problems in clinical psychology are based in part on the location of our training, because this creates our ideology, our self-image, and our goals, and in part on the fundamental incompatibility of the roles of scientist and professional within one individual. Let me examine these two basic prob- lems in some detail.
Some years ago, Roger Barker suggested that a good way to predict the behavior of a human being

is to find out where he is. While I do not wish to take a position that suggests total control of behav- ior by the immediate environment, I would agree that a person does behave differently in a research lab, at a football game, in a cocktail lounge, and in an APA Council meeting. ] would also argue that for 25 years clinical psychologists have be- haved in ways responsive to the location of their training, partly in academic departments and partly in psychiatric settings. In both settings, they have
been treated as second-class citizens.
Clinical psychology is making the painful dis-
covery that academic departments of psychology in the faculty of arts and sciences are not the best places in which to train professionals and that the psychiatric setting is an unsatisfactory place to learn the ideology of practice. But it is hard to change tradition, even if tradition is only 25 years

old. Warren Bennis has observed that changing a university is about as easy as reorganizing a ceme- tery! There will be many serious obstacles to changes in the pattern of training of professional psychology. Let me direct your attention to some of these obstacles.
For one thing, clinical psychology differs in its origins from practically every other major profes- sion. Other professions began as loose organiza- tions of people delivering services needed by soci- ety, or segments of society, and the service was delivered in the marketplace. One received one's training by apprenticeship. If you wanted to be a social worker, you went to work in a settlement house or social welfare agency. Aspiring physicians were apprenticed to a practicing doctor. It was possible to "read law" in a lawyer's office. Gradu- ally, following a sociological law which says that aspiring professionals must learn theory and knowl- edge based on research before learning skills, pro-
fessional training moved onto the university campus. There it took root with separate professional facul- ties, separate professional degrees, and, for the most part, separate captive practicum training facilities where students could be apprentices of senior pro- fessionals. So, we find that all professional schools teach theory during the early part of their programs, but insure that their fledgling professionals receive extensive apprenticeship training in captive service facilities with successful practitioner role-models who often donate their time to the professional school in exchange for prerogatives such as bed privileges, honorific titles, or free office space and secretarial help.
Clinical psychology has a very different history. I will not tire you with its recitation because it is so familiar. Let me simply remind you that clinical psychology began as a small offshoot of academic, scientific psychology, growing within the confines of the graduate school where professional educa- tion was unfamiliar. In addition, I have been pointing out for several years that clinical psychol- ogy has owned no captive practicum training facil- ity of its own, and so, like the cuckoo, it has had to place its eggs in other birds' nests. In 1946, graduate departments of psychology accepted the invitation of the Veterans Administration to send clinical students for paid internships in their psy- chiatric settings. Experience in psychiatric settings quickly became mandatory—with the result that we became members of a Team in a game where we
had little influence on the rules and no choice of ballpark. Back home in the graduate department, faculty members teaching clinical courses were often nonscientific, or young, or adjunct, but in most cases low status. The clinical students had the worst of both worlds. Some adapted, some tried to outscience the scientists, and many identified with the aggressor and adopted the values and language of psychiatry. Clinical psychology does not control its own faculty appointments and pro- motions; instead, recommendations from the de- partment are made to a faculty supercommittee that consists of nonpsychologists including profes- sors from the sciences, arts, and humanities, most of whom are completely uninformed about the spe- cial needs and requirementsof a professional train- ing program. The present PhD programs in clin- ical psychology must depend for support on budgets controlled by academic vice-presidents, graduate school deans, and department chairmen, most of whom are either unsympathetic toward, or ignorant of, both the financial requirements of professional training, the need for professional staff qualified to teach skills, and the need for our own service- delivery programs for practicum training.
The establishment of separate programs for clinical psychology would be enormously expensive. Federal funding (NIMH) is the most likely source, and it is not a very promising one, not only because of sharply reduced funding in prospect, but also because historically the N I M H has served the psychiatric establishment. In view of its elimina- tion of psychology as a separate branch, together with many indicators in recent years that the powers at NIMH are engaged in decision making that reduces support of psychology training, I see no reason for optimism that very many separate schools of clinical psychology will flourish with NIMH nurturance.
The academic department is the wrong place to teach professional psychology, and the psychiatric setting is the wrong place for apprenticeship train- ing. In psychiatric settings, the clinical psycholo- gist in training learns to speak the language of psychiatry, learns to use and accept the sickness model, and often aspires to a career in the private practice of psychotherapy.
In adopting the sickness explanation from psychi- atry, the psychologist, perhaps unwittingly, sup- ports those cultural forces of reaction that delay the social changes essential to the prevention of
￼emotional distress, and that bar intervention by modestly trained therapists. If mentally disturbed individuals are suffering from some unknown and undiscovered illness rather than damaged by a hostile and evil social environment, then the strat- egy for action calls for discovery of the cause of the disease rather than social action to change the dehumanizing forces of society.
Perhaps the most serious consequence for clin- ical psychology deriving from its near-total im- mersion in the psychiatric setting is that clinical psychologists and their students have been exposed to a very narrow range of human problems and, without any real opportunity to think about the matter, have accepted the psychiatric definition, confused as it is, of who is to receive our interven- tion. As a result, our selected treatment population is largely restricted to the two groups traditionally served in psychiatric settings. The first of these groups, usually found in the general hospital, espe- cially the university hospital, is the white middle- class neurotic who seeks prolonged psychothera- peutic relationships—people whom Schofield has described as having the Y A VIS syndrome (young, attractive, verbal, intelligent, and successful). The second group clinical psychology has learned to work with is the seriously disturbed poor who are incarcerated in tax-supported state and Veterans Administration hospitals. These groups are so familiar to us, and we have been brainwashed so long into believing that they represent most of the universe of emotionally disturbed people, that our textbooks, our courses, our case-seminars, our p e r - sonality theories, and our field work placements for students draw on experience with these groups. If, 25 years ago, enormously increased amounts of federal support for training in psychological inter- vention had been funneled through the public school system, rather than through psychiatric facilities, the present nature of clinical psychology would have been altogether different. Or, if psychological manpower had been supported and trained through the welfare system, we would be a still different field today.
What I am suggesting to you is that we try now standing back at as great a distance and with as much perspective as we can manage, to see what are the truly most pressing psychological problems that afflict our society, and whether clinical psy- chology, or some new field of applied psychology like community psychology, might not select these
more urgent human emotional problems as our focus after breaking free of psychiatric influence on our choice. Must we work on problems and programs only because financial support for them is available, or can we assume some responsibility for developing public awareness and then public support for intervention with the real problems of our society?
Let me suggest to you, as one example, that racism is a far more serious, pathological, and deep-seated emotional problem in our society than either the sexual neuroses of latter-day Victorians or the existential neuroses of the affluent. Racists do share some of the pathological symptoms we encounter in the clinic. The racist is delusional. He believes things to be true that are not true because such beliefs serve deep unconscious emo- tional needs, and his belief is unshakable by reason or logic. How much individual case-study have clinical psychologists done with the individual racist, and where have we studied the epidemiology of racism? Unless our society solves the problems of racism, we are not going to survive as a nation. Does this mental condition not merit our attention? Have we tried to do anything in the way of mean- ingful intervention with the racists? The mental health field has been enchanted in recent years with the development of store-front intervention centers in the slums where local indigenous workers, know- ing the language and culture, have been effective in working with the people of these depressed neighborhoods. But why has clinical psychology not opened its own store-front intervention centers in suburbia, staffed by psychologists who speak the language and understand the white suburban affluent culture, to intervene with the local inhabi- tants afflicted with racism and other virulent forms of prejudice? Why are we so much less threatened by the neuroses of sex than we are by the neuroses of hate? Perhaps, because psychiatry has had little interest in the pathology of aggression, neither have we.
Similarly, clinical psychology has paid almost no attention to the damaging emotional consequences of discrimination based on sex, and yet sexism, like racism, is almost entirely a psychological process, especially a learning process. Schizophrenia is one of the three major subjects each year in Psycho- logical Abstracts reflecting the time, energy, and resources we invest in studying this condition. T am suggesting there are other, more immediate and
UNCERTAIN FUTURE OF CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGY 1073

pressing social problems that we should turn our attention to, problems not usually defined as "psychiatric" but which are surely psychological.
We have taught our students for years that mental cases include those people who are "danger- ous to themselves or others." But we have chosen to intervene with a very restricted range of those who are dangerous to others. Who is move danger- ous to his fellow human beings than the sophisti- cated racist? Racist attitudes and behavior, which can be found in a great many places throughout our social and economic institutions, including our state and federal governments, are far more dangerous to others than schizophrenia.
I would suggest as a further example that certain economic philosophies that are prevalent in our society are also exceptionally dangerous to others. An economic philosophy that justifies the maximiza- tion of profit at the expense of the safety, health, and happiness of the citizen should be as much a concern of the mental health worker, particularly the clinical and community psychologist, as more traditional forms of neurosis. In the last few years, I have been driven to conclude that an affluent white Protestant elite, which controls most of our major corporations and our banking system, and indirectly much of our government at all levels, engages in a mammoth, self-seeking, power- and profit-motivated enterprise which results in in- equitable distribution of jobs, resources, and health care, and affects even such fundamentals as life expectancy. The most visible victims are the urban black people, but T would hasten to point out that there arc millions of poverty-stricken whites in Appalachia and elsewhere who, together with the American Indians and the Mexican-Americans, arc
also victimized by the economic system. Women are also victimized and exploited by our system. If professional psychologists were truly concerned with human welfare, we could forget "psychiatric patients" for a century and turn our attention to the psychological causes of racism, sexism, and of the profit motive as sources of danger to the human- centered life.
I am not so quixotic as to believe that clinic;il psychology can have any immediate dramatic effect on these systems. But if we are not concerned with human contributions to human suffering, who else should be working on these problems?
The assassination of John Kennedy may have been a major mark on the bench of history. It is
possible that Kennedy's death marked the demise of liberal optimism for a century. The liberal expectation of the gradual triumph of human sanity and reason has had to yield to the fearful fact that good and humanistic forces may not ultimately overcome. While people in many parts of the world have believed for a long time that injustice and human exploitation are the inexorable laws of life, there has been cause for optimism in our democratic society that man might indeed be his brother's keeper. The death of the young hero sharpened our perceptions so that we are now more receptive to the naked reality of human exploita- tion and psychopathic manipulation of people by people. Harold Lasswell (1970) said at our Con- vention last year:
If the earlier promise was that knowledge would make men free, the contemporary reality seems to be that more men are manipulated without their consent for more purposes by more techniques by fewer men than at any time in history [p. 119].
Surely, the cynical manipulation of the masses by powerful elites is a subject worthy of psychological investigation. Which groups arc most "dangerous to others"? Our society locks up overt paranoids. But it pays honor and respect to the industrialist who builds automobiles that are death traps, who sprays our fruit with coal tar poisons, and who shows utter disregard for public good in a simple- minded search for profits and power. Why have clinical psychologists not been concerned with the motivations of the manipulators? When the Con- gress refuses to include farm workers under mini- mum wage and health-legislation, it dooms hundreds of thousands of children and adults to lives of hopeless poverty and disease. When giant chemical companies dump deadly poisons into our streams and lakes, psychology should be involved in apply- ing its knowledge to prevention of such destruction.
In brief, the relevance of both our curriculum and of our internship experience must be questioned if we are not to have our roles defined for us by the values and goals of psychiatry and of the prevailing economic philosophy.
But there is another serious problem as well. The truly crippling sources of cognitive dissonance in the professional psychologist, which may ulti- mately destroy the unity of psychology, are the fundamental differences between the scientist and the professional. A primary one involves self-
￼criticism and mutual criticism. Science is open, and its knowledge is public. Any discrepancies in knowledge are debated openly. One of the hall- marks of science is its insistence on public dis- closure of findings. Graduate students in science are taught that research is not completed until the findings are made public. A freewheeling spirit of incisive mutual and self-criticism, replication, debate, and argument over procedures, findings, and interpretation of data, is ever-present. In sharp contrast, a profession must jealously guard its secrets! Historically, one of the hallmarks of a profession has been the privacy of its knowledge. Tf the knowledge of the professional, his techniques, and his skills are available to anyone, and could be performed by anyone, a profession would dis-
integrate. Secrecy and mystery are essential. Even a special technical language is a universal characteristic of the profession. Why were pre- scriptions written in Latin? Why does a profession develop its own jargon, its own secret language? Why are professions protected by strict licensing laws that actually proscribe certain of their activities to anyone but the qualified professional?
The first professionals, according to Veblen, were the priests who thousands of years ago guarded the Egyptian temples at night and took the opportunity to observe the transit of the stars in the heavens. They discovered that the flood of the Nile co- incided with the juxtaposition of certain stars. Im- mediately, they had powerful knowledge of great value to their society, and, like professionals ever since, they kept their knowledge secret, thus pre- serving the prestige of their profession, their credi- bility, and their godlike qualities. While profes-
sions exist to serve society, they must protect what they know, and they must always pretend to know more than they do in order to retain public confi- dence. In contrast, science abhors secrecy and does not tolerate faking or pretense.
One of the most serious problems for the scientist-professional psychologist (Boulder model) has been the requirement that he play the incom- patible game of science, and so subject his tech- niques, his theories, and his methods to open public, critical, scientific scrutiny. If other pro- fessions had to engage in the kind of self-criticism and mutual criticism that clinical psychologists are required to perform, they would be experiencing the same agony as we. Imagine the chaos if public
and open debate and criticism were the rule in medical office diagnosis, drug therapies, surgery, etc. Let me illustrate my point with one example-—• what could have been clinical psychology's most mysterious and powerful magic—the Rorschach. Here was a procedure that fulfilled most of the criteria establishing the power of an independent profession. The Rorschach belonged to psychol- ogy. It had enormous face validity and credibility, and it required long and arduous supervised train- ing before one could be expert in its mysteries and its mystique. Its powers were so great that all sorts of controls had to be placed around the preparation of those who would be using it. Twenty years ago, most of us believed in the art of the Rorschach. The public was fascinated by
the magic we owned. Other professions viewed our magic with respect. But along came the hard- nosed scientists, the measurement people, with their questions about reliability and validity, with their split-half techniques, and their demand for public demonstration of the value of our magic under strictly controlled conditions. As a consequence, the Rorschach is quietly disappearing from the professional psychology scene because of our pro- fessional sensitivity to the claims of science. Inter- estingly, the public still believes in the Rorschach. Similarly, the process of psychotherapy—a mysteri- ous alchemy of great power and public interest—has
been subjected to controlled studies, to long-term follow-up, to objective evaluation procedures, to the point where it has lost considerable credibility within psychology, although professional ingenuity in inventing new forms of psychotherapy has at least kept pace with the efforts of evaluators to catch up and expose it!
Another related source of conflict: The research methods available to clinical psychology are not as pure and powerful as those in experimental psy- chology. Inasmuch as the heroes of any profession are the scientists who supply it with its soundest, most valid knowledge, the weaker research methods of the clinician subject him to criticisms that only add to his inferiority feelings. Anthropologists tell us that there are still societies that are unaware of the relationship between sexual intercourse and pregnancy. Many of the relationships important to the clinical psychologist are of this sort, par- ticularly the relationship between childhood experi-
ences and adult behavioral disturbances. The

farther causes and effects are separated in time, or the more occasions where a possible cause is not followed by the possible effect, the more difficult is the relationship to unravel through research. The hundreds of years that elapsed before the discovery of the relationship between syphilis in early adult- hood and the development of general paralysis of the insane in middle age was due in part to the long separation in time between cause and effect. Further, many persons with syphilis apparently re- covered from their disease and never developed general paralysis. Also, many persons developed paralyses without developing the mental symptoms of paresis. It was so confusing! One widely held explanation of general paralysis linked it to frequent minor trauma to the central nervous system because it was so common in traveling salesmen who had to ride the hard seats of railway cars for thousands of miles each year, while the condition was remark- ably absent in clergymen who ordinarily stayed close to home and were not subject to such spine- jarring experiences!
Some of our current clinical hypotheses may sound as ludicrous in another hundred years. But T would argue that the truly significant relation- ships explaining most psychological disorders will still be discovered to be those between early trau- matic conditioning and subsequent adult instru- mental acts to avoid the effects of such early painful conditioning. Harry Harlow has given us a clear-cut paradigm from the animal laboratory, and Bruno Bettelheim has provided a rough clin- ical example with schizophrenic children. Much research in this area does not have the methodo- logical purity to satisfy the experimentalists. While both the scientists and the professionals are con- cerned with discovering regularities in nature, the scientist, particularly the experimentalist, can choose more powerful methods of demonstrating such regularities. Experiments that impose strict control on the operation of independent variables often lead quickly to the identification of signifi- cant relationships. The discovery of regularities in nature is accelerated in psychological labs where pure strains of laboratory animals are available, destruction of cortical tissue can be accomplished, and extreme conditions of stress, sensory depriva-
tion, infantile trauma, and similar drastic manipula- tions are scientifically acceptable and practical.
On the other hand, the professional, dealing with human lives, is thus restrained by humane and
ethical considerations that frequently prohibit such manipulation of experimental variables. The cli- nician, including the clinical psychologist, often must engage in life-history research rather than experimentation. Any student of research design knows the pitfalls and complexities of such meth- ods, particularly when causes and effects are sepa- rated by long periods of time. The discovery of significant relationships is difficult and uncertain. As a result, clinical psychologists are often the recipients of scornful criticism from experimental psychologists because of the flabbiness of their concepts, the looseness of their hypotheses, and the unreliability of their procedures. In a field that accords its highest status to its scientists, the pro- fessionals are again second-class and disadvantaged.
There are those scientists who would, if they could, impose a moratorium on professional activi- ties in psychology "until we know more about the causes of deviant behavior." Even in clinical re- search, the more "rigorous" approach (Spence's Type IV laws seeking relationships between organic substrata and behavior) has higher status than the investigation of Type II laws (relating early experi- ence and behavior), because the experimental or empirical operations are neater, more direct, and more acceptable.
Additional sources of friction and polarization emerging within psychology today involve questions about the appropriateness of lobbying and social action. Some of this activity is meant to improve the economic position of the clinician, as in the case of health insurance coverage. Other efforts are proposed to influence the public, through APA pronouncements, on a range of issues varying from abortion laws and sexism to Vietnam and popula- tion control. In general, most scientists in APA take the position that they should engage in politi- cal activities as citizens but rarely in the name of psychology. Professionals, on the other hand, have a long history of expressing opinions on issues having direct or indirect consequences for the pro- fession, often in the absence of thoroughgoing knowledge and consensus. Professionals are pre- pared to testify, to speak out, to pass resolutions, on matters that they regard as destructive to the human condition, or not in their own or the public interest. Professionals do indeed act more godlike, echoing another difference between science and pro- fession. The scientist wants to examine all of the evidence before he takes a stand in a controversy.
￼away from committing himself prematurely. The professional, in contrast, is accustomed to making decisions on the basis of incomplete or even scanty evidence—he may be accustomed also to making judgments in life-and-death matters where he has only small odds that he is right. He acts in the best interests, he hopes, of the human condition in the absence of scientific certainty.
Among other professions, for example, social work has passed resolutions on a wide range of social, national, and international problems, and the American Medical Association has relinquished its tax-exempt status in order to participate actively in attempts at influencing legislation—in opposing programs like social security, medicare, health insurance, etc. The National Education Associa- tion lobbies actively for teachers' benefits. The sciences, on the other hand, are less inclined to speak out on social issues except where science itself is directly threatened. What is chemistry's position on abortion? What does mathematics have to say about pollution of the environment?
The Board of Directors further considered this matter at its midsummer meeting in 1969 in Boston and adopted a statement which said, among other things, that APA could take no official stand affirming or denying the validity of any scientific hypothesis.
The cumulative weight of these positions makes APA's response to social issues relatively limited and further polarizes the professionals. Thus, for example, the Association might work energetically to obtain an increase in training and research funds for psychology from federal agencies, or it might take an active role in arguing against the restriction of the use of psychological tests and research. It might prepare a position paper on the comprehen- sive community health centers program. But it would not take a stand on the conclusions of the Kerner Report, nor on the war in Southeast Asia. While it is likely that a majority of psychologists personally agree with the conclusions of the Kerner Report, and would oppose the war, these are not matters of particular and special relevance to the field of psychology in its scientific functions. Many

He is willing to permit any and all hypotheses a professional matters, and a limited range of ap- hearing, and he is used to postponing decisions on propriate activities in the general area of social their validity until more evidence is in. He shies problems.
The social sciences are less inhibited in these areas
than the natural sciences. The national social professionals feel otherwise and mutter about the
science societies most closely involved in the study of human behavior and social phenomena have had experience with disruptive tactics from their stu- dents and younger members who are impatient with the conservatism of the "Establishment." The anthropologists, sociologists, political scientists, and psychologists have had their meetings disrupted for two or three years. So have the social workers and psychiatrists. Such confrontation has led to posi- tion papers and resolutions on social issues. But there has been less of this sort of activism among the harder sciences.
Psychology has had to agonize for several years over policy questions involving public affairs. Should American psychology speak out on the war, on racism? The ad hoc Committee on Public Affairs, chaired by Leona Tyler (1969), wrestled with these issues and concluded that the Board of Directors should assume full responsibility in the area of public affairs. The Tyler Committee de- veloped some guidelines for decisions about ap- propriate action. Briefly, it suggested a wide range of possible association action for scientific matters, a somewhat restricted range of possible actions for
Establishment in psychology and seek to politicize APA, change its governance structure and its tax status.
The activist also may point to the statement in the Tyler Report (1969) which suggests that mobilization of APA to obtain governmental policy changes "would be made only rarely, in cases where the legislation or policy threatened the continued existence or progress of psychology as a field of knowledge [p. 3]." Is there not evidence, asks the activist, that war, racism, and population growth may indeed threaten the continuing exis- tence of our American society? Serious observers, such as John Gardner, warn that the nation is in real danger of disintegration. If the nation deterio- rates, psychology will be among the first whose existence is threatened. Tyrants and totalitarians are not normally supportive of free scientific re- search, and particularly of free inquiry into human problems. So it might be argued that we live in a time when the very existence of psychology is threatened because the existence of our democratic society is threatened and therefore that it is im- portant that psychology throw its resources into

Professional schools for medicare and other health legislation, and the social

What are the future paths open to clinical psychology?
The first, logically, is the perpetuation of the
scientist professional model, with little or no change
in the traditional pattern of training as it has been
developed since it was established at Boulder and fessional psychologists in the community for reaffirmed at every subsequent training conference.
Under this model, the production of PhDs in clin- ical psychology took a leap in the early 1950s so that by the end of the 1960s as many clinical psychology PhDs had been produced as PhDs in experimental, comparative, and physiological psychology com- bined. American universities continue to produce PhDs in clinical psychology numbering about one- third of the total production of doctorates. But it is precisely this model which has been the source of many of the problems that I have pointed to. I do not believe it will survive much longer. There will be attempts to strengthen the scientific aspects of the model—to develop "experimental psycho- pathology" programs—but these will not be likely lo attract the students now seeking training or to
part-time teaching and supervision. The Chicago Conference on Professional Training very strongly recommended that graduate programs in clinical psychology appoint experienced clinicians to the teaching faculty, and, further, that clinical skills should be rewarded in the same way as research publications and teaching. Theserecommendations [ailed to take into account the realities of graduate education—the manner in which points toward promotion and tenure of faculty are accumulated. A professional school, on the other hand, can reward clinical excellence without the approval of graduate school scholars from nonprofessional areas.
There is little question that separate professional schools of psychology will produce primarily doc- toral level clinicians. Psychology's recent history,
these may succeed for a time until the problems of faculty status of professional people and appro- priateness of practicum settings catch up.
A second road for clinical psychology would be the attempt to establish separate professional pro- grams or professional schools of psychology. This alternative has much to recommend it for reasons already examined, and would gain for psychology the benefits of independence from arts and sciences graduate departments and deans, and from un- sympathetic experimental traditionalists within our own field. Industrial psychology has already begun to move its graduate programs out of the arts and sciences faculty and into schools of business ad- ministration and schools of management. Separate professional schools of clinical psychology are being proposed energetically by the National Council on Graduate Education in Psychology. One such school is already being developed by the California
psychology could train far more people than can be accommodated in PhD programs where lan- guages, dissertations, and other requirements slow down the rate of production. Professional schools can recruit from the very large number of young people motivated toward service careers.
Still another advantage of the separate profes- sional school would be that it would draw on pro-
￼its status needs, and the already established state legislative programs for licensing and certification all would require that the graduates of professional schools be people at the doctoral level. But pro- fessional schools could also produce psychological technical specialists at lesser degree levels, some- thing that graduate programs have not been able to do.
The biggest barrier to the establishment of sepa- rate professional schools is the enormous expense— including the expense of psychological centers. This may be a barrier so formidable as to be impassable.
A third path for clinical psychology is a new major alliance with another profession that already owns a professional school with the practicum- training facilities that professional psychology has so desperately lacked for so long. I have been saying for years that as a profession exists to pro- vide services to the surrounding society, such services must be provided in some sort of institu- tion or institutionalized setting owned by the pro- fession. Medicine and surgery have offices and hospitals, and social work has settlement houses and social agencies, and library science has libra- ries, and dentistry has private offices, and educa- tion has schools. In all of these professions, the neophyte, after receiving thorough preparation in the theory, private language, and secret knowledge of his discipline, is sent for apprenticeship to one of these captive institutions, where he learns the skills of the profession and where he is further shaped in his professional role by experienced members of the profession.
Psychology has never possessed such a captive practicum training facility. For a time I thought that psychological centers were the answer for pro- fessional psychology. But I failed to recognize that a graduate school in an arts and sciences faculty cannot or will not operate such a center. We have little experience in providing direct clin- ical services to the public, and we have no deans or administrators who understand the need for such services as part of the training of our young professionals. Nor do our scientific colleagues understand this need.
Ideally, such centers should properly be part of separate and independent professional schools of psychology. But in the interim, they could also belong to someone else. We could join forces with another profession and thereby move our training
out of the inhospitable environment of the gradu- ate school department.
The programs could be located in medical schools. While I find this idea distasteful for many of the reasons examined above, we must at least consider the possibility of moving clinical psychology programs into departments of medical psychology or psychiatry. Another similar pos- sibility would be for clinical psychology to form an alliance with schools of social work or with schools of education.
We could exchange the teaching of behavioral science courses increasingly demanded by these ser- vice professions for permission to use their inter- vention resources and practicum facilities for the preparation of our own professional students. We could teach personality theory, learning theory, psy- chopathology, and research methods to medical students, or social work students, or education stu- dents, and train our own doctoral students in hospitals, settlement houses, or schools now con- trolled by one of these professions.
Because I feel that we can never win equality in a struggle with psychiatry and medicine, I favor an alliance with social work or education. We might work out a much happier symbiotic arrange- ment with one or both of these fields, and we would gain the administrative structure and the practicum facilities for professional training of our own.
A fourth alternative would be to take the drastic step of abandoning clinical psychology as a sepa- rate field. This would be a logical response to the possibly insoluble problems of training clinical psychologists in graduate schools, and the equally difficult problems of establishing either separate pro- fessional schools or new alliances with old profes- sions. This last alternative would suggest that graduate departments return to their historic role of preparing scholars and scientists to do the basic research and the teaching of knowledge that will be applied by other professional fields. Learning theory, personality theory, measurement theory, etc., would be given away to existing nonpsychology professions. Psychology would become a basic science for the profession of nursing, education, social work, medicine, and perhaps for new pro- fessions such as child-care and social welfare. Students seeking service careers in psychology would be steered into other fields. This solution is probably the least palatable to existing clinical psychologists, and perhaps the most attractive to
UNCERTAIN FUTUKE OF CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGY 1079
￼1080 AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGIST
many psychological scientists. In terms of cold reality, it may turn out to be the most probable solution.
As the hand of psychological science controls the intake valve on aspiring professionals coming into our graduate schools, and as the more prestigi- ous departments cut off,or drastically reduce, the size of the flow into their clinical programs, or as these programs are changed into "experimental psychopathology" programs, and as the new schools of psychology fail to flourish because of the thin economic soil in which they are planted, we may witness the gradual disappearance of clinical psychology.
In any event, clinical psychology is going to disappear from the marketplace for a period of years. We are producing about SOO PhDs a year in clinical psychology in the United States, and with half of this number now taking academic jobs or postdoctoral fellowships, the number of clinical psy- chologists available for clinical work in traditional settings is so small as to be inconsequential.
Still another factor adds to the probability that clinical psychologists will disappear from view. This is the impending shortage of academicians in psychology that will lure clinical PhDs into teaching.
The National Education Association reports that college professors are lost, through retirement, death, or for other reasons, at a rate of approxi- mately 5% a year. This means that the productive life of the college teacher, all factors considered, averages about 20 years. (The average age of receipt of the PhD in psychology is 30.)
But psychology has had a far smaller rate of loss. Among academic disciplines, psychology has been a relatively young field. Most present aca- demic psychologists entered the field of college teaching after World War II, and so college teachers of psychology are younger than college teachers of English, history, or physical education. In addi-
tion, psychology is increasingly popular as an undergraduate subject, and so we have added young faculty to teach it. In undergraduate enrollment,
we have moved from an obscure twentieth place before World War II to position Number 1 today. Psychology professors have been young and numer- ous. But now we are entering a new decade, 20 years past the time when psychology took its great leap forward. I predict that our replacement need for college professors will take a substantial leap very soon. While much has been written in the popular press about the glut of scientists in the academic world, this situation clearly does not ap- ply to psychology. Very soon we will witness a large-scale scramble for new psychology teachers as replacements for retirees. It will come first from
the four-year liberal arts colleges where, as a gen- eral rule, college faculty members are older than in the universities. The frequent suggestion that graduate departments cut back on the production of psychologists, is based on a misreading of what is going to happen in academic psychology.
In summary, clinical psychology, as we have known it during the past 25 years, is unlikely to continue unchanged. I have tried to suggest some of the forces I see operating in the field that will influence its future. My feeling is that we will see a growing cleavage between scientific and professional psychology, that there will be an expansion of clinical training somewhere outside the graduate department, probably in separate profes- sional schools. Finding the roles of scientist and of professional incompatible when existing within the same individual does not mean that scientists and professionals do not need each other. The two
groups must exist in a mutually rewarding and symbiotic relationship. I feel that both science and profession will benefit from the impending division, and psychology can truly move forward in both areas as a means of promoting human welfare.
