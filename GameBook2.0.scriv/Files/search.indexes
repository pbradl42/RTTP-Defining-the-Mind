            <Text>## George W. Albee, PhD
### Your Biography
You are George W. Albee, Clinical Psychologist and thorn in the side of Psychiatry. You were born in St. Mary's PA, but attended Bethany College in WV as an undergraduate.  You served in the Air Force from 1943-1946, after which you started graduate school in Clinical Psychology at the University of Pittsburgh. After receiving your PhD in 1949, you joined the Western Psychiatric Institute as a Research Associate, where you worked until 1951.

In 1951, you joined Harry Harlow's wife and two others as the staff of the APA. During that time, not only did you come to understand the inner workings of this vast organization, but you actually drafted some of the committee structures.  In 1953, you won a Fulbright grant to spend a year teaching Psychiatry at Helsinki University, Finland. When you returned to the States in 1954, you accepted an  associate professorship at Western Reserve University in Cleveland, where you still teach.

In the 1950s, you chaired an APA taskforce on resources available for mental health professionals. This taskforce culminated in your Mental Health Manpower Trends (1959), which made clear the need for proactive, preventative mental health needs rather than the traditional reactive psychoanalytic approach.

Your service to the APA is nothing short of astonishing. In the words of a close friend:

&gt;“He served at various times as program chair of the APA annual convention; as a participant in the Miami, Chicago, Vail, and Utah clinical training conferences; as a member of the Board of Professional Affairs and the Ethics Committee; and (on numerous occasions) as a member of the Council of Representatives. He was president of Division 12 (Clinical) in 1966—1967 and [item removed for game coherence]. He has also served on and chaired innumerable APA committees, including the Commission on the Composition of Council that established the current voting system that guarantees one vote per person. “

In 1964, you wrote “A declaration of independence for psychology,” which called for psychologists to withdraw from psychiatric facilities and set up their own centers for treatment of individuals with mental problems.  More recently, you have started worrying publicly that the ‘medical model’ of mental life in terms of ‘health’ and ‘illness’ is lacking. Your 1969 paper “Emerging concepts of mental illness and models of treatment: The psychological point of view” articulates your view on this matter. Roughly, the ‘sickness model’ assumes three things that are not true of mental disturbances or disturbed behavior: (1) that mental conditions are separate, discrete mental illnesses each of which has a separate cause, prognosis and treatment, (2) that treatment of these conditions is the sole responsibility of a specially trained ‘physician’ and (3) that the source of the disturbances are to be found in the individual, rather than in the world, thus focusing all ‘treatment’ effort on the individual rather than the social conditions which may give rise to his or her disturbed behavior.

Your life-long commitment to preventative therapy has caused you to butt heads with defenders of the older way of doing things on various occasions. Your work is typified by three basic trends: (1) the independence of psychology from psychiatry and biology, (2) the inappropriateness of the illness model for mental and emotional disorders, and (3) the role of social injustice and inequality in mental health—both in how social injustice causes mental and emotional disorders and how prejudices have formed mental health taxonomies and diagnostics.

According to you, mediating factors such as social support, self-esteem and healthy coping skills have a more profound effect on the incidence of mental and emotional disorders than any conceivable trauma, defense mechanism, or reaction. Echoing the medical truism that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure, you believe that stamping out racism, sexism, ageism and homophobia (as well as other prejudices) would do more to alleviate mental and emotional disorders than all the psychoanalysis that all the psychoanalysts could possibly provide.

 In your own words, the 1960s found you embroiled in a “continuing, often acrimonious debate with psychiatry over the inappropriateness of the illness model of mental and emotional disorder and over medical hegemony.”

### Game Objectives
Find opportunities to articulate and promote your vision of psychology as an alternative to psychiatry, including the importance of preventative treatment. One obvious way to do this is to run for president as soon as possible. If you are unable to be elected president, seek a paper presentation during which you can present your vision of preventative mental health.

If and when the game gets to the point where the definition of mental illness is addressed, work with Thomas Szasz to ensure that no definition that assumes an ‘illness’ metaphor or medical model, or makes a tacit preference for psychiatry against psychology.

#### Specific Assignment
If you class is larger than 16, you'll start as the board-member-at-large, serving from '71-'73.

Organize a symposium with Thomas Szasz on the suitability of the medical model for psychiatric treatment.  This will be best in 1972 before the debate on the DSM-III is taking place.

There will likely be a proposal to limit the treatment of mentally disordered patients to psychiatrists, you should not only fight against it, but propose a separate system of treatment run entirely by psychologists.  Your proposal should call for the establishment of various centers that would train, certify and deliver mental health services, in competition with psychiatry.  Check out 'Ethical Standards' item 7.i, which was added in 1968.

You will need to provide guidance and support to Robert Spitzer, as his task force attempts to write its report. At the same time, you are a strong ally of those trying to get homosexuality removed from the DSM.

This activity does not require prior knowledge of psychology. There is little advance preparation, and it is suitable for c/asses of virtually any size. You will need to give some thought to how you will instruct the
"experimenter(s)" in the procedures without informing the learnels) during this in-class exercise.
CotlctPr
Human operant conditioning is often demonstrated by asking the subject to say nouns and then rein{orcing the plural but not the singular form. Another technique is to ask the subject to say numbers and then reinforce those numbers divisible by 2. The short- coming of these procedures is that the subject is limited by the instructions to two classes of responses, whereas the animal in the typical Skinner box can make many more different responses even if the space is limited. In addition, the procedures do not display shaping of the response by successive approximation, and as a consequence, there are no changes in the criteria for reinforcement that are present in shaping. Moteover, during extinction, one cannot watch the behavior revert to previously re- warded responses. These shortcomings can be minimized by doing the activity out-
lined here.
No materials are required except pencil and paper. Score sheets must be constructed by those doing the rein{orcing.
Twelve words are shown to the subject, and his or her instructions are simply to try to get as many points as possible. He or she is to say the word, and following the word the experimenter will say either "Point" or "No point." The experimenter should record which word was given and whether a reinforcement was given for each trial. The words to be used are underfed, misread, understand, underctudy, mistake, mistead, underctanding, mistaken, underpaid, underctandingly, misinform, and mistakenly.
The experimenter first reinJorces any word that begins with "mis," by saying "Point." Once the subject has picked three words in succession that begin with the syllable "mis" and received three reinforcements in succession, the experimenter should change the criterion so that-rein{orcement is received only if the first two syilables "mistake . ." ate chosen., Again, after the subject has received three rein- forcements in succession, the criterion is changed so that only the word with the three syllables "mistaken . ." is reinforced. AJter three more successive reinforcements/ only the word "mistakenly" is reinJorced. After five correct responses in succession, the reinforcement is no longer given for any word, thus beginning the extinction proc- ess. The extinction session should last at least three minutes.
LEARNING AND MEMORY r67
Mlrrntlls Nrroro
lxstnucrrors
 Drscussrol
The students can work in pairs, with one as the subject and one as the erperi- menter, or one student can be used to demonstrate the phenomena. Ask the subiect to pick his or her words by number, because that will facilitate recording the responses. Ir order to draw a cumulative response cunre, it is necessary to have someone record how many cofiect responses occur in each 3-minute period.
Once the cumulative response eurves for acquisition and extinction have been drawn, have students make observations on the rate of responding (indicated by the slopet. You might dsk them to try to specify what a reacquisition curve might look like or.a curve showing spontaneorii' recovery. If a number of subiects are conditioned then individual differences in rate will occur, so you may wish to ask what is it about the behavior in the situation that might account for such individual differences. The re- gression back through previously reinforced responses that is often observed in ani- mals may also occur. Ask the class how such behavior-going back through previously reinforced responses-might be adaptive for an animal in its natural environment.

### Your Biography
You were born in New York, daughter of Italian immigrants, in 1908. Your father died when you were 1, after which your mother was alienated from your father's family. Since your mother had to work, you were raised primarily by your maternal grandmother and your uncle.  You were home-schooled until the age of 9. As a teenager, you became interested in mathematics, teaching yourself advanced trigonometry. At 13, you dropped out of high school and enrolled in Rhodes Preparatory School, whose primary mission is to train adults who needed basic eduction to get accepted in college.  After two years at Rhodes, you were accepted at Barnard College at the age of 15.

At Barnard, you were deeply influenced by Harry Hollingworth, chair of the Psychology department, as well as the work of Charles Spearman, an English statistician and psychologist who demonstrated that scores on most tests of mental abilities were correlated with one another, suggesting that there was a single general source of intelligence (see Spearman (1904)). You graduated from Barnard at 4 years later at 19, and were granted a PhD By Columbia one year later in 1929.

The year that you earned your doctorate, the stock market crashed, which caused the early part of your career to be defined by harsh economic times. Thanks to New Deal grants from the National Youth Administration and the Works Progress Administration (WPA), you were able to hire a few research assistants. You moved to Queens College in 1939, but felt that the administration did not fully support your fledgling psychology department. You moved again, this time to Fordham, in 1947, where you remain today.

You are often called the “test guru.'' Your 1954 text, ''Psychological Testing,'' is still required reading in undergraduate and graduate psychology courses and is considered a virtual bible for the field. The book, an encyclopedic review of how tests are constructed, validated and interpreted, received wide acclaim for its lucidity and depth of analysis. You took a special interest in the question of whether tests could be created that were free of cultural bias.  In the 1960's and 70's, while some in the field championed so-called ''culture fair'' tests, your argued that the claim that tests could be entirely unbiased was a fallacy. You ultimately argued that, “Tests can serve a predictive function only insofar as they indicate to what extent the individual has acquired the prerequisite skills and knowledge for a designated criterion performance. What persons can accomplish in the future depends not only on their present intellectual status, as assessed by the test, but on their subsequent experience (Anastasi, 1981).”

According to you, intelligence tests can do three things:

	&gt;“They permit a direct assessment of prerequisite intellectual skills demanded by many important tasks in our culture.
&gt;They assess availability of a relevant store of knowledge or content also prerequisite for many educational and occupational tasks.
&gt;They provide an indirect index of the extent to which the individual has developed effective learning strategies, problem-solving techniques and work habits and utilized them in the past.” (quoted on http://www.indiana.edu/~intell/anastasi.shtml from Anastasi, 1981).

You wrote that, "Intelligence is not a single, unitary ability, but rather a composite of several functions. The term denotes that combination of abilities required for survival and advancement within a particular culture (Anastasi, 1992, p. 613). ” Your research focused on understanding and measuring the factors underlying the development of individual differences in psychological traits (Anastasi, 1972, 1989). You argued against the strictly hereditarian position, emphasizing the role of experiential and environmental influences on intelligence test scores and psychological development. You stressed that intelligence test scores are not pure measures of innate ability, but that “...not only does the nature of one's antecedent experiences affect the degree of differentiation of "intelligence" into distinct abilities, but it also affects the particular abilities that emerge, such as verbal, numerical, and spatial abilities. Thus, experiential factors affect not only the level of the individual's intellectual development, but also the very categories in terms of which his abilities may be identified (Anastasi, 1972).”

In addition to your contributions to testing, you were renowned for your studies of individual and group differences and the interplay of biology and environment in shaping personality and intellectual development. You wrote more than 150 scholarly books, monographs and articles, and are said to have brought to the issue a balanced, deeply rational perspective and an insistence on solid science. You played a significant role in applying psychology to real-world situations, both through areas like industrial psychology and consumer psychology and in the clinical consulting room.

### Game Objectives
Run for vice president in 1972, or until you get elected. Your expertise in statistics and understanding variability may come in very handy in the discussion of the 'normality' of sexual behavior.  You wish to present paper on the topic in 1972 or 1973.

If you are elected to a leadership position, it will be important to leave a legacy that can assist other women who wish to attain positions of such stature.  At the same time, you are crucially aware of the lack of serious research in either the psychological or psychiatric communities on the minds of women. Where women have been separated out for special study, the work is poor and misogynistic.  As president, then, you will be keenly interested in establishing institutional infrastructure that will both advance the study of women in a non-misogynistic way and provide leadership opportunities for future women in the discipline.

Notice that the official documents of the APA, as included in the game book, are written in gender-specific language: I.B states “a nonmember of the APA may read a paper provided that he is sponsored...”. The implication here is, of course, that a female nonmember is not allowed to present. As this document is an official representation of the policies of the APA, it should be clarified to reflect the policies of the organization.

You are neutral on the definition of mental illness. 

#### Specific Assignments
You are an initial member of the Program committee, with your term expiring in 1973. Review the model schedule in the gamebook, and solicit proposals from your peers. You should also get the program committee to propose gender-neutral language for the guidelines, and present your proposal to the board in 1971. 

Create two new standing committees of the APA: The Committee on Women in Psychology, which will focus on the issues facing women in the profession, and The Committee on the Psychology of Women, which will focus on studying women's minds as a specialization within the discipline.  From the current website of the committee on women in psychology:

Specifically, the committee will undertake the following priority tasks
(a) collection of information and documentation concerning the status of women;
(b) development of recommendations relevant to women;
(c) monitoring the implementation of guidelines and recommendations from reports issued by APA that are relevant to women;
(d) development of mechanisms to increase the participation of women in roles and functions both within and outside the profession;
(e) ongoing communications with other agencies and institutions regarding the status of women; and
(f) monitoring current issues relevant to the lives of women in order to inform policy.
The Committee shall consist of six members who are elected for staggered terms of three years.  It shall report to Council through the Board for the Advancement of Psychology in the Public Interest (BAPPI). (Approved by Council, February 2008)
Strategic Goals
Goal I  Promoting the health and well-being of women
Goal II  Identifying and eliminating discriminatory practices against women
Goal III Increasing the visibility of feminist scholarship and practice
Goal IV Promoting the unique contributions of women to psychology
Goal V  Enhancing women’s leadership within and outside of APA
Goal VI Collaborating with others as needed to achieve the empowerment of underrepresented groups
Goal VII Promoting the generation and communication of knowledge about women’s lives

And Division 35: the Society for the Psychology of Women:
&gt; Division 35: Society for the Psychology of Women provides an organizational base for all feminists, women and men of all national origins, who are interested in teaching, research, or practice in the psychology of women. The division recognizes a diversity of women's experiences which result from a variety of factors, including ethnicity, culture, language, socioeconomic status, age, and sexual orientation. The division promotes feminist research, theories, education, and practice toward understanding and improving the lives of girls and women in all their diversities; encourages scholarship on the social construction of gender relations across multicultural contexts; applies its scholarship to transforming the knowledge base of psychology; advocates action toward public policies that advance equality and social justice; and seeks to empower women in community, national, and global leadership. We welcome student members and affiliates. Members are provided two publications: Psychology of Women Quarterly, which is a journal of research, theory, and reviews, and the Feminist Psychologist.

Present a paper outlining psychometrics and the use of statistical measures in psychology. This should be connected, conceptually, to the problem of the the taxonomy of mental disorders. It is a good idea, then, to wait until after Spitzer presents the Feigner criteria in 1972. If elected president, it can be your presidential address. If not, it should be a regular paper.

Students develop hands-on skills in problem formulation, classification of disorders, developing treatment plans, and assessing the prognoses of actual or simulated clients in this exercise. Although a.film or video presentation of a clinical interview works best,.you can do this activity with an audiotaped interview or even a written history. The simulation procedure generally should be introduced 4 to 5 weeks into the course, after
students have been prepared in the background they will need to engage lin this miniclinic assessrnent exercise. A full class session for the actual presentation of the interview, the assessment, and ensuing
discussion is recommended. The student worksheets for completing the assessrnent are provided.
Corucrpt
Many notable teachers of psychology, textbook authors, and practicing psychologists (Beniamin &amp; Lowman, 1981, McKeachie,I9TSi Radford 8L Rose, I980| have im- plored professors to give undergraduate students the experience of actually working at the tasks that psychologists perform. In many undergraduate lecture courses, students become oriented to what clinicians do and may even observe audiotaped or videotaped examples of clinical activities. Yet, because of ethical concerns (e.g., confidentiality problems, using untrained students to make interventions or impor- tant decisions regarding a client) or the sheer numbers of students involved, psychol- ogy students are rarely directed to-attempt the hands-on exercise of clinical skills. When students are tested in abnormal psychology courses, they are often expected to make diagnostic decisions, provide a prognosis, and define the relevance of particu- lar forms of therapy for different disorders-all based on fragments of hypothetical cases, often presented in the form of multiple-choice items. This article describes a method that involves students in the relevant simulation of a variety of clinical experiences. We have employed these techniques or "miniclinics" in several courses that contain units related to clinical assessment and intervention (e.g. abnormal,
child development, and introductory psychology courses).
Besides the three student worksheets that are replicated here, the most important element of the miniclinic exercise is the case material presented by the instructor- ideally, written background information and films or videotapes. Satisfactory but less revealing and stimulating for discussion are written case histories.
Recently, there has been an increase in both the quality and the selection of clinical vignettes {both actual and simulated productions). These are often available from book publishers for a small fee or at no charge to instructors who have adopted the publisher's text book in abnormal psychology.
The film catalogues of colleges and universities are another excellent source of such material. The film "Otto-A Case Study in Abnormal Behavior" (Film No. ECl404, l6; available from the Audio-Visual Center, Indiana University, Bloom- ington, IN 47405-5901) features a case enactment designed to be studied from the

basic models of psychopathology and treatment. This fine fiim mav he ^.r^_ separately or in a series o? fil*, dlsphying various representat;;;;r;:Jil:[: the hypothetical Otro from their own model of therapy.
The paper-and-pencil materials include three worksheers: (a) Intake and prob- lem Formulation, (bl DSM-III classification, and (c) Treatment plan and Prognosis. These forms should be reproduced for each student.
Undergraduate students are assigned at random to one of several ,,clinic,, groups representing a model or school of psychopathology (e.g., psychoanalytic, behalvioral, client-centered, existential, biological). we harr" iorrrJ thargroups of 6-t0 sruden$ function effectively for these- exercises. During the course of the semester, as
are convened, students are rot'ated to other models. This procedure ensures "tini., that each
student is exposed to the full complement of therapeutic approaches and helps each student develop ease of communication with other members of the class.
The clinic simulation procedure is generally introduced approximately 4 or 5 weeks into the semester. This timing permits the instructor to cover, in standard sequence/ introductory chapters on abnormal psychology, the various models or approaches to psychopathology, the chapters on classification and assessment pro- cedures, and at least one content chapter focusing on the disorders themselves. There chapters are usually followed by material covering the remaining cliagnostic catego- ries- The experienced instructor will frequently find that most textbooks follow tLis fairly standard sequence.
Critical to the success of the exercise is the effective introduction of the material in chapters about models of psychopathology and the Diagnostic and. Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Third Edition (DSM-III;American psychiatric Associa- tion, 1980)' When these chapters are taught (and they should be introduced early in the coursef , it is important to prepare the students for the eventual clinic exercise by demonstrating how a case can be viewed by the various models, regardless of the diagnosis agreed upon from the DSM-III. For example, depression can be viewed as
resulting from a chemical imbalance, from a reduction in reinforcement, or from a symbolic loss accentuated by a fixation in the oral stage of development. Thus, before students are actually given the clinic assignment, it is imporianr that they have understood to some degree the ideas behind the various models, the nature of the classification system, and at least one area of disorders outlined in the DSM-\il,
Tirne requirements for the exercise vary with the depth of each instructor's involvement with the procedure. For example, some instructors may not wish to have the clinic groups complete each form for each case presented. However, aker the stimulus case has been presented, at least 30 minutes of discussion and process' ing should be made available for the groups. Additional time for a general review of each group's findings, a discussion of agreement within and among groups, and a
presentation of new material by the instructor is needed. fo, thoroug=h-processing of the exercise, a full hour should be allotted. Group discussion ,.rd ti" irocessing of information can be carried over from one class session to the next. However,wehave found the process to be smoother when the entire exercise is completed within one class session. Problems of absenteeism/ retention of the case matJrial, and so forth are minimized when closure is achieved within one crass period.
Students in each of the miniclinics are presented with an overview of the natlJt,e of the learning task. prior to the acrual presentation of case -r;;;i;;;.rJ.nrc ineach clinic are reminded of the particular concerns and variables relevant to their discr

pline. The psychoanalytical group is, for example, cued to look for important fea- tures of early childhood, for current defense mechanisms employed, and for the possible forms that an eventual transference might take. Simiiar coaching is directed toward members of other miniclinics. These instructions are provided to students in a general session so students can become further aware of the di.fferentiation in task and approach of the various therapeutic schools.
When clinic assignments and the general review have been completed, the full case presentation is made, starting with background information provided by the instructor. Each group also receives a copy of the written case history. it is helpful to select cases with a good deal of background information so that students from each clinic have enough potential information to make a case for the relevance or efficacy of their mode. After the background information is presented, the recording of the case is played. Next, students divide into clinic groups to discuss the case and to complete the paper-and-pencil assignments. While the students are working in their groups, it is helpful for the instructor to interact with each group in progress.
The paper-and-pencil assignments consist of three worksheets: Intake and Problem Formulation, DSM-III Classification, and Treatment Plan and Prognosis. Students are instructed to tailor their observations to their assigned perspective on the Intake and Problem Formulation Worksheet. For example, under the Historical Antecedent section, behaviorists are encouraged to note possible early learning his- tories, psychoanalysts are told to report possible developmental trauma, and stu- dents in the physiological clinic are directed to focus on possible early signs of neurological disorder, brain iniury, congenital problem, and so forth. Each student is required to complete this form, although group discussion may take place before each student has completed the assignment.
The DSM-III worksheet requires students in each of the clinics to review all five axes of the DSM-/IL Of course, students are informed that they will rarely utilize all axes in classifuing a case. As with the intake and Problem Formulation Worksheet, each student is required to complete a form after group discussion. Students are encouraged to stick to their guns even if others in the clinic disagree. Because of this practice, reliability estimates may be made for each clinic,
The classification exercise is followed by the completion of the Treatment Plan and Prognosis Worksheet. It is here that students are able to exercise the most creativity and to display familiarity with their assigned model of practice. Interven- tions should be justified on the basis of problem documentation and relevance to the student's particular mode. The prognosis section is also to be completed with refer- ence to the assigned model and with consideration of the available resources and circumstances relevant to the model (e.g., How well would an older adult with an IQ of 7S do in traditional psychoanalysis?).
With the worksheets completed, the full class reassembles to process the results of the exercise. The instructor leads d discussion of each worksheet activity, high- lighting the points of view for each model represented. In addition, a discussion of agreement or disagreement on diagnosis, etiology, and treatment both within and among groups may be held. Rough estimates of percent agreement within groups may be calculated by simply dividing the number of agreements (with the correct diagnostic category) by the combined number of agreements and disagreements within each group. It should be made clear to students, however, that this number is only a rough estimate that is probably inflated because it does not account for the number of agreements that would be expected by chance. It is probably not worth the

time it would take to labor through a complete explanation of the probabilities of chance agreement for each diagnostic category.
The miniclinic method presents several advantages to the instructor as well as a few potential stumbling block6. Advantages include teaching students the rigors of keeping within theoretical models, teaching the logical connection between an etio- logical conception of problems and interventions associated with particular models, and exploring the problem of how models relate (or do not relate| to the current classification system. Finally, students are able to learn clinical material *ittrout rote. They learn that the DSM-II/ is a real tool and enjoy exercising their diagnostic skill through safe risk taking in the miniclinic.
The problems associated with this process include the always-present possibility that passive students will remain passive and let others complete the exercise. The medical students/ disease syndrome and the phenomena of the "instant expert/, can also be stimulated by this activity, yet early warnings and effective feedback in class can do much to prevent these problems.
One final and nontechnical note summarizing the process is in order: Both students and instructors who use this process find it a lot of fun!

Each week (two or three sessions, depending on your schedule) of game play reenacts one annual conference of the APA in the early 1970s.  Thus, the five weeks of game play cover the years 1971-1975. These conferences are huge events. There are presentations on current research, symposia on issues facing the discipline, administrative meetings for various committees, public discussions and votes on proclamations, and publishers promoting their products.

At the beginning of each conference, each member of the APA is given one ‘credibility point.'  At the end of that conference, they must give it to the speaker who presented the best paper.  No player may keep these points for himself or herself. Credibility points, once awarded, can be stockpiled by faction or bartered with other players. In the final vote (see 'Victory Objectives' below), the credibility points can be turned into votes—although the specifics are left to the game master to decide.  

The first session of each conference opens with a presidential address. As mentioned in the previous section, the position of President is both an honorific and administrative position. The President is often elected based on his or her reputation as a researcher, but he or she also must have keen leadership skills and knowledge of the policies and procedures of the organization's committee structure. Since these two areas of expertise do not always appear in the same person, an individual is not elected directly to the presidency by the membership. Rather, the membership holds an annual election for the vice-president, who is then promoted to president after a year of sitting on the Board of Directors and observing the inner workings of the political system.
 
The Board of Directors is composed of the APA President, the Vice president, the former president and two members elected at large each of whom serving three year terms. For classes smaller than 16, the Board of Directors will be limited to the current President, the Vice President and the Former President. The executive secretary, who serves without vote, is responsible for maintaining the minutes of the Board of Directors and taking whatever actions the committee approves during its meetings.

At each year's conference, the following events occur:

&lt;!--\noindent\fbox{%

Game play may take many forms in the classroom. You may be questioning  the President about his or her vision for future directions in psychological or psychiatric research, engaging with or participating in a symposium with two or three of your colleagues on a contentious issue of the day, participating in research, evaluating research results, discussing proposals in committee, or even arguing about reports from task forces.  The schedule of events will be left to the Program Committee, and it is very important that they distribute the schedule early and widely.

            <Text>## Kenneth Clark, PhD
### Your Biography
You are Kenneth Clark, a psychologist, educator, and social reformer dedicated to understanding and eradicating racial injustice.  You grew up in Harlem, attending the integrated schools of NY City, but attended college at Howard University in D.C. There, you met Mamie Phipps, who eventually became your wife, and with whom you authored numerous studies on the psychological damage caused by segregation and racism. You were the first African American to receive a Doctorate in Psychology from Columbia, and the first black permanent professor at City College of New York, where you still teach.
In addition to your excellent academic collaboration with Mamie, together you founded Harlem's Northside Center for Child Development in 1946, with the mission to “fosters the healthy development of children and families and seeks to empower them to respond constructively to negative societal factors including racism and its related consequences. Through comprehensive, high quality mental health and educational services, coupled with research, children and families are aided in developing to their full potential.”
In your most famous study (co-authored with Mamie), you presented four identical plastic dolls that different only with respect to color to black children between the ages of three and seven. When asked which doll they preferred, the majority selected the white doll. When asked to color in a drawing 'the same color' as themselves, most of the black children choose yellow or white crayons.  You concluded that “prejudice, discrimination, and segregation” had caused the children to develop a sense of self-hatred and inferiority.
The study become something of a sensation, and it is still included in most introductory psychology textbooks. It's effects, however, were much more profound that that.
In 1950, You (Kenneth), wrote a summary of the paper for the Midcentury White House Conference on Children and Youth.  The summary was read, ultimately, by Robert Carter, who was one of the NAACP lawyers pushing the various cases challenging segregation that ultimately were consolidated into the pivotal 1954 Brown v. The Board of Education decision.  The NAACP contracted you as an expert witness for at least three cases: Briggs v. Elliot (South Carolina) , Davis v. County School Board of Prince Edward County and Belton v. Gebhart (Delaware). You co-authored the summation that was ultimately endorsed by leading social scientists at the time when it went before the Supreme court.

Writing for a unanimous court, Chief Justice Warren stated

&gt;“Does segregation of children in public schools solely on the basis of race, even though the physical facilities and other "tangible" factors may be equal, deprive the children of the minority group of equal educational opportunities? We believe that it does.”
Quoting from the appellate court (which actually ruled against the NAACP), Chief Justice Warren argued:

&gt; "Segregation of white and colored children in public schools has a detrimental effect upon the colored children. The impact is greater when it has the sanction of the law; for the policy of separating the races is usually interpreted as denoting the inferiority of the negro group. A sense of inferiority affects the motivation of a child to learn. Segregation with the sanction of law, therefore, has a tendency to [retard] the educational and mental development of negro children and to deprive them of some of the benefits they would receive in a racial[ly] integrated school system."  

Whatever may have been the extent of psychological knowledge at the time of Plessy v. Ferguson, this finding is amply supported by modern authority.11  Any language [347 U.S. 483, 495]   in Plessy v. Ferguson contrary to this finding is rejected.

Footnote 11, which supports the central finding of Brown, cites your 1950 memo “Effect of Prejudice and Discrimination on Personality Development.”
In the 1896 case Plessy v. Ferguson, the Supreme court ruled that so long as railroad accommodations were 'separate but equal', the state of Louisiana was allowed to enforce racial segregation.  The court reasoned that laws which kept races separated did not necessarily entail the inferiority of one to the other. Your study was pivotal in the Warren's court rejection of that idea.
Brown v. Board of Education was not only a milestone in the modern civil rights movement, it also made you into something of an academic superstar. You went on to become the most influential black social scientist of your generation. You received honorary degrees from more than a dozen of the nation's finest colleges and universities, but your larger goal of integrated, adequate schooling for blacks had not become a reality even four decades after the announcement of the monumental court decision.
In the 1960s, you helped establish the Harlem Youth Opportunities Unlimited, a project that influenced President Lyndon Johnson's War on Poverty program.
Your many books include Prejudice and Your Child (1955), Dark Ghetto: Dilemmas of Social Power (1965), and The Negro American (1966).  
### Game Objectives
As an initial member of the Research committee, you'll be called upon to judge the scientific legitimacy and ethical acceptability of proposed research programs.  You should make yourself familiar with the sections of the game book titled 'A Primer on Research Methods' and 'Ethics of Human Research'.  Your gamemaster will give you an additional sheet outlining the responsibilities of members of the research committee in evaluating proposals.  In the first year, you are likely to get a proposal to the research committee that proposes an experiment on a child. It is vital that you prompt the committee as a whole to seriously consider the nature of 'consent' in the context of  power dynamics and social inequality.

Oppose the passing of the 'Leona Tyler principle', which states:

&gt;“As citizens, members of the APA have the right to advocate for any cause through the myriad of political advocacy organizations, but when psychologists and psychiatrists speak for the profession through APA public stances and proclamations, it should be from science and professional experience.  
On occasion psychiatrists are asked for an opinion about an individual who is in the light of public attention or who has disclosed information about himself/herself through public media. In such circumstances, a psychiatrist may share with the public his or her expertise about psychiatric issues in general. However, it is unethical for a psychiatrist to offer a professional opinion unless he or she has conducted an examination and has been granted proper authorization for such a statement.”

Get elected president.  That can be before or after your symposium.

You are neutral on the definition of mental illness. 
#### Specific Assignments
Organize, propose and participate in a symposium on the role of psychology as a mechanism of social change or more generally, on the social responsibilities of scientists, preferably in 1973.  Chomsky and Marmor may be a good choices as a co-panelists. You should present a paper on psychology's role for social good. If you are elected president, it should be your presidential address. If not, it can be a part of the symposium.
In 1975, propose an affirmative action plan for psychology and psychiatry. Here's the real language. You should adapt it to your needs:

&gt; THERE IS a continuous need to increase the number of minority psychiatrists; the American Psychiatric Association has consistently demonstrated its commitment to the principle of affirmative action as reflected in its efforts of recruitment and training of minority psychiatrists. APA has previously developed and instituted policies recognizing and supporting the special mental health issues of minority populations; however, there are serious threats to affirmative action programs that have facilitated the following endeavors: APA reaffirms these commitments and policies by 1) issuing a public statement drawing attention to the potential deleterious effects that such threats pose to the delivery of health services to minority groups; 2) actively participating with other professional and educational groups to assure continued recruitment and training of minority candidates in medical disciplines; and 3) further exploring and developing, through its appropriate components, mechanisms to assure continued implementation of these commitments.

This activity is designed for students in research methods and behavior modification classes or the methods section of other content courses. Students observe a brief videotape and collect data on the occurrencdnonoccurrence of a series of six behaviors. The main purposes of this activity are to help students (a) understand the importance of having clear operational definitions, (b) learn to calculate interobserver reliability, and (d think about ways to improve a study that has low interobserver reliability. ln addition, students gain practice in using time sampling and come to realize that observation as a data collection technique is more complex than casual observation.

This exercise heips students realize that observation as a data collection tech- nique is more complex than casual observation. It introduces students to the use of time sampling, the calculation of interobserver reliability, and the importance of having clear operational deftnitions.
You will need a tO-min videotape of human or animal behavior, a VCR and mon- itor for showing the tape to the class, a watch with a second hand, and enough copies of the handouts described later for each student in the class. Students will need pencils and will probably want calcuiators.
To be most effective, the videotape should be of a group of humans or animals that are active enough to produce several different types of behaviors. If at least some of those behaviors occur quite frequently and in several individuals at a time, students will come away with a better understanding of why time sampling is useful. My tape is of a group of white geese at a local park. (I would be happy to provide a copy of this taped segment to anyone who sends me a blank video- tape.) There are many other possibilities for foo-tage that will meet the previously described requirements. For example, you could videotape small children perform- ing at a school program or playing at a birthday pafty, or you could get some footage of one of the livelier species at your local zoo. If you or someone you know is planning to visit another country you may be able to obtain a tape of. festival or other group event from another culture. The videos that some univer- sities make of their graduation ceremonies could also be used. If you have access to a VCR, you could tape a segment of an appropriate televised event. Although
many television programs show groups engaging in behaviors that meet the cri- teria identified at the beginning of this discussion, most do not show this activity, uninterrupted by close-ups of individuals or pans to scenery and other locations

in the story line, for more tban a minute or two. There are exceptions, however, that would make good tapes for this activity: Televised New Year's Eve bashes usually show quite long segments of partyers, sporting events such as basketball or volleyball also show fairly long segments of activity on the court, and dance club shows on cable channels run segments of coupies dancing for the duration of a complete song.
Prepare three handouts. The ffrst should contain a data collection sheet with a row for each observation interval and a column for each behavior students are to record (see appendix A). The second should contain a list of behaviors (I rec- ommend no more than six to eight), their operational definitions {some of which are purposely clearer than others), and a simple formula for inter-rater reliability (see appendix B). The third handout should contain a set of postobsewation ques- tions (see appendix C).
This activity should be prefaced with a lecture on the use of observation tech- niques, including the advantages and disadvantages of time sampiing in relation to other observation techniques (e.g., event sampling and narrative recording) and the concept of interobserver reliability. Although the basic observation techniques described in methods textbooks are much the same, the labels given to particular techniques vary. The following definitions of observation technrques are provided to facilitate gathering background lecture material and to prevent misunderstand- ing.
Time sampling is a technique in which the observer defi.nes several target behaviors, divides the observation period into short intervals, and then alternates from observing to recording every other interval. In contrast, in event sampling the observer deftnes a target behavior and records every instance of that behavior as it occurs throughout the observation period . A narrative recording is a running description of behavior in which everything that is said or done during the ob- servation period is recorded. The following are particularly useful sources for lec- ture material: chapter 5 from Bordens and Abbott 11996l, chapters 5,7, and 8 from Martin and Bateson (1993); and chapter 19 from Martin and Pear (19961.
Give each student all three handouts, and allow them a few minutes to read through the list of behaviors and operational definitions and become familiar with the layout of the data collection sheet. Have students work in 15-s intervals- alternating between 15 s for observing and 15 s for recording observations com- pleted in the previous 15-s interval. For each observation interval, they simply look for whether or not each target behavior occurs. If the behavior occurs at least once in the observation intewal, they are to place a tally mark in the appropriate column on the data sheet during the recording interval. Rather than having stu- dents keep track of their own intervals, use a watch with a second hand to time intervals for them. It works best if you simply call out "observe" or "teeord" at the beginning of alternate lS-s intervals. Explain to students that data collection will last for a total of 10 min. Each minute represents an observation period and is divided into 30-s sessions. During each 30-s session, students will have a 15-s interval to observe the behavior on the videotape and a lS-s intewal to record their observations. It is important for students to understand what they are ob- serving and recording; be sure to explain that they are recording the occurrence of target behaviors. That is, they are looking for whether or not a behavior occuls; they are not looking for the number of times a speciffc behavior occurs.

After 10 min, have students stop observing and work on the postobservation questions {see appendix C). As appendix C illustrates, students will ftrst answer several questions individuall, then compare those answers with a partner, and finally calculate interobserver reliability with their partner for each of the target behaviors.
Follow up with a class discussion of students' responses to the postobservation questions. Focus on those questions where partners' responses differed most often and on those behaviors that had the highest and lowest interobserver reliability. Then discuss possible reasons for these trends. With my tape of geese and set of behaviors, for example, students generally have very high interobserver reliability for displays and for tail shakes and low reliability for feeding and submission. When exploring possible reasons for these findings, student comments tend to focus on the importance of careful operational definitions and on problems with observation. For example, students notice that my operational definition of dis- play behavior is much more concrete than my definition of submission, that the definition for feeding was too narrow to encompass much of what they wanted to be able to code as feeding behavior, and that several of the behaviors were difftcult to identify accurately because of the distance from which the videotape was shot. For example, one student declared that she wanted a better definition of feeding, because "sometimes I thought they might be, but I couldn't see if they really had food in their mouths or not."
Next ask students to offer possible solutions for the reliability problems they have encountered. We talk about clarifying operational definitions. For example, several students decided that "touching beak to the ground several times in a row" would have defined feeding in a way that would have allowed them to record what they thought was feeding behavior. Students also brought up the possibility of reviewing the tape and discussing discrepancies between observers in order to resolve disagreements or practicing with sample tapes to improve reliability be- fore viewing actual data tapes. This second idea was an elaboration on one stu- dent's comment that he "wished we could have watched the whole tape ffrst while reading the definitions and then dane the recording part.'/ The students also decided that the value of a high-power zoom lens should not be underestimated if one wants to observe detailed behaviors and remain unobtrusive. Overall, stu- dents' responses to the activity indicated that not only did they learn a great deal, but that they enjoyed the activity as well.
A minor variation on this activity could allow students to discover for them- selves that one of the pitfalls to time sampling is that there wiil always be lost data (i.e., behaviors that occur during recording intervals rather than observation
) intervals). Instead of having the entire class ijbserve and record during the same I intervals, divide the class in half, and have each half observe and record during I opposite intervals. Have each half of the class pool their data and calculate the I mean number of intervals in which tail shakes, feeding, grooming, display, ag-
t gression, and submission were observed by their group. Students should find that
I
for behaviors that occur frequently, there will be little difference between the means reported by each half of the class. For example, the two halves of the class should be quite similar on mean number of tail shakes, simply because this occurs almost continuously among geese. Horlvever, for relatively infrequent behaviors, such as displays of agglession, students are likely to notice differences between
RESEARcH METHoDS AND srATrsrlcs l59
 Wnrrrruc Cotr,rporuerr
reports by the two halves of the class. This can lead to a discussion of the relative usefulness of time sampling versus event sampling for observing infrequent be- haviors. (Obviously, if you use this alternative procedure and you still want stu- dents to calculate interobserver reliability, they must do so by pairing up with someone from the same half of the class.)
Instructors who want to provide their students with an opportunity to do more writing than the small amount required to complete appendix C may add one of the following writing components to the activity.
l. Have students reflect on their expectations of observation in general and time sampling in particular. AJter giving students a brief description of the exercise they are about to engage in, ask them to respond to the question, "What do you think will happen when we do this time sampling obser- vation?" After the exercise is complete, have students reread their earlier expectations and write a response to the following two questions: (a) "Which of your earlier expectations were met and why do you think this happened?" and (b) "Which of your earlier expectations were not met and why do you think this happened?" As a follow-up, students could construct a list on the chalkboard of the group's most common expectations, identify those that were not met/ and then discuss whether those unmet expecta- tions would make them more or less likely to want to use this method in their own future research.
2. Have students write a report to the researchers who set up the study. In that report, students should point out the strengths and weaknesses of the study and suggest improvements. This writing component could be fol- lowed by a small-group discussion in which students compare the strengths and weaknesses they noticed and try to identify the most meth- odologically sound and practical suggestions for improvement. You could also ask the students to use this small-group time to rewrite the opera- tional deffnitions that they found lacking.
3. Instructors who have their students keep journals might consider having them include an entry about this observation activity. Students could be asked to respond to the question "What do you feei you learned from this observation exercise?" If content analysis is covered in your course, you could have students use these journal responses as data and attempt to code them into categories.

            <Title>DFordney-Settlage</Title>
            <Text>## D. Fordney Settlage, MD
### Your Biography
You were born in 1940. You became an American physician and sex therapist best known for your work on sexual function and dysfunction. Your BS is from the University of Arizona (1960) and your  MD (1964) from University of California at Los Angeles.
You began your career looking at sperm motility after intercourse, but you've also been interested in the sexual experiences among teenaged girls.
You are currently working on a comprehensive overview of heterosexual dysfunction. You served as Assistant Professor, Obstetrics and Gynecology Division of Reproductive Biology at the Los Angeles County-USC Medical Center.
You were an early critic of gynecologist James C. Burt, sometimes called the 'Love Surgeon' and his involuntary surgeries on the vulvas of patients. Burt performed a number of reconstructive surgeries (perhaps hundreds) on women who had recently given birth, when they were still under the effects of episiotomy.  In his words 'Women are structurally inadequate for intercourse. This is a pathological condition amenable to surgery.'' In franker terms, he also said that his surgery would turn women into ''horny little mice'' and asserted that ''the difference between rape and rapture is salesmanship.'' (1957, quoted in a 1988 NY Times article following his censorship by the Ohio Medical Board). You, as D. Fordney-Settlage has said, "Dr. Burt is a nice person but he is a zealot and that makes him dangerous."
During your tenure at the University of Arizona Medical Center’s fertility clinic, you assisted in helping hundreds of couples with fertility issues bring babies to term. During the course of your career, a debate ensued as to whether the availability of contraceptives was promoting pre-marital sex.
You conducted a study of 500 unwed teenage girls (aged 13-17) that had sought professional help in obtaining contraceptives. Your findings provided sound grounds to conclude that not only did the availability of contraceptives fail in promoting sexual behavior, but that a lack of contraceptive availability would not deter teenage girls from participating in sexual behavior. The study demonstrated the sexual behavior in teenage girls pre-dated the use of contraceptives, and that when available, teenage girls would make use of such options in order to prevent unwanted pregnancy, impediments to future and current education, forced marriage, illegitimacy, and abortion.
### Game Objectives
You primary objective is to get on the Spitzer taskforce to advocate for psychosexual disorders in the new taxonomy. Make certain that female sexuality is not maligned as a psychological disorder in the DSM-III or the definition of 'mental health.'  Your secondary objective is to advocate for women's sexual health more broadly.  You have a long-standing friendship with both Richard Green and Harold Lief.
There is very little research on women's sexuality. Kinsey's famous study causes a good deal of consternation. Even today, the issue of homosexuality seems largely to be about male homosexuality, with lesbianism hardly mentioned as an afterthought. Work with Leona Tyler in her efforts to get a Committee on Women in Psychology, and more importantly for you, the Committee on the Psychology of Women.
The issue of female sexuality has become particularly hot recently with the popularization of oral contraceptives.  While most people favor contraceptives for women who are already sexually active, there is a great controversy over whether allowing young women access to contraceptives will make  sexually active. You are interested in settling that question.
You are neutral on the definition of mental illness, so long as it isn’t gendered in some tacit way.
#### Specific Assignments
In 1972, propose to the research committee a study on the sexual experiences of younger women who are seeking contraceptives for the first time, based on her actual 1973 paper.  
As you straddle the fence between the MD and PhDs, the Medical doctors and the Psychologists, you are in the unique position to create a compromise between Albee and _____ regarding the rights and duties of the psychologists and psychiatrists in the treatment of patients in 1972.
In 1975, give a paper critiquing the history of psychiatric and psychological theory of sexuality as overly focused on male sexuality. You should be specific here – the game book appendicies contain the small amount of work by Freud on Lesbianism, and Krafft-Ebbing's Psychopathia Sexualis contains a brief mention at the very end.  Jung's theories of female homosexuality are worth exploring as well.  Consider how 'normal' sexual maturation has been defined in male terms, and how the explanations are inequal (i.e. compare the 'Oedipal complex' to the 'Electra complex'). This will take some work. Be specific and as thorough as you can – it will be important to consider as the DSM-III is considered.

### Biography
You were born in Kentucky in 1938. You were an academically talented kid who entered Medical School at Vanderbilt at the age of 19. After completing your internship at Ohio State, you moved to Philadelphia, where you still live today.
You are often described as a “large” man, both in body and personality. While others describe you as “flamboyant” and “outspoken,” you prefer “farm boy.”  But you recognize that you can be combative and gruff in pursuit of your ideals. These attributes have not always made your life easy, especially since you are gay.  You were forced to leave the University of Pennsylvania's psychiatry residency program when your sexual orientation was discovered (recall that mentally ill people cannot practice psychiatry), but were able to complete your certification at Norristown State Hospital in Philadelphia.
You eventually were hired into the psychiatric department of the hospital of Temple University, where you remain. Talented in multiple things, you serve as the organist for St. Peter's Episcopal Church in Germantown, the neighborhood of Philadelphia where you live.
You are also a member of the secret organization of gay psychiatrists who quietly met at APA meetings, known unofficially as the “Gay-PA.”
### Game Objectives
Calling yourself 'Dr. H. Anonymous', give a talk entitled “I am a homosexual, and a psychiatrist.” during the 1971 panel discussion “Psychiatry: Friend or Foe to Homosexuals: A Dialogue” wearing a mask. The mask is really a bit of theater – everyone who matters knows who you really are. But you're making a point: that mentally ill people cannot practice psychiatry. And as homosexuality is classified as a mental illness, so technically, homosexuals should not be allowed to practice psychiatry. But they do – many homosexuals are very good psychiatrists, including yourself. It follows, therefore, that the classification is not only unhelpful to homosexuals themselves, it is actually harming the discipline of psychiatry.
The text of Dr. H. Anonymous' speech was widely available on the internet, but as of Feb, 2011, it appears to have been removed. I'll included it below, but it is important that your speech models the original, not replicates it. You need to write this in your own words, but making arguments that are along the same lines as the original.
Work with your fellow Gay-PA members to remove 'homosexuality' from the DSM and opposing any attempt to reintroduce any substitute classification.
In 1974, propose that the deem ban the use of aversion therapy in the treatment of homosexuality immoral.  You should research some of the first-hand stories available on http://www.treatmentshomosexuality.org.uk/ to make your case.\
You are neutral on the definition of mental illness. 
### Must Read
Dr. H. Anonymous speech:
"Thank you, Dr. Robinson. I am a homosexual. I am a psychiatrist. I, like most of you in this room, am a member of the APA and am proud to be a member. However, tonight I am, insofar as in it is possible, a ‘we.’ I attempt tonight to speak for many of my fellow gay members of the APA as well as for myself. When we gather at these conventions, we have a group, which we have glibly come to call the Gay-PA. And several of us feel that it is time that real flesh and blood stand up before you and ask to be listened to and understood insofar as that is possible. I am disguised tonight in order that I might speak freely without conjuring up too much regard on your part about the particular WHO I happen to be. I do that mostly for your protection. I can assure you that I could be any one of more than a hundred psychiatrists registered at this convention. And the curious among you should cease attempting to figure out who I am and listen to what I say.
"We homosexual psychiatrists must persistently deal with a variety of what we shall call ‘Nigger Syndromes.’ We shall describe some of them and how they make us feel.
"As psychiatrists who are homosexual, we must know our place and what we must do to be successful. If our goal is academic appointment, a level of earning capacity equal to our fellows, or admission to a psychoanalytic institute, we must make certain that no one in a position of power is aware of our sexual orientation or gender identity. Much like the black man with the light skin who chooses to live as a white man, we cannot be seen with our real friends - our real homosexual family - lest our secret be known and our dooms sealed. There are practicing psychoanalysts among us who have completed their training analysis without mentioning their homosexuality to their analysts. Those who are willing to speak up openly will do so only if they have nothing to lose, then they won’t be listened to.
"As psychiatrists who are homosexuals, we must look carefully at the power which lies in our hands to define the health of others around us. In particular, we should have clearly in our minds, our own particular understanding of what it is to be a healthy homosexual in a world, which sees that appellation as an impossible oxymoron. One cannot be healthy and be homosexual, they say. One result of being psychiatrists who are homosexual is that we are required to be more healthy than our heterosexual counterparts. We have to make some sort of attempt through therapy or analysis to work problems out. Many of us who make that effort are still left with a sense of failure and of persistence of "the problem." Just as the black man must be a super person, so must we, in order to face those among our colleagues who know we are gay. We could continue to cite examples of this sort of situation for the remainder of the night. It would be useful, however, if we could now look at the reverse.
"What is it like to be a homosexual who is also a psychiatrist? Most of us Gay-PA members do not wear our badges into the Bayou Landing [a gay bar in Dallas] or the local Canal Baths. If we did, we could risk the derision of all the non-psychiatrist homosexuals. There is much negative feeling in the homosexual community towards psychiatrists. And those of us who are visible are the easiest targets from which the angry can vent their wrath. Beyond that, in our own hometowns, the chances are that in any gathering of homosexuals, there is likely to be any number of patients or paraprofessional employees who might try to hurt us professionally in a larger community if those communities enable them to hurt us that way.
"Finally, as homosexual psychiatrists, we seem to present a unique ability to marry ourselves to institutions rather than wives or lovers. Many of us work 20 hours daily to protect institutions that would literally chew us up and spit us out if they knew the truth. These are our feelings, and like any set of feelings, they have value insofar as they move us toward concrete action.
"Here, I will speak primarily to the other members of the Gay-PA who are present, not in costume tonight. Perhaps you can help your fellow psychiatrist friends understand what I am saying. When you are with professionals, fellow professionals, fellow psychiatrists who are denigrating the "faggots" and the "queers," don’t just stand back, but don’t give up your careers, either. Show a little creative ingenuity; make sure you let your associates know that they have a few issues that they have to think through again. When fellow homosexuals come to you for treatment, don’t let your own problems get in your way, but develop creative ways to let the patient know that they’re all right. And teach them everything they need to know. Refer them to other sources of information with basic differences from your own so that the homosexual will be freely able to make his own choices.
"Finally, pull up your courage by your bootstraps, and discover ways in which you and homosexual psychiatrists can be closely involved in movements which attempt to change the attitudes of heterosexuals - and homosexuals - toward homosexuality. For all of us have something to lose. We may not be considered for that professorship. The analyst down the street may stop referring us his overflow. Our supervisor may ask us to take a leave of absence. We are taking an even bigger risk, however, not accepting fully our own humanity, with all of the lessons it has to teach all the other humans around us and ourselves. This is the greatest loss: our honest humanity. And that loss leads all those others around us to lose that little bit of their humanity as well. For, if they were truly comfortable with their own homosexuality, then they could be comfortable with ours. We must use our skills and wisdom to help them - and us - grow to be comfortable with that little piece of humanity called homosexuality."

            <Text>Game Play

Each week, or two sessions, of game play reenacts ones on conference of the APA in the 1970s.   The annual meeting of the APA is a huge event. There are presentations on current research, panel discussions of issues facing the discipline, administrative meetings for various committees, and publishers promoting their products.

The first session of each conference opens with a presidential address. Presidents are elected based on their reputation as researchers, but they also must have keen leadership skills and knowledge of policies and procedures of the organization's committee structure. Since these two areas of expertise do not always appear in the same person, the president is not elected directly by the membership. The membership holds an annual election for the vice-president, who is then promoted to president after a year of sitting on the executive committee and observing the inner workings of the political system.
 
The executive committee is composed of the APA President, the Vice president, and three members elected at large each serving three year terms, one expiring each year. The executive secretary, who serves without vote, is responsible for maintaining the minutes of the executive committee and taking whatever actions the committee approves during its meetings.

Events that happen at year's conference:
(1)	Executive committee meet in open session.
1.	All committees and task forces report
(2)	Executive committee meet in closed session, if necessary.
(3)	Open sessions for presenting current research.
(4)	Panel discussions on topics proposed by membership.
(5)	Election for vice president, who assumes that position at the close of that conference.
(6)	Election for member-at-large on the executive committee.
(7)	Closing remarks by current vice president, who assumes the role of president at the end of the conference.
Committee structure
The APA is overseen by an executive committee, which is responsible for maintaining the organization, and approving all official publications of the organization.  The president, who opens the conference with his or her presidential address, also serves as chair of the executive committee during that conference. The secretary of the executive committee is responsible for maintaing the minutes for that meeting and taking whatever actions are required. The membership of the executive committee is:

President
Chair of the executive committee, serving a 1-year term
Vice President – elected annually
Serves a 1-year term as Vice President, automatically promoted to President for the next year at the close of that year's annual conference
Executive secretary (preceptor), without vote

Committee member elected at large
Serving 3-year term.
Committee member elected at large
Serving 3-year term.

Table 2: Terms for executive committee members
The executive committee is one of a handful of standing committees of the APA. Standing committees are permanent institutions, whose membership is elected by the membership at large. Ad Hoc (literally 'after the fact') committees are created by simple majority vote of the executive committee to generate a report on a specific problem or area of research. Usually, these are formed when the executive committee believes it has inadequate information on a specific subject. For the purposes of this game, ad hoc committees will conduct literature reviews on behalf of the executive committee. Ad hoc committees dissolve after the report is accepted by the executive committee.  

Task forces are created by the executive committee to complete a specific  task. When the executive committee creates a new task force, it gives that force a 'charge', which specifies and limits its responsibilities and powers. Like ad hoc committees, task forces disappear at the completion of their task – but unlike ad hoc committees, that task need not be the creation of a report.

The executive committee has the power to create ad hoc committees and task forces as it sees fit. The membership of those committees may be specified directly by the executive committee at the time of creation, left to the chair of the committee to decide, or even determined by popular vote of the membership.

The creation of new standing committees require a majority vote of the APA membership.

	Reputation

	The Responsibilities of the President
Special Rules
	Reading aloud

Presentations at academic conferences are evaluated by peers primarily on the basis of the content presented, not the style of presentation. While it is important to practice good public speaking skills-making eye contact with the audience, modulating one's voice, etc—getting the data right is more important than being entertaining. For that reason, this game will allow 'reading' of some presentations.   Presidential addresses should be carefully crafted general lectures. Experimental reports should highlight the data presented, and carefully articulate the structure of the experiment performed. It is also advisable to bring handouts for the membership when presenting data.
Panel discussions and presentations to the committees, however, should be delivered without a transcript. Cue cards or notes are allowed, but in these cases, the speaker must strive to make a personal connection with the audience, and hence, must not simply read a prepared speech.
	Role of the gamemaster


Ethics committee – (add Zimbardo as a character. IF proposal is OK'd, the gamemaster can use his or her discression to allow either the student to report, or to show 'Quiet Rage'. After that, the ethics committee shall be charged with creating a new ethical standard that would rule out such experiments).

            <Title>Calls for Papers and Symposia</Title>
            <Text>
#### Call for Papers and Symposia
##### Introduction
 I.	The Program committee herein announces a Call of Papers and Symposia for the annual convention of the APA. Please read the relevant rules carefully if you plan to take part in the program. Note especially the deadlines, the form for abstracts of contributed papers, the forms for symposium proposals, and the proper persons to receive your correspondence. The pertinent references have been collected into the box on this page for your convenience.

This year will begin with a plenary address by the President. Current plans allow for 2 individual reports and 1 symposium.  The Board of Directors will meet in open session to hear proposals from the membership.
 #####Kinds of Programs and Sessions
The meetings regularly contain many kinds of programs and sessions, including research papers, symposia, group discussions, addresses, business meetings, and film sessions, as well as other events, such as reunions, dinners, social hours and the like. In general, requests for information should be submitted to the Program Committee.

The APA Program Committee has full responsibility for the conference program. Persons planning to submit proposals that fall outside the lines outlined herein should consult with the chairman of the APA Program Committee for special instructions.

The chairman of the APA Program Committee should also receive all requests for scheduling of nonsubstantive program activities such as reunions, dinners, social hours, headquarters space, luncheons, and the like. To insure publication in the program all requests must be received by the close of business on the Friday before a conference.
 ##### Who may participate
 ###### Volunteered Papers
 Any member of the APA may read a paper, provided that it has been accepted by the program committee.

 ###### A nonmember of the APA
may read a paper provided that he is sponsored by a member of the  APA and provided that his qualifications and the quality of his paper are acceptable to the program committee. The APA member who agrees to sponsor a nonmember must submit the abstract of the nonmember's paper to the chairman of the program committee with an accompanying description of the nonmember's scientific qualifications plus the names of recognized scientific societies in which the nonmember holds membership.

 ###### Symposia and invited addresses
The program committee may invite distinguished nonmembers to contribute to the program as special speakers or as participants in symposia. Because symposia often involve topics extending beyond the competence of APA members, it is frequently desirable to include nonmembers as participants.  Acceptance of a distinguished speaker or of a symposium proposal by the Program Committee constitutes the require sponsorship of nonmember participants.
 #####Limits of Individual Participation
Over the past several years the APA's Board of Directors working with the program committee has developed several ground rules for the limits of individual participation in the annual convention program. These rules were designed to ensure the widest possible participation by APA members and also to prevent troublesome conflicts in the time schedule. Briefly, the rules have been that each member may present no more than one volunteered paper and that each member may, in addition, participate in no more than one additional session such as a symposium, discussion group, and the like. It is still strongly recommended that maximum participation be limited to one symposium or discussion group plus one paper.

 #####Individual Reports
Unless otherwise indicated, four ten-minute papers will be scheduled for each 50-minute session. In instances of multiple authorship the person whose name is listed first will be expected to present the paper.

A paper previously read at the Annual APA Convention may not be read again, unless it is a substantial elaboration (additional findings, etc.). Two papers which report highly similar findings from a cooperative project may not be read at the convention.

The APA Board of Directors have voted that, for reasons of economy, this rule should be followed: Abstracts printed in the American Psychologist are limited to 100 words. However, it is recognized that more detailed information will be needed by the Program Committee for use in the selection of papers.  The procedures for research reports and other individual reports are described below.

 ######Research Reports
*Each author of a research report must submit a 100-word abstract (1 copy) for publication if the paper is accepted, and also a 300-word summary (4 copies) for committee publication.*  If the author desires, tables presenting results may be submitted with the 300-word summary. Not more than one page of tables should be submitted. This means that all the data should have been obtained and the analysis completed at the time the abstract and summary are submitted to the Program Committee.

 ######Other individual reports
Theoretical papers, case studies, and the like are perfectly acceptable for the program.  *The 100-word abstract of a non-experimental paper must, however, be accompanied by a manuscript of the complete paper in draft form.* The complete manuscript is required in order that the Program Committee may be in a better position to judge the contribution to the program.

 ######Form of abstracts and summaries
All abstracts and summaries must be typed on one side of the paper only, double-spaced throughout and on 8 1/2” X 11” paper.

####### The 100-word abstract
The purpose of the published abstract is to provide information concerning the psychological relevance of the paper. .. primarily to justify its scientific validity. Hence abstracts should be concerned with content … rather than with method and technique unless the purpose of the paper is essentially methodological). Examples of good short abstracts from many different fields may be found in *Psychological Abstracts*.

Abstracts must be limited in length to 100 words (not counting title, author and institution). Longer abstracts will not be printed but will be listed by title only. Abstracts should not contain tables, drawings, footnotes, or bibliographic entries, as such material will not be printed.

The following outline should be followed in preparing the abstract:

Title of Paper:
Author(s):				Sponsor (if any):
Institution(s):
     *Text of abstract* (not to exceed 100 words)

Because the 100-word abstract will be sent to the printer, do not underline or type anything with all capital letters. The type written abstract should be checked and proofread carefully, since it will be printed in the form in which it is submitted.  Authors are urged to give careful thought to the visual aides that will best facilitate presentations of their data.  If slides are used, members are urged to consider presenting graphic and tabular material on paper.  As a new procedure, authors of accepted papers will be asked to indicate their preference for audio-visual support.
####### The 300-word summary

The text of the summary will normally include a statement of the problem, subjects used, procedure, results and conclusions.

Summaries must be limited in length to 300 words (not counting title, author, and institution). The 300-word summary may be accompanied by not more than one page of supplementary tables, drawings, footnotes, etc.

The form for submitting the 300-word summary should be exactly the same as for the 100-word abstract except, of course, for the longer text.

Four copies of the 300-word summary and the supplementary tables, etc. are required. *Author, sponsor, and institution should appear on the first copy only.* The first copy is the one that will be used by the Program Committee Chair in the creation of the Conference Proceedings. The other three copies without identifying data will be used by the Program Committee for judging the acceptability of the paper.

###### Where to send abstracts and summaries

Copies of the abstract and summary of a volunteered paper should be sent to the chair of the Program Committee.
##### Symposia
A symposium provides for several prepared papers on a single theme or problem. It is an excellent form of meeting if the aim is to bring to an audience several diverse or even contradictory views, presented by a number of “experts.” The expectation would be that all papers would first be read; then there would be a substantial period for interchanging of views among the speakers (and invited discussants, if desired); finally, a brief period for questions or points raised from the floor. It is important to plan the time so that there is real interaction among participants after the papers. In order to realize the unique value of the symposium the chairman should select speakers at an early date, arrange for the participants to exchange papers ell in advance of the session, and ensure that ample time is allotted for discussion among the participants and contributors from the audience

###### Initiation of symposia
Any member of the APA may suggest a symposium topic to the chairman of the Program Committee. Such proposals must be made at an early date as a successful symposium requires much planning and correspondence. A member may also submit a fully organized symposium for the Program Committee's consideration.

 ###### Form of symposium proposals
####### Suggestions to the Program Committee
When a member only suggests but does not organize a symposium, he should indicate the title of the topic for discussion, comment on the significance of the topic, and list the names and addresses of the proposed chairman and other participants. Such suggestions should be sent to the appropriate divisional program chairman well in advance of the deadline to allow for ample time for planning.

####### Member-Organized symposia
A member may organize a proposed symposium in complete detail and present it for approval to the Program Committee. Each such proposal should indicate the title of the symposium and list the names of the chairman and participants, together with the titles of participants' contributions, if these titles are to be published. *Five copies of the completed symposium plans must be submitted to the Program Committee by the deadline.*

####### Symposia organized by the Program Committee

Symposia may be organized independently by the Program Committee or in response to the requests of members.
##### Special Programs
The Program Committee should feel free to try new kinds of programs.  Forums, discussion groups, panels, round tables, conferences, and workshops are often valuable alternatives to papers and symposia. Members are invited to send suggestions for new types of programs to the Program Committee. Special sessions should be suggested well in advance of the deadline to allow for ample time for planning. Procedures for initiating special programs should follow in general the procedures for initiating symposia.

##### Miscellaneous Meetings and Special Sessions
APA boards, committees, etc. desiring business meetings must send to the Chairman of the APA Program Committee by the deadline a statement of estimated attendance, time required, time and day preferred and whether arrangements for luncheon and dinner are desired.

Luncheons, dinners and social hours may be scheduled for non-APA organizations if they send their request to the chairman of the APA Program Committee by the deadline.  Such scheduled events will be listed in the condensed program.

##### Audio-Visual Presentations
APA members, commercial film producers or distributors who wish to present new films, film strips, or other audio-visual aids (including sound recordings) should make the Program Committee aware of this fact at the deadline.  The committee will review and select the audio-visual materials which are to be presented as part of the APA program.

##### Exhibits
APA members are encouraged to exhibit apparatus, teaching aids, and other materials of scientific and applied interest. Commercial agencies are invited to request arrangements for exhibits. All commercial exhibitors will be charged for space. Those wishing to arrange for exhibits must write to the chairman of the Program Committee.


#### Call for Research Grants
##### Introduction
The Research Committee of the APA herein solicits proposals for research that will forward the disciplines of psychology and psychiatry. Note especially the deadlines, the form for abstracts of contributed papers, the forms for symposium proposals, and the proper persons to receive your correspondence. The pertinent references have been collected into the box on this page for your convenience.

Winners will be granted the support of the other members of the class for a period of one class session. The primary investigator must specify in the research proposal how the other students will participate: as subjects, participants, observers or confederates.

Winning grants will be determined by the Research Committee, in accordance with the criteria specified herein.  All proposals must be in line with the APA's ethical guidelines which are in force at the time of submission.

##### Research Supported
The APA seeks to advance the creation, communication and application of knowledge of the mind and behavior to benefit society and improve people's lives. The APA embraces scientific inquiry into all aspects of the human experience — from the functions of the brain to the actions of nations, from child development to care for the aged. And in every conceivable setting from scientific research centers to mental health care services, "the understanding of behavior" is the enterprise of psychologists.

Additionally, the APA aspires to advance the understanding of psychology and psychiatry as scientific disciplines. To that end, it will support any research that follows the standards of scientific inquiry and contributes to the central goals of the association.

It is imperative that all research supported by the APA must be accordance with the ethical guidelines published by the APA.  

##### Who May Submit Proposals
###### Members of the APA
Any member of the APA may submit a proposal for a research grant.  APA membership is limited to those meeting the definition of 'Psychologist' or 'Psychiatrist' used by the APA (see p. 10 of the gamebook).

###### Nonmembers of the APA
As the APA Research committee seeks to further the disciplines of Psychology and Psychiatry wherever they are practiced, the primary investigator of a grant need ot be a member of the APA. The primary investigator, however, must be a Psychologist or Psychiatrist as defined by the APA (see p. 10 of the gamebook).

###### Confederates, Observers and Assistants
Individuals working in psychological research should be engaged in some significant way with the academic pursuit of knowledge. Confederates, observers and assistants in research must therefore be students of psychology or psychiatry, if not psychologists or psychiatrists in their own right.

##### Limitations of Participation
A primary investigator may submit one (1) proposal annually. An individual may serve as a consultant, confederate, observer or assistant on any number of grant proposals in addition to proposing himself as a primary investigator.   

##### Form of the Proposal

            <Title>Main Factions</Title>
            <Text>### Main Factions

Players represent three factions with different perspectives on not only the nature of scientific inquiry into the human mind, but the object of those studies themselves.  A number of independents, representing a variety of academic disciplines, complement these three factions.

It should be noted that unlike some other reacting games, individuals in these factions are not bound to think or vote the same way on the central issues in the game. The factions represent high-level agreement on the nature of the science of the mind, there is almost complete disagreement on all other issues. In fact, when it comes to actual game play, you might find that your votes are more aligned with members of other factions than your own.

#### Psychoanalysts

Psychoanalysts are split in the classical (Freudian), Jungian and unspecified.  The game contains a number of independent psychiatrists who, while they are familiar with psychoanalysis, are not professed members of the faction.

##### Classical

Classical psychoanalysis can be summarized by five basic hypotheses:

1.	First, psychoanalysts hold that the mind is composed of entities in conflict, also known as the hypothesis of intrapsychic conflict or dynamic hypothesis. In classic Freudianism, the hypothesis followed “the discovery of the unconscious” by Breuer and Freud in 1895 (see Error! Reference source not found. on page Error! Bookmark not defined.). Traumatic event or fantasies can leave a subject with memories that are unacceptable to the conscious awareness. The conscious awareness defends itself by suppressing the traumatic event in the unconscious by means of repression (see, e.g. Introductory Lectures on Psychoanalysis, p. 82, 94 also p. 438). This hypothesis is sometimes called the psychodynamic hypothesis.

2.	Second, psychoanalysis posits that there is a finite amount of psychic energy available to any given individual. This forms the Economic hypothesis of classical psychoanalysis (See Freud, Introductory Lectures, p. 26 and 436-7 for the thesis that psychic energy is sexual; p. 340, 442-3 and 466for an explicit statement. It also appears in On the Interpretation Dreams, Ch7). The activities of the mind are “costly,” and hence the mind will optimize its function for the most efficient option.

3.	The topographical hypothesis is Freud's most well known:  the mind composed of three basic kinds of thoughts: conscious thoughts, pre-conscious thoughts and unconscious thoughts. The term 'thoughts' here is used broadly, to include wishes, desires, fears, emotions, etc. Conscious thoughts are those of which we are aware. Pre-conscious thoughts, are not currently conscious, but are readily available to consciousness. The memory of your last birthday, for example, is probably pre-conscious, not unconscious. Unconscious thoughts, which far outnumber the other two categories, are unavailable to consciousness. All these thoughts, however, originate in experience: there is nothing in the unconscious store that is not linked in some way to that individual's past experiences. (see, e.g. Introductory lectures, p. 25)

4.	Fourth, the genetic hypothesis claims that human behavior is best explained in terms of the original conditions that cause it. In Freud's theory, the genetic hypothesis takes the form of his theory of infantile sexuality.

For Freud, all behavior ultimately originates in sexual desire. To summarize briefly: Freud hypothesized that sexual drive, the main source of psychic energy, is present from birth. He is explicit in using the term 'sexual' here, but it is sometimes easier to understand if we use a softer term like 'using one's body for pleasure.' Freud repeated argues for infantile sexuality by pointing out the noncontroversial pleasure children take in tickling or cuddling, but we wouldn't necessarily call these 'sexual' today. Freud, somewhat to his determinate, insisted on the term 'sexual' even despite these kind of objections.

This drive towards physical gratification takes various forms throughout our lives, moving through the oral phase to the anal phase to the phallic stage. If the internal drives are left unfulfilled, or the internal conflicts unresolved (which is really two ways of saying the same thing), neurotic behavior results.

5.	Psychoanalysts differ with respect to the entities that comprise the mind, but most recognize Freud's basic structural hypothesis: the mind is functionally divided between the id, the ego and the superego (see Introductory Lectures, p. 365). The id, which is totally unconscious, contains the representations of sexual and aggressive instinctual drives. The ego regulates and controls the desires of the id in relation to the demands of the external world, which are internalized as the superego. The ego follows the economic hypothesis, in seeking to maximize gratification of the instinctual desires while minimizing the amount of psychic energy spent in that process. It achieves this end through the use of various mechanisms of representation and repression (sometimes called 'defense mechanisms'):

* Repression: The first mechanism proposed by Freud (Breuer and Freud), the ego banishes or precludes an idea or feeling from conscious awareness.
* Isolation: Ideas are split off from their associated feelings (affect) and presented as alien or foreign in origin.
* Reaction formation: replacing the unacceptable desire with its symbolic opposite.
* Displacement: unacceptable wishes are removed from their original objects and moved to an acceptable, or at least not-unacceptable one.
* Projection: an unacceptable idea or desire is attributed to someone else.
* Undoing: painful or unacceptable ideas are minimized by overdoing some opposite action in some opposite arena.
* Turning against the self:  the original object of an unpleasant desire (usually hate) is replaced with the self.
* Denial: the individual remains unaware of certain aspects of reality that would be painful to recognize.
* Rationalization: the individual convinces himself or herself that their behavior has a logical, reasonable, or at least neutral, explanation in order to avoid the unacceptable cause.
* Identification: usually found during development, a child becomes like another person (usually a parent) in order to deal with separation or loss of a love-object.

These conflicts can be discovered by studying the mechanisms of representation that are used to obfuscate and repress traumatic experiences and latent desires.  The mechanisms of representation take the object represented (the 'latent content') and replace it with a representation (the 'manifest content'). The relationship between these two can be one of:

* part to whole: the latent content is fragmented and represented in isolation. (Introductory Lectures, p. 147)
* allusion: the latent content is represented by, in Freud's words “a caption, as it were, or an abbreviation in telegraphic style.” (Introductory Lectures, p. 148)
* plastic portrayal: the latent content is replaced with a plastic, concrete portrayal of it, taking its cue from the superficial aspects of the latent content. For example, the editor of a 'Survey' may be represented in a dream as a 'surveyor'. (Introductory Lectures, p.149)
* symbolism: symbols are stable translations of one object into another. The relation between the object symbolized (the latent content) and the object that does the symbolization (the manifest content) is stable in an individual, but may not be stable between individuals. But it is always true that the latent content and manifest content share something in common. It is the task of the psychoanalysts, through the techniques of free association and manipulating transference reactions, to discover the common factors between the latent and manifest content, and hence reveal the symbolic relationships. (Introductory Lectures, p. 185)
	(see Introductory lectures on psychoanalysis,  Lecture VII-X)

By revealing these relationships to the subject of psychoanalysis, the ego becomes aware of latent trauma and hence can deal with it in healthy ways, removing the conflict and obviating the neurosis.

Interpsychic conflict is a part of the normal maturation of a healthy adult mind. Neurosis and Psychosis occur, therefore, when this development goes wrong in some important way. Development can go awry through inhibition or regression (see Introductory Lectures, Ch 22-23).  In 'inhibition', portions of function of the ego are held back from development, often because it becomes fixated on a particular libidnal instinct.  In 'regression' an ego that has progressed further than a given developmental stage returns to that stage was a kind of defense mechanism.

The terms 'neurosis' and 'psychoneurosis':

&gt; “refer to a class of psychiatric illnesses characterized by prominent symptoms that have no significant somatic origin. The symptoms include disturbances of feelings (anxiety, depression, guilt), disturbances of thought (obsessions), and disturbances of behavior (compulsions and phobic inhibitions), all of which are experienced as alien to the comfort and well-being of the individual” (American Handbook of Psychiatry, p. 737-738)

Neurosis, then, is explained when the conflict between the desires of the id and the defense mechanisms of the ego go awry: (1) the ego's defense mechanism leaves the drive unfulfilled, (2) the defense mechanism imposes a disguised or symbolic form onto the original drive in order to hide it from the consciousness, and (3) the superego imposes some suffering as punishment for the self-denial, such a guilt.

Psychosis occurs when the id constructs its own reality and imposes it on the ego. The subject can no longer function in normal life—he or she may be beset by hallucinations, persistent delusions, wild mood swings, visual and auditory agnosia, amnesia, etc. It is worth noting that unlike neuroses, psychoses may be the result of organic brain syndromes or other physical conditions. Psychoses not associated with physical conditions include schizophrenia, affective disorders and other reactions.

As the id is the source of psychic energy, unacceptable drives using one of the mechanisms above will not remain repressed forever. As unacceptable drives gain in strength and threaten to reveal themselves, a number of reactions are possible (see Introductory Lectures, Ch. 19):

* Anxiety reaction: a chronic, free-floating anxiety which may have periods of acute anxiety. Typified by feelings of helplessness; although symptoms include phobias, obsessions, compulsions and depression. It is caused by the failure of all the defenses to keep the unacceptable instinctual drives in stable control. (Introductory Lectures, Ch. 25, p. 452)
* phobic reaction: typified by one or more prominent phobias: and extreme anxiety focused on an ordinary place, object or situation.  The mechanism of displacement moves the anxiety associated with the unacceptable drive to a neutral place, object or situation, which then is allowed to flourish unchecked by the defense mechanisms of the ego. (Introductory Lectures, p. 495-498)
* conversion reaction: what used to be called 'hysteria', it can manifest itself in many symptoms, including spasms, temporary paralysis, visual or auditory agnosia, weakness, shortness of breath, pains, etc. It results when the unacceptable instinctual drive is 'converted' into apparently physical symptoms. (Introductory Lectures, p. 485, 497-8)
* obsessive-compulsive reaction: the patient is troubled by persistent thoughts that are usually painful in nature. These obsessional thoughts interfere in some important way with the patient's ability to engage in a meaningful adult life: i.e. intellectually, sexually, socially or professionally. Anxiety at not following through on an obsessional thought, which often manifests as repeated actions regarding some mundane object, can be severe and often is only revealed by completion of the mundane task in question. (Introductory Lectures, Ch. 17)

As an example, classical psychoanalysis holds that obsessive-compulsive reaction can be traced to unresolved conflicts in the anal stage of development, where frustration at potty-training is turned into rage towards one's mother. That rage, in turn, is found to be unacceptable by the ego and repressed through one of the standard mechanisms creating obsessions with objects or scenarios that are symbolically linked to the original frustration. The particular object of obsession is essentially random, as the subject latches onto some mundane object present at the time of the frustration. The choice of obsessional object, however, can provide clues as to the true cause of the frustration, as it is invariably linked, through one of the mechanisms of representation, to the true object. The compulsive aspect of this conditions is an 'acceptable' outlet for the unacceptable rage towards one's mother.  Psychoanalysts go on to hold that obsessive-compulsive is often unconsciously aware of his or her rage and may take extreme steps to avoid losing control when provoked.  
####### Psychoanalytic Treatment.
Psychoanalysis—the process of psychoanalytic treatment—aims at resolving unresolved conflicts that cause neurosis. The psychoanalyst seeks to align the psychic forces within the individual so that they are no longer in conflict. A psychoanalyst must keep all five psychoanalytic hypotheses—the topographical, dynamic, economy, genetic and structural—in mind during treatment, but in practice, tends to focus on one or two at a time.  

Classical psychoanalysis makes use of two basic techniques: free association and manipulating transference reactions. In free association, the psychoanalyst removes himself or herself from the patients line of sight (hence the standard couch with the psychoanalyst seated behind the patients' head), and asks the patient to say whatever comes to mind when prompted regardless of logic, order or social constraint. In a relaxed state, it is theorized, these free-associations will reveal the connections between ideas that, when analyzed, explain the relationships this particular patient uses to represent latent content with manifest content.

Freud is often naively criticized for insisting on universal symbolic relationships: cigars always represent penises, for example. But this simply isn't true: classical psychoanalysis is 'empirical' in the sense that there is nothing in the mind that was not put there from experience.  The symbolic relationships found in a patient have built up by that patient, based on his or her unique experiences. Where commonalities occur between patients, they are at the level of the language (i.e. symbolic relationships that originate from homophones in German would not be found in an English-speaking patient) or culture (i.e. shared mythology). So while a cigar may represent a penis because of its shape to some, it may represent excrement because of its color to others.

Transference reactions are inappropriate reactions in which the patient reacts to a person or object in the present as if it were a person or object from the past (see Introductory Lectures, Ch. 27). Transference is, in Freud's terms, a 'repetition,' a reliving of an event, relationship, emotion, attitude, etc. with a substitute person or object. Transference can be a very powerful tool for the psychoanalyst, especially when the object that is the source of the unresolved conflict can be projected onto a substitute, and the patient allowed to address the object directly. If a patient's neurosis originates in unresolved anger towards his dead father, substituting a inanimate object for that father can allow the patient to exorcise the anger and hence dissolve the neurosis. Since Freud's masterwork Dora, many psychoanalysts have held transference to be the primary tool of psychoanalysis.

In order for transference to work, however, the patient must be willing and capable of suspending his or her 'ego' and regressing to the state where he or she really believes that the substitute is the original source of the conflict. As psychotics live in a state where experienced reality is formed by the psychic desire not reality itself; psychotics are not suitable candidates for treatment via transference.

Throughout treatment, the psychoanalysts must be aware of resistance.  Resistance is the patient's opposition to treatment. It defends the status quo by maintaining the neurosis or psychosis. Resistance may be conscious, subconscious or pre-conscious. It may hinder or misdirect free association. It may distract via inappropriate and unhelpful transference reactions. It may adapt to novel situations and invent new strategies. As Freud himself said “The resistance accompanies the treatment step by step. Every single association, every act of the person under treatment must reckon with the resistance and represents a compromise between the forces that are striving towards recovery and the opposing ones.” (1912, p. 11).

The psychoanalytic treatment can then be broken down into four basic steps:

	Confrontation. The first step in psychoanalysis: the patient's conscious ego must be made aware that there is a problem.  
	Clarification: The problem is put into sharp focus. Often, this process works with the previous, as minor conflicts give way to greater conflicts.
	Interpretation: The process of bringing the unconscious conflict into consciousness.
	Working through: the progressive elaboration of resistance mechanisms as they manifest.
There are, of course, many more complications that occur in any single patient's psychoanalytic treatment, but these four basic steps are almost universally recognized.

When embarking on a new treatment, then, the psychoanalyst has three basic aims:

	To translate the productions of the patient into their unconscious antecedents. The patient's thoughts, fantasies, feelings, behavior, and impulses have to be traced to their unconscious predecessors.
	The unconscious elements must be synthesized into meaningful insights. Fragments of past and present history, conscious and unconscious, must be connected so as to give a sense of continuity and coherence in terms of the patient's life.
	The insight so obtained must be communicable to the patient. As one listens one must ascertain what uncovered material will be constructively utilizable by the patient. (quoting from the American Handbook of Psychiatry , p. 779)

####### Adler

INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK FOR THE TIME BEING

####### Jung

Jungian psychoanalysis is distinguished from classical psychoanalysis by two major shifts in the basic theory.

	Jungian psychoanalysis holds that the subconscious contains psychical elements that do not originate in the experiences of the individual being psychoanalyzed.  As mentioned previously, classical psychoanalysis is empirical about the mind (for an explanation of that tradition, see Error! Reference source not found. p. Error! Bookmark not defined.), holding that the mind comes into the world as a blank slate (tabla rasa), and is progressively filled by experiences. The contents of the unconscious must therefore be traceable to discrete experiences in the individual's life. And it is the task of psychoanalysis to discover those experiences.  

Jungian psychoanalysts believe they have evidence of unconscious contents that are not explainable by the experiences of the individual. Thus, they hypothesize the existence of a deeper 'collective unconscious' that is composed of 'archetypes' that inform and structure the content of both the unconscious as well as our conscious lives.

	Second, on a related note, Jungian psychoanalysis extends the genetic hypothesis from Freud's insistence that all psychic energy was sexual energy to include sexual energy as just one of many sources of psychic energy.

For example, Freud originally posited that neurosis originated in traumatic experience in childhood on the basis of self-reports of his case-study patients. He ultimately came to realize, however, that these self-reports were fictionalizations, theorizing that the  true cause of his patient's neurosis lay in their infantile fixations. Once again, Jung extends Freud's insight to allow for fixations throughout life. He argues that:

&gt;	..the moment of the outbreak of neurosis is not just a matter of chance; as a rule it is most critical. It is usually the moment when a new psychological adjustment, that is, a new adaptation, is demanded. Such moments facilitate the outbreak of a neurosis, as every experienced neurologist knows.

 &gt; This fact seems to me extremely significant. If the fixation were indeed real we should expect to find its influence constant: in other words, a neurosis lasting throughout life. This is obviously not the case. The psychological determination of a neurosis is only partly due to an early infantile predisposition; it must be due to some cause in the present as well. (The Essential Jung, 49 “Psychoanalysis and Neurosis”)

That leads to the general proposition that Freud's identification of sexual desire as the origin of neurosis was far too narrow. Sexual desire is one of the pleasurable instincts that shape our psychology, but for Jung, “psychoanalytic theory should be freed from the purely sexual standpoint. In place of it I should like to introduce an energetic viewpoint into the psychology of neurosis” (ibid, p. 50).

Jung hypothesizes that the libidinal energies naturally increased when faced with an obstacle, in order to overcome it through adaptation. When that obstacle is too great, the libido retreats and regresses, and the patient reverts to a more primitive “mode of adaptation.” The practice of psychoanalysis is the same, however, as Jung theorizes that the energy that the patient needs to overcome the present obstacle and become healthy is attached to these sexual fixations. By bringing past frustrations and maladaptations to light through psychoanalysis, the libidinal energy is free to return to the present-day task: adaptation to overcome the current obstacle.

The task of a psychoanalyst, then, is not only to discover the original traumatic cause of a neurosis, probably buried deep in childhood, but to discover the current obstacle that is perceived as being insurmountable. Jung agrees with Freud that the childhood fixations determine the form of neurosis, but unlike Freud holds that they cannot be considered the immediate cause of neurosis.

The difference between practice among the psychoanalytic approaches is emphasis, not technique. As J.B. Wheelwright noted in 1963, “Freud focused on sexuality, Adler focused on power, and Jung focused on growth, which he called individuation.” (quoted in American Handbook of Psychiatry, p. 817)

#### Behaviorists

Behaviorism holds that psychology is properly limited to the observation, prediction and control of behavior. It  typified by four hypotheses:

	Internal entities are neither the object of scientific study nor explanatorily relevant to psychology. Behaviorism begins with the deceptively simply insight that while psychoanalytic explanations are framed in terms of psychic entities (ego, id, etc.), quantities (psychic energy) and interactions (the mechanisms of repression), what all psychological theories seek to explain is behavior. These psychic entities, and the massive vocabulary that is required to discuss them, are all hypothetical, posited for the sake of explaining why people behave the way they do. Moreover, psychoanalytic hypotheses require a sharp dividing line between human behavior and animal behavior, which is not born out by empirical observation.

To be scientific, then, psychology must limit itself to observable behavior. The discourse of psychology as a scientific discipline is restricted to those terms that denote observable variables: behavior and environmental conditions, not internal mental states. From characterizing the phenomenon to be studied to offering an explanation, the behaviorist is committed to avoiding all terms that denote entities, quantities or interactions that are internal or unobservable.

A corollary of the thesis, which is frequently highlighted as an independent claim, is that introspection is not a scientific form of observation. One might argue (as historical figures like William James and William Wundt did–see “Error! Reference source not found.“ and “Error! Reference source not found.” p. Error! Bookmark not defined.) that internal states are scientifically observable via introspection.  Behaviorists, however, reject introspection as scientifically unreliable. Evidence from Wundt and James demonstrates, they argue, that introspective procedures produce different results for different practitioners, and scientific evidence should be replicable regardless of the practitioner.

Behaviorists disagree on whether internal mental states are non-existent fictions or merely unavailable to scientific inquiry; but that is not important here. What is important is that these putative internal mental states do not enter into the scientific study of behavior, or the scientific language that describes and explains behavior.

2.	The proper object of study for psychology is the organism and its environment. As a corollary of this insight, Behaviorists see behavior as the activity of an organism, not the activity of a mind. Psychology, for the behaviorist, is not the study of parts of an organism (such as the “ego,” “id,” and “superego”) and their relations, but rather the organism as a whole and its relationships with its environments.  And similarly, explanations offered by Behaviorists refer to organisms, behaviors and environmental conditions, not methods of repression and techniques of representation. Behaviorism restricts is object of study as well as its explanations to the macroscopic scale: things that can be directly observed by the naked eye. In the classical sense, Behaviorism rejects as non-scientific explanations in terms of or investigations into things that are larger (societies, cultures) or smaller (brains, neurons).

This thesis unites behaviorism with classical psychoanalysis in opposition to Jung, because it holds that all present behavior is the result of discrete learning events in the individual's past.   But unlike psychoanalytic explanations that posit unresolved psychic conflict to explain behavior, the behaviorist appeals only to previous learning experiences. To discover the reason for a given behavior then, is to discover the patterns of environmental reinforcement (called 'conditioning') that have caused the organism to learn this behavior. To cure a behavior is to 'extinguish' those conditioned responses in the organism or block those responses by substituting a new and novel response. Behaviorists hypothesize that learning can be physically realized in neurology, and hence, behaviorism is far more simple and plausible a theory than psychoanalysis, which cannot.

3.	The principles of learning are generalizable across species. Behaviorists argue that given that animals are incapable of introspection—or, if they are, they cannot communicate it—psychological theories that make use of introspection are incapable of explaining animal psychology.  Behaviorism, however, is not. Non-human animals are organisms living in environments that behave in certain regular ways. All of that is accessible to behavioristic science. And as it is an uncontroversial observation that at least some human behavior is the same as animal behavior (caring for the young, for example), it follows that behaviorism can explain regularities that introspective psychology cannot.

##### Learning

A behavioristic explanation of a given behavior takes the form of specifying the mechanism of learning that caused this behavior.  A behavioristic treatment seeks to 'extinguish' that behavior through providing an antithetical mechanism.

Learning mechanisms in behaviorism are built on the principles of reinforcement and extinction. Explanation of reinforcement and extinction are always specified in terms of stimulus and response. According to Watson, by 'stimulus' behaviorists “mean any object in the general environment or any change in the physiological condition of the animal, such as the change we get when we keep an animal from sex activity, when we keep it from feeding, when we keep it from building a nest.”  By 'response' behaviorists “mean that system of organized activity that we see emphasized anywhere in any kind of animal, as building a skyscraper, drawing plans, having babies, writing books, and the like.” (1929)

In recent years, B.F. Skinner has popularize operant conditioning and the idea of 'reinforcing' a behavior. Anything that increases the likelihood of a response given a stimulus is a reinforcement.  Positive reinforcement takes the form of adding some “rewarding” object to the environment when the desired response occurs.  “Negative” reinforcement usually means the removal of such objects.  Reinforcing objects need not be physical, tangible objects, but can something as intangible as the attention of a parent. “Punishment” is a negative condition applied to the organism following a behavior.

A decrease in the probability of a response given a stimulus over time is called extinction. In classical conditioning models of learning, the lack of repetitive exposure to reinforcement will result in progressive extinction of the conditioned response.

The mechanisms learning are:
* Classical conditioning, which is sometimes called 'past reinforcement,' occurs when an unconditioned stimulus, such as the presentation of food, causes an unconditioned ('natural') response, such as salivation. These 'natural' stimulus-response patterns are called “embryologic responses,” and they are raw material of a classical conditioning paradigm. In classical conditioning, the conditioning intervention in the embryological response occurs by pairing a 'conditioned stimulus' (such as the ringing of a bell) with the unconditioned stimulus. After repeated exposures, the original unconditioned response can be removed, and the response (now 'conditioned') will occur when the subject is presented with the conditioned stimulus. These basic pairings between conditioned stimuli and responses can be generalized over time, so that any loud noise, for example, may cause salivation.  
* Operant conditioning differs from classical conditioning insofar as the conditioning intervention occurs after the response, rather than concurrent with the unconditioned stimulus. Operant condition introduces the possibility of promised reinforcement, which would occur when the promise of future reinforcement causes behavior.

###### Behaviorism as a treatment in psychiatry

Behavioral treatments in psychiatry, like behaviorism in psychology, follows from a deceptively simple insight: that psychiatric treatment aims at the cessation of maladaptive behavior.  Like psychoanalysis, behavioral therapies restrict themselves to neurosis, not psychosis.

There are two major kinds of inhibition therapies found in the literature:

* Reciprocal inhibition, developed by Wolpe, involves diminishing the maladaptive behavior by conditioning a new behavior in response to a given stimulus that is incompatible with the undesired behavior. For reciprocal inhibition to work, the maladaptive behavior must be incompatible with the new conditioned behavior. Aversion therapy, which exposes the subject to the object of desire and conditions a new negative response, is a form of reciprocal inhibition.
* Transmarginal inhibition, also known as flooding, involves exposing the patient to strong examples of the stimuli for prolonged periods.

Other inhibition therapies, such as 'retroactive inhibition' are usually forms of reciprocal inhibition.

#### Cognitivists

Cognitivists reject the behaviorists' conjecture that scientific psychology is limited—as scientific psychology—to observable behavior. But neither do they seek to reestablish introspection as a valid observational method.  Cognitivists agree that scientific evidence must be observable. But they disagree that the explanations of behavior must necessarily be in terms of observable macro-objects like organisms and environments.  Cognitivists see the mind/brain as an information-processing system; therefore an adequate scientific explanations would take form of the specifying the mechanisms by which information is processed—including positing algorithms or modeling neural mechanisms that would generate the behavior in question. The difference between the Cognitivists and the Behaviorists is not about the experimental methods they follow, but rather about the structure of a scientific explanation.

Thus, cognitivism distinguishes itself from behaviorism in terms of a meta-theoretical thesis which rejects the half of the first behavioristic hypothesis that *internal entities are explanatorily irrelevant to psychology.* It does not reject the other three, or the corollary of the first, *that introspection is not a form of observation.*

Cognitivism grew slowly between 1955 and 1965, in part because it was not an 'intentional' revolution like Behaviorism. George Miller's 1956 paper “The magical number seven, plus or minus two: Some limits on our capacity for processing information,” is one of the classics of cognitive psychology, although the term 'cognitive psychology' does not appear in it (see Error! Reference source not found. on p. Error! Bookmark not defined.). Miller argues that  human's short-term memory behavior is limited to seven items plus or minus two.  These 'items', however, need not be individual atomic units like Ebbinghaus' nonsense syllables.  Miller hypothesized that brain could 'chunking' information into groups, which then could be easily remembered. To borrow a classic example from Bechtel and Graham, the sequence A, B, C, B, B, C, N, B, C, C, B, S would be difficult to remember on its own, but if it is 'chunked' into ABC, BBC, NBC, CBS, remembering it is simple. According to Miller, “There seems to be some limitation built into us either by learning or by design of our nervous system, al limit that keeps our channel capacities in this general range.” (1956, p. 86)  See Error! Reference source not found. on p. Error! Bookmark not defined. for a historical introduction. Miller's paper in included in the appendix.

            <Comments>'Neurotic' behavior results from continuing conflict between the libinal desires and the ego's repression techniques. 'Psychotic' behaviors result when the libinal desires assert their reality on the ego. See the discussion of 'neurosis' and 'psychosis' in the History of the Classification of Mental Illness section below.
The Introductory Lectures were published before Freud solidified the structural hypothesis using this terminology.  The beginnings of the idea, however, is present in the later chapters on neurosis: see, e.g. p. 437-438, where he describes the conflict between the 'libido' and the 'ego'.
The Introductory Lectures mention only repression, subdivided into 'condensation' and 'displacement' as mechanisms of the ego, but promises further work on the topic (p. 364-366). He began to develop a taxonomy of ego mechanisms later in his life, but the full-fledged taxonomy we see here was developed his daughter Anna Freud (1936). The Ego and and the Mechanisms of Defense. C. Baines (trans). Connecticut: International University Press.
In many works, including Psychopathology in Everyday Life, Introductory Lectures on Psychoanalysis and On the Interpretation of Dream, Freud provides the following outline of the kinds of commonality that underly symbolism: that of number (i.e. '3' and male genitalia), shape (i.e. long, straight objects such as sticks, umbrellas, posts, trees represent the male organ / hollowness or enclosing space such as vessels, bottles, boxes, trunks and ships symbolize female genitals; apples, peaches and fruit symbolize breasts), function (i.e. penetrating the body: knives, daggers, spears, sabers, firearms, rifles, pistols etc.; producing liquids, such as water-taps, water-cans, etc.; and being capable of lengthening or shortening, such as pencils, hanging-lamps, etc.; defying gravity (i.e. balloons, flying machines and zeppelins also represent the male organ). More complicated representations depend on personal associations with or reactions to objects: the complicated nature of landscapes mean they represent female bodies, sweets represent sexual satisfaction. Activities such as playing games, playing piano, sliding, gliding or pulling stand for masturbation because of the similarity of action. On the same note, rhythmic actions such as dancing, riding and climbing stand in for the sex act itself. Simple associations may appear as well: neckties, which are only worn by men, can symbolize men. (Introductory Lectures, p. 188-204)
see 290-294 of the DSM II, which is included in Appendix 6.
see 295-299 of the DSM II
See item 300 in the DSM II for the full taxonomy of neurosis.
There is something of a controversy over whether psychoanalysis can be used to treat psychosis. While many psychoanalysts believe psychosis and neurosis to be on a single spectrum of mental dysfunction, the psychotic patient's connection to reality is so tenuous that the techniques of free-association and transference threaten to develop the psychosis further, rather than dissolve it.
In Aristotlean metaphysics, the formal cause of something is the form of the thing whereas the immediate cause are the events that immediately proceeded the thing in question.  The form is the pattern or type of thing something is. The immediate cause is what brings that thing into being. In this context, the form distinguishes the type of neurosis, the immediate cause is what caused the neurosis to present at this moment.
As with most things in the history of ideas, even this definition is controversial.  I've chosen this definition, which reflects Skinner's presentation of Behaviorism in his 1953 Science and Human Behavior, chapter 1 because it is the most explicit and radical.  Watson defines that the goal of behaviorism as the “prediction and control of behavior,” (1913) leaving out observation. To understand the various different forms of behaviorism that have been posited since Watson's, please see Error! Reference source not found. on p. Error! Bookmark not defined.Psychoanalysts
See, for further explication of this claim, Skinner 1953, p. 27-31. Watson does not use the term 'inner state', but refers rather to 'consciousness', which he (possibly fallaciously) equates with the object of introspection. Thus, after objecting to the unreliability of introspective reports in a laboratory setting he claims “The time seems to have come when psychology must discard all references to consciousness; when it need no longer delude itself into thinking that it is making mental states the object of observation.”
Animals do not have superegos or techniques of repression, so the behaviors explained in psychoanalytic terms should not generalize across species. But they do. Therefore, psychoanalytic explanations are insufficient.
Watson seeks to eliminate the following misleading and unscientific terms from psychology: “consciousness, mental states, mind, content, introspectively verifiable, imagery, and the like.” (1913)
See, e.g. Watson 1913 “Introspection forms no essential part of its methods, nor is the scientific value of its data dependent upon the readiness with which they lend themselves to interpretation in terms of consciousness” and Skinner 1953 p. 30
Recall that Behaviorism was formed in the first half of the 20th century, when Hegelianism was a viable theory of social science. Behaviorists here are not rejecting the plausibility of modern social psychology, anthropology or sociology. They are rejecting the idea of a transcendent spirit that instantiates human culture.
See, e.g. Watson 1913 “The behaviorist, in his efforts to get a unitary scheme of animal response, recognizes no dividing line between man and brute.”

            <Text>#### Ethics of human research

Ethical codes of research have generally followed the discovery or publication of horrifically unethical experiments.  The most famous of these is probably the Nuremberg Code, adopted by the international medical community after the discovery of the Nazi 'experiments' performed on Jews, Homosexuals and Gypsies during the Holocaust.  The Nuremberg code is available online, and should be reviewed by anyone proposing an experiment or sitting on the Research Committee. See http://www.ushmm.org/research/doctors/Nuremberg_Code.htm.

##### The Nuremberg Code

The Nuremberg code lays out ten simple principles for design experiments on humans. They are:


&lt;!--\noindent\fbox{%
    \parbox{\textwidth}{%

1.	The voluntary consent of the human subject is absolutely essential. This means that the person involved should have legal capacity to give consent; should be so situated as to be able to exercise free power of choice, without the intervention of any element of force, fraud, deceit, duress, overreaching, or other ulterior form of constraint or coercion; and should have sufficient knowledge and comprehension of the elements of the subject matter involved as to enable him to make an understanding and enlightened decision. This latter element requires that before the acceptance of an affirmative decision by the experimental subject there should be made known to him the nature, duration, and purpose of the experiment; the method and means by which it is to be conducted; all inconveniences and hazards reasonably to be expected; and the effects upon his health or person which may possibly come from his participation in the experiment.

The duty and responsibility for ascertaining the quality of the consent rests upon each individual who initiates, directs, or engages in the experiment. It is a personal duty and responsibility which may not be delegated to another with impunity.

2.	The experiment should be such as to yield fruitful results for the good of society, unprocurable by other methods of means of study, and not random and unnecessary in nature.

3.	The experiment should be so designed and based on the results of animal experimentation and a knowledge of the natural history of the disease or other problem under study that the anticipated results will justify the performance of the experiment.

4.	The experiment should be so conducted as to avoid all unnecessary physical and mental suffering and injury.

5.	No experiment should be conducted where there is an a priori reason to believe that death or disabling injury will occur; except, perhaps, in those experiments where the experimental physicians also serve as subjects.

6.	The degree of risk to be taken should never exceed that determined by the humanitarian importance of the problem to be solved by the experiment.

7.	Proper preparations should be made and adequate facilities provided to protect the experimental subject against even remote possibilities of injury, disability or death.

8.	The experiment should be conducted only by scientifically qualified persons. The highest degree of skill and care should be required though all stages of the experiment of those who conduct or engage in the experiment.

9.	During the course of the experiment the human subject should be at liberty to bring the experiment to an end if he has reached the physical or mental state where continuation of the experiment seems to him to be impossible.

10.	During the course of the experiment the scientist in charge must be prepared to terminate the experiment at any stage, if he has probable cause to believe, in the exercise of the good faith, superior skill and careful judgment required of him that a continuation of the experiment is likely to result in injury, disability or death to the experimental subject.
}} --&gt;
The Nuremberg Code
##### The Declaration of Helsinki

In 1964, the medical community through the World Medical Association adopted the 'Declaration of Helsinki', which replaced the Nuremberg code as the standard for ethical experimentation on humans by the medical community. The World Medical Association still maintains the Declaration, adopting the most recent revisions in 2004. It is available online (http://www.wma.net/e/policy/b3.htm).

Psychiatrists, as practicing medical doctors, are bound by the Declaration of Helsinki. While it is far more complete than the Nuremberg code, the same basic ideas appear:

&lt;!--\noindent\fbox{%
    \parbox{\textwidth}{%


I. Basic Principles

   1. Biomedical research involving human subjects must conform to generally accepted scientific principles and should be based on adequately performed laboratory and animal experimentation and on a thorough knowledge of the scientific literature.

   2. The design and performance of each experimental procedure involving human subjects should be clearly formulated in an experimental protocol which should be transmitted to a specially appointed independent committee for consideration, comment and guidance.

   3. Biomedical research involving human subjects should be conducted only by scientifically qualified persons and under the supervision of a clinically competent medical person. The responsibility for the human subject must always rest with a medically qualified person and never rest on the subject of the research, even though the subject has given his or her consent.

   4. Biomedical research involving human subjects cannot legitimately be carried out unless the importance of the objective is in proportion to the inherent risk to the subject.

   5. Every biomedical research project involving human subjects should be preceded by careful assessment of predictable risks in comparison with foreseeable benefits to the subject or to others. Concern for the interests of the subject must always prevail over the interests of science and society.

   6. The right of the research subject to safeguard his or her integrity must always be respected. Every precaution should be taken to respect the privacy of the subject and to minimize the impact of the study on the subject's physical and mental integrity and on the personality of the subject.

   7. Physicians should abstain from engaging in research projects involving human subjects unless they are satisfied that the hazards involved are believed to be predictable. Physicians should cease any investigation if the hazards are found to outweigh the potential benefits.

   8. In publication of the results of his or her research, the physician is obliged to preserve the accuracy of the results. Reports of experimentation not in accordance with the principles laid down in this Declaration should not be accepted for publication.

   9. In any research on human beings, each potential subject mustbe adequately informed of the aims, methods, anticipated benefits and potential hazards of the study and the discomfort it may entail. He or she should be informed that he or she is at liberty to abstain from participation in the study and that he or she is free to withdraw visor her consent to participation at any time. The physician should then obtain the subject's freely given informed consent, preferably inheriting.

  10. When obtaining informed consent for the research project the physician should be particularly cautious if the subject is in dependent relationship to him or her or may consent under duress. In that case the informed consent should be obtained by a physician who isn't engaged in the investigation and who is completely independent of this official relationship.

  11. In case of legal incompetence, informed consent should be obtained from the legal guardian in accordance with national legislation. Where physical or mental incapacity makes it impossible to obtain informed consent, or when the subject is a minor, permission from the responsible relative replaces that of the subject in accordance with national legislation. Whenever the minor child is in fact able to give a consent, the minor's consent must be obtained in addition to the consent of the minor's legal guardian.

  12. The research protocol should always contain a statement of the ethical considerations involved and should indicate that the principles enunciated in the present declaration are complied with.

II. Medical Research Combined with Professional Care (Clinical Research)

   1. In the treatment of the sick person, the physician must be free to use a new diagnostic and therapeutic measure, if in his or her judgement it offers hope of saving life, re-establishing health or alleviating suffering.

   2. The potential benefits, hazards and discomfort of a new method should be weighed against the advantages of the best current diagnostic and therapeutic methods.

   3. In any medical study, every patient- including those of a control group, if any- should be assured of the best proven diagnostic and therapeutic method.

   4. The refusal of the patient to participate in a study must never interfere with the physician-patient relationship.

   5. If the physician considers it essential not to obtain informed consent, the specific reasons for this proposal should be stated in the experimental protocol for transmission to the independent committee (1, 2).

   6. The physician can combine medical research with professional care, the objective being the acquisition of new medical knowledge,only to the extent that medical research is justified by its potential diagnostic or therapeutic value for the patient.

III. Non-Therapeutic Biomedical Research Involving Human Subjects (Non-Clinical Biomedical Research)

   1. In the purely scientific application of medical research carried out on a human being, it is the duty of the physician to remain the protector of the life and health of that person on whom biomedical research is being carried out.

   2. The subjects should be volunteers- either healthy persons or patients for whom the experimental design is not related to the patient's illness.

   3. The investigator or the investigating team should discontinue the research if in his/her or their judgment it may, if continued, be harmful to the individual.

4.	In research on man, the interest of science and society should never take precedence over considerations related to the well-being of the subject.
}} --&gt; 

Table 2: Declaration of Helsinki

In the context of psychiatry, of course, the distinction made between therapeutic research and non-therapeutic research is crucially important.  If a psychiatric patient were to be deemed incapable of making an informed decision, and there is an experiment therapy that the psychiatrist believes may help, there are few ethical checks and balances to constrain the psychiatrist from performing unwarranted experiments.

##### The APA Ethical Standards for Psychologists

The APA Standards were first published in 1953. They were revised in 1959, 1963 and 1968. The 1968 standards, which should guide the research committee in determining which research programs should be allowed to move forward, are attached in the Appendix.

Most of the APA standards outline the responsibilities of psychologists who practice counseling and patient care.  While those are incredibly important, we're most concerned here with Principle 16: Research Precautions.  In 1959, section 16 was titled 'Harmful Aftereffect.' It read:


&lt;!--\noindent\fbox{%
    \parbox{\textwidth}{%

Principle 16. Harmful Aftereffects. Only when a problem is significant and can be investigated in no other way is the psychologist justified in giving misinformation to research subjects or exposing research subjects to physical or emotional stress.

a. When the possibility of serious aftereffects exists, research is conducted only when the subjects or the responsible agents are fully informed of this possibility and volunteer nevertheless.

b. The psychologist seriously considers the possibility harmful aftereffects and removes them as soon as permitted by the design of the experiment.

1.	c. A psychologist using animals in research adheres to the provisions of the Rules Regarding Animals, drawn up by the Committee on Precautions in Animal Experimentation and adopted by the American Psychological Association.
}} --&gt; 
Table 3: APA Ethical Standards: 1959

Four years later, in 1963, the committee responsible for the Ethical guidelines move the 'preamble' into a numbered point (a), changed the title to 'Research Precautions' and added a new preamble. It also changed the phrase 'is significant' to 'is of scientific significance'; ' can be investigated in no other way' became ' it is not practicable to investigate it in any other way'; ' giving misinformation to research subjects' was dropped; and the phrase 'whether children or adults' added to the new point (a). (b) added the qualification of  'reasonable' to 'possibility'; changed 'harmful' to 'injurious' and 'volunteer' became 'agree to participate'.  © changed 'removes' to 'avoids or removes'; and (d) were unchanged: (changes italicized)

&lt;!--\noindent\fbox{%
    \parbox{\textwidth}{%
Principle 16. Research Precautions. The psychologist assumes obligations for the welfare of his research subjects, both animal and human.

a. Only when a problem is of scientific significance and it is not practicable to investigate it in any other way is the psychologist justified in exposing research subjects research subjects, whether children or adults, to physical or emotional stress.

b. When the possibility of injurious aftereffects exists, research is conducted only when the subjects or the responsible agents are fully informed of this possibility and agree to participate nevertheless.

c. The psychologist seriously considers the possibility harmful aftereffects and avoids or removes them as soon as permitted by the design of the experiment.

2.	d. A psychologist using animals in research adheres to the provisions of the Rules Regarding Animals, drawn up by the Committee on Precautions in Animal Experimentation and adopted by the American Psychological Association.
}} --&gt; 
Table 4: APA Ethical Standards 1963

 These changed little between 1963 and 1968, except for the addition of  the qualifying phrase 'as part of the investigation' to (a) and adding provision (e) governing the use of psychoactive drugs:


&lt;!--\noindent\fbox{%
    \parbox{\textwidth}{%

3.	d. A psychologist using animals in research adheres to the provisions of the Rules Regarding Animals, drawn up by the Committee on Precautions in Animal Experimentation and adopted by the American Psychological Association.

e. Investigations of human subjects using experimental drugs (for example, hallucinogenic, psychotomimetic, psychedelic, or similar substances) should be conducted only in such settings as clinics, hospitals, or research facilities maintaining appropriate safeguards for the subjects.

The scientific investigation into the human mind and/or human behavior begins almost simultaneously with science itself.  We must then begin with the followers of Francis Bacon, and trace the idea that the mind is open to empirical inquiry through the empiricists into the present day.

Bacon, who we now credit with establishing 'The Scientific Method,' argued that the human mind tended to distort reality in regular, systematic ways, which he called 'idols.' In order to understand reality, we must then give up on the idea that a single person can discover the truth on his or her own. In order to learn about the world, we need to work together, collaboratively creating a “natural and experimental history” (Bk 2, Ch X, p 109) of the phenomenon.  As working collaboratively can lead to confusion and misunderstanding, we organize that natural and experimental history into a series of tables: including instances of the phenomenon's presence, closely related instances in which the phenomenon is absent, instances in which the phenomenon occurs in degrees or in comparison, and instances of exclusion of the phenomenon. Once these tables are built, we review them and create what Bacon called a 'first harvest' of the phenomenon. In short, this is a generalized axiom unifying the phenomenon yet held close to observation. Once that first axiom is established, we return to the tables, highlighting privileged instances which are further classified as solitary, transitory, revealing, etc. These, then can be used to further refine the first harvest into further, more careful axioms.

Bacon profoundly influenced Elizabethan England. His empirical method sparked inquiry in almost all areas of human knowledge, and formed the basis for what we now call the 'scientific revolution' or the 'enlightenment.' His influence on psychology and psychiatry is actually far more direct than most assume.  Late in his life, Bacon became good friends with the Philosopher Thomas Hobbes. In fact, Hobbes founded a Baconian reading group in Oxford, which is the forbearer of the Royal Society—the world's oldest scientific body.

Thomas Hobbes, who is most widely known for his initiation of social-contract theory in defense of absolute monarchy, opens his master work Leviathan with this bold claim:

&gt; Nature (the art whereby God hath made and governs the world) is by the *art* of man, as in many other things, so in this also imitated, that it can make an artificial animal.  For seeing life is but a motion of limbs, the beginning whereof is in some principal part within, why may we not say that all *automata* (engines that move themselves by springs and wheels as doth a watch) have an artificial life? For what is the *heart*, but a *spring*; and the *nerves*, but so many *strings*; and the *joints*, but so many *wheels*, giving motion to the whole body such was was intended by the artificer? (Ch 1, S1)

Just as his famous social-political philosophy posited universal laws of human conduct, Hobbes believed that the human mind followed to universal laws which were deducible through reason. To discover these laws, one must look at what separates humans (who have minds) from animals (who are supposed to not).  According to Hobbes, humans surpass animals insofar as they are “apt to inquire the consequences of it, and what effects he could do with it.”  In addition, humans can “can by words reduce the consequences he finds to general rules, called theorems, or aphorisms; that is, he can reason, or reckon, not only in number, but in all other things whereof one may be added unto or subtracted from another.” (Ch V, S6).  

Thus we have the beginning of psychology: human minds work by the process of deducing consequences and abstracting from particular experiences to general rules through basic logical functions. You may recall from the previous section that Hobbes was, in part, responding to Descartes' argument that the mind must be separate and distinct from the human body.

Descartes' most famous argument for mind-body dualism asks us to doubt all that cannot be known with certainty, and then concludes that one cannot doubt that one is doubting; hence thinking; hence one cannot doubt that one is a thinking thing.  This famous argument (called the “cogito” is contained the First Meditation. But Descartes offers a much more interesting and influential argument in a number of other writings. The argument appears twice in *The Discourse on Methods*, first in part 3:

&gt;...if there were such machines having the organs and the shape of a monkey or of some other animal that lacked reason, we would have no way of recognizing that they were not entirely of the same nature as these animals; where as, if there were any such machines that bore a resemblance to our bodies and imitated our actions as far as this is practically feasible, we would always have two very certain means of recognizing that they were not at all, for that reason, true men.  The first is that they could never use words or other signs, or put them together as we do in order to declare our thoughts to others.  For one can well conceive of a machine being so made that it utters words, and even that it utters words appropriate to the bodily actions that will cause some change in its organs... But it could not arrange its words differently so as to respond to the sense of all that will be said in its presence, as even the dullest men can do. (*Discourse*, Ch 3, 1637)

And then again in part 5:

&gt;[in looking at the body] I found there precisely all those things that can be in us without our thinking about them, and hence, without our soul's contributing to them, that is to say, that part distinct from the body of which it has been said previously that its nature is only to think.  And these are all the same features in which one can say that animals lacking reason resemble us.  But I could not on that account find there any of those functions, which, being dependent on thought, are the only ones that belong to us as men, although I did find them all later on, once I had supposed God created a rational soul and joined it to this body in particular manner that I described. (*Discourse*, Ch 5, 1637)

The same point appears in his *Letter to Henry More*:

&gt;Nevertheless it has never been observed that any brute beast arrived at such perfection that it could use true speech, that is, that it indicated by words or signs something that can be ascribed to thought alone, and not to a natural impulse.  For speech is the only certain sign of thought concealed in the body, and all men, even the stupidest and most insane, make use of it, but not any brute.  Therefore, this can be taken to be the true differentia between man and brutes (*Reply to Henry More*, S5)

In these passages, Descartes ascribes to humans alone the ability to use language and conceive of abstract ideas. He then finds that these abilities cannot be the products of material, finite reality. As experience is limited to finite reality, ideas of things that are not finite must be 'ascribed to thought alone.' Thus, these ideas must be innate to the mind and not based on experience. It  follows that that these distinctly human abilities are the products of a non-material infinite reality. In short, the argument is this:

1. Humans alone use language and conceive of abstract entities (i.e. 'infinity').
2. No material mechanism could ever use language or conceive of an abstract entity.
3. Therefore, humans cannot just be not material mechanism

Hobbes' assertion that human beings could be imitated through material mechanisms runs directly counter to Descartes' argument. But insofar it is only an assertion—a hypothesis—it needs empirical demonstration. To establish Hobbes' contention and meet Descartes' challenge scientifically, Hobbes must show a physical machine could, through experience, develop both the ability to speak rationally and conceive of abstract entities that are not clearly the product of experience (such as 'infinity').

It is easy to see how the process of 'addition and subtraction' could produce a concept of infinity. But it is hard to see how simple arithmetic could produce a machine that could “arrange its words differently so as to respond to the sense of all that will be said in its presence, as even the dullest men can do.”

Locke's famous *Essay on Human Understanding* opens with a fifty-eight page argument against the idea of innate ideas. Locke picks up the project where Hobbes left off, adding 'reflection' (what we now call 'introspection') as an additional source of ideas, but leaving the other main theses in place. For Locke, like for Hobbes , the mind is populated with ideas that originate in experience. We come to understand our minds, and how our minds occasionally lead us astray, by understanding the mental mechanisms that produce ideas from sensation. Abstract ideas like 'infinity' are the products of a process of abstraction:

&gt; Finite then, and infinite, being by the mind looked on as modifications of expansion and duration, the next thing to be considered, is, -How the mind comes by them.  As for the idea of the finite, there is no great difficulty...Every one that has an idea of any stated lengths of space, as a foot, finds that he can repeat that idea; and joining it to the former, make the idea of two feet; and by the addition of a third, three feet; and so on, without every coming to an end of his additions, whether of the same idea of a foot, or, if he pleases, of doubling it, or any idea he has of any length, as a mile, or diameter of the earth, or of the orbis magnus...This, I think, is the way whereby the mind gets the idea of infinite space. --Essay Book 2, Ch17

But like Hobbes, Locke fails to explain how language structure could be produced by a finite mechanism.

At the same time, Antione Arnaud, a fervent supporter of Descartes' theory of mind, was developing a school of thought in France which we now call the 'Port-Royalist' movement. The Port-Royalists held that the structure of grammar was universal for humans and could be reduced to the laws of logic. Unlike the empiricists Hobbes and Locke, however, the Port-Royalists, who including the great logician and mathematician Pascal, were dualists and theists. For the Port-Royalists, thought was different from language, although we tend to think in language through force of habit.  Pure thought, both in its content and its structure, becomes imperfect when 'translated' into an imperfect spoken language. A perfect language, and perfect grammar, would be possible if each word signified unequivocally a single simple idea, and the grammar of speech matched perfectly the 'grammar of thought.'

David Hume, the great Scottish Empiricist took the argument against innate ideas and married it to the idea of a universal structure of the mind. First, by extending the argument against innateness beyond the concept of the infinite:

&gt; The idea of God, as meaning an infinitely intelligent, wise, and good Being, arises from reflecting on the operations of our own mind, and augmenting, without limit, those qualities of goodness and wisdom. --Enquiry, S2 P14

And second, by advancing the thesis that principles of connection between ideas in the mind were regular and hence subject to empirical investigation. In fact, he posited three:  RESEMBLANCE, CONTIGUITY in time or place and CAUSE and EFFECT. (Treatise, Part 1, S IV). This thesis was supported by the universality of language structures:

&gt; It is evident that there is a principle of connexion between the different thoughts or ideas of the mind, and that, in the appearance to the memory or imagination, they introduce each other with a certain degree of method or regularity... ...Amoung different languages, even where we cannot suspect the least connexion or communication, it is found, that the words, expressive of ideas, the most compounded, do yet nearly correspond to each other: a certain proof that the simple ideas, comprehended in the compound ones, were bound together by some universal principle, which had an equal influence on all mankind.

Thus, with Hume, the empirical study of the mind begins in earnest, although 'psychology' was not distinguished from 'natural philosophy' for another century.

It is important to point out here that for these thinkers, the objects of study are *ideas*.  The central claim is that the relationships between ideas themselves, whether they be causal or grammatical, are regular and subject to law-like generalization. That central claim unites them with early psychology.  But as we will see, is the challenged in the Behaviorist revolution.

##### Birth – German Physiological Psychology in the 1880s-1890s.

In about 1847, four friends, three of them students of Johannes Müller (1801-1858), gathered together in Berlin to swear an oath dedicating themselves to undermining vitalism: the theory that all living entities shared a special irreducible ‘vital force.’  They committed themselves to the view that:

&gt;No other forces than the common physical-chemical ones are active within the organism. In those cases which cannot at the time be explained by these forces one has either to find the specific way or form of their action by means of the physical –mathematical method or assume new forces equal in dignity to the chemical-physical forces inherent in matter, reducible to the force of attraction and repulsion. (Ernst Jones, p. 40)


These four friends: Hermann von Helmholtz (1821-1894), Carl Ludwig (1816-1895), Emil du Bois-Reymond (1818-1896) and Ernst Wilhelm von Brücke (1819-1892), along with  Hermann Lotze (1817-1891) and his student Gustav Fechner (1801-1887), came to dominate the next generation of psychologist and psychiatrists: Helmholtz hired Christine Ladd-Franklin as his assistant, who went on to be one of the first woman member of the APA, and the first woman to hold a professorship at the University of Chicago. Freud studied under Brücke; Pavlov under Ludwig and Wundt under du Bois-Reymond. Wundt went on to work in Helmholtz’s lab after Ladd-Franklin returned to America.

While all four of these thinkers had a profound influence on the founding and development of psychology as a discipline, I'll focus my attention for the moment on Helmholtz.  

Helmholtz was one of the great scientific minds of his era. Not only is he now recognized as a godfather of experimental psychology, he is widely respected in the history or Optics, and is, in many ways, the father of ophthalmology, having invented the ophthalmoscope.

His professor, Müller, held that nerves had 'specific sense energies' naturally: our sensory system had certain a priori assumptions about time and space literally built into them, making sensory experience like binocular vision possible. Students familiar with the history of philosophy may recognize this as a position influenced by Kantian psychology.

Helmholtz, however, posited that our mental system as a whole adjusted itself through a process of 'unconscious inference' to represent the external world. Thus, the contents of our experiences were merely 'signs' or 'indicators' of the objects in the world that our experiences represent.  The  sensory system automatically and unconsciously recovered the world through the complex information it has available. The unconscious inferences that produce stable representations of the world are not transparent to our experience, but neither are they innate.  They are, in short, trained through experience with the regularities of the world itself. Thus, the process of sensation was learned, not biologically determined. While contemporary psychophysics has advanced greatly since 1850, the basic model of how perception works in psychology today is Helmholtz's.

###### Sensation and Perception: Fechner

On the morning of 22nd of October, 1850, a young physiologist named Gustav Theodor Fechner lay in bed, puzzled by the relationship between the intensity of a psychological experience (i.e. hearing a sound, measured by introspection) and the intensity of the physical stimulus (i.e. the amplitude of the air vibrations). On that morning, it occurred to him that the relative increase in the physical stimulus might correspond to the relative increase in the psychological experience.  It took him a decade to prepare the idea for publication, which he presented as 'Weber's law':

&lt;!--\[ dp  = k(dS/S) \]--&gt;
#
where dp is the change in the psychological experience, k is a constant to be determined experimentally, dS is the change in the stimulus and S is the stimulus. He added to this the idea that the physical stimulus must break a certain threshold to be perceivable at all to derive what is now known as 'Fechner's law’:

&lt;!--\[ p = k\ln(S/S_{0}) \] --&gt;
￼
Wehere S0 is the threshold under which the stimulus is not perceived.

Fechner's law is the first mathematical law (some might say 'model') in psychology.  It posits a specific relationship between a psychological entity (sensation) and a physical entity (the stimulus).  Unlike his predecessors who had contented themselves with discovering the relationships between ideas in a rather imprecise way, Fechner had both bridged the divide between the psychological and the physical, and given that bridge the precision of Calculus.  

Fechner's book, Elements of Psychophysics, published in 1860 had a profound effect in both German and England.  Physiologists now had a model of precision for which they could strive. And psychologists had a model of understanding the relationships between the physical and the psychological. Most importantly, however, the book inspired Hermann Ebbinghaus to begin studying memory.  But that story will have to be left to another time.

###### Introspection: Wundt

Today, we generally consider Wilhem Wundt's lab at Leipzig to be the first true psychological laboratory.  Helmholtz's lab, it is argued, was a lab of physiology, not psychology.  Wundt, unlike Helmholtz, believed that the causal relations governing consciousness were of a different kind than those governing the 'external' world.  And it was the challenge of psychology to explain those regularities.

Wundt was, however, a student of the physiologist Helmholtz. Thus, a proper explanation of the laws of psychology would make use of the properties of the central nervous system. In Wundt's own words:

&gt;Physiology and psychology cover, between them, the field of vital phenomena; they deal with the facts of life at large, and in particular with the facts of human life. Physiology is concerned with all those phenomena of life that present themselves to us in sense perception as bodily processes, and accordingly form part of that total environment which we name the external world. Psychology, on the other hand, seeks to give account of the interconnection of processes which are evinced by our own consciousness, or which we infer from such manifestations of the bodily life in other creatures as indicate the presence of a consciousness similar to our own. (1902, p. 1)

Shortly thereafter, he asserts that Psychology is “the investigation of conscious process in the modes of connection peculiar to them.” (1902, p. 2) As consciousness is unique in the world, it can only, then, be approached with the investigative tools unique to consciousness: direct experience of consciousness by ourselves of inferred in others on the basis of direct observation and analogy.

This does not mean, however, that a science of psychology is purely introspective. On the contrary, Wundt proposed a 'physiological psychology': a theory of conscious experience informed by our physiological understanding of the brain, what Wundt calls the 'bodily substrate of mental life.'

The nervous system was thought to be made up of a 'central substance' that maintained an equilibrium and 'nerve-fibres' that connected cells together. This 'central stuff' was understood not to just transmit information, but to modify it in one of two ways: first, if it were exposed to repeated stimulus, the amount of energy needed to produce a response would decrease, and second, in some cases, it could invert the signal into it's opposite (i.e. from 'x more than equilibrium' to 'x less than equilibrium'). Wundt sought to reduce the four standard 'Laws of Association' of ideas—similarity, contrast, spatial and temporal contiguity— to simple 'internal connection', as 'contrast' is a completion of an idea in the same way 'similarity' is; and contiguity in space and time are external, not internal, relationships. Ideas tend to produce their contrasting idea, rather than ideas which are similar, when they are accompanied by strong feelings, as all feelings have a kind of 'elasticity' to them, always presenting with its opposite feeling implicitly.

'Internal connection,' is then is explained by what Wundt called 'central innervation,' or the properties of the nervous system.  It is a fundamental law of neuroscience, even then, that 'neurons that wire together fire together.'  For Wundt and his followers, the similarity and contrast of ideas was explainable by the excitation and inhibition properties of these nerves.

###### Behavior: Pavlov

Ivan Pavlov was, like the others in this section, a physiologist first. His interest in psychology was, for the most part, tangential to his work in physiology. Between 1891 and 1900, Pavlov conducted a series of experiments on salivation in dogs. His primary interest at this time was to explain why dogs salivated when presented with food at a distance. The common-sense psychological explanation, of course, is that the dog wants the food. More technically, early psychologists would have said the dog associates food and saliva (even it it is unconscious). But those are not an acceptable physiological explanations, and they wouldn't satisfy Pavlov.

Using a recently invented apparatus, Pavlov was able to measure the amount of saliva dogs produced in response to a food stimulus. After a number of experiments, Pavlov noticed that the dogs were salivating without any food present. It occurred to him that in these case, the dogs' salivation response might be responding to the lab techs, rather than food itself. To test this hypothesis, he presented food to a dog and simultaneously rang a bell. After repeated exposures to this combination of stimuli, Pavlov removed the food, leaving just the bell. He found that the dogs still salivated.

Thus, Pavlov discovered what came to be called 'classical conditioning': to train a behavior, one presents a new stimulus (the conditioned stimulus) concurrently with the stimulus that 'naturally' produces the desired behavior (the unconditioned stimulus). After repeated training, the desired behavior (conditional response) will occur with the new (conditioned) stimulus, without the presence of the original, 'natural,' unconditioned stimulus.

Pavlov's primary application of his findings were to the nervous system as a whole as well as “heart, digestive tract and other organs in the higher animals” (lecture 23), he didn't shy away from suggesting that it could be used to explain the seemingly involuntary habitual actions of those deemed 'psychotic' or 'neurotic.' Conditional responses were, however, breakable, or in behaviorists terms 'extinguishable,' if one conditioned a new stimulus in place of the existing stimulus-response association.

Pavlov placed particular emphasis on the idea that his experiments were purely objective and not  open to observer influence, such as the experiments of the introspectivists. In fact, he closes his 1927 lectures with the bold claim that:

&gt;all the experiments, those of other workers as well as our own, which have set as their object a purely physiological interpretation of the activity of the higher nervous system, I regard as being in the nature only of a preliminary inquiry, which has however, I fully believe, entirely justified its inception. We have indisputably the right to claim that our investigation of this extraordinarily complex field has followed the right direction, and that, although not a near, nevertheless a complete, success awaits it.

The importance of Pavlov's theorizing should be obvious at this point: classical conditioning provided a physiological law-like relationship that could take the place of (provide the bodily substrate for) association of ideas. And it provides a mechanisms for creating, intervening in, or destroying those associations—which no previous theory had managed to do thus far.
##### American Psychology: William James and the function of consciousness

During this period of profound growth in psychology in Germany, American Universities were not institutions of Research, but institutions of liberal education. Starting in 1876 that started to change, when Johns Hopkins University was founded in Baltimore with the explicit mission of "The encouragement of research; the encouragement of young men; the advancement of individual scholars, who by their excellence will advance the sciences they pursue, and the society where they dwell" (Daniel Coit Gilman, the first President of Johns Hopkins who greatly admired the German university.)

Of the 53 men to the faculty of Hopkins by 1884, nearly all had been educated at German Universities, and 13 held what was then a German degree, the PhD Josiah Royce, progenitor of American Hegelianism, graduated from Hopkins in 1878. The few exceptions to this rule were the eminent American pragmatists John Dewey and C.S. Peirce.  

What followed can only be described as an explosion in research universities in America. Clark University was founded in 1887 and the University of Chicago in 1892.  In 1860, no PhDs were awarded in America. By 1890, 164 PhDs had been given. The first of these in ‘Psychology’ was given to G. Stanley Hall by Harvard in 1878.

I mention all of this because the German understanding of the science of the mind—specifically that of Helmholtz and his anti-vitalists—became synonymous with the understanding of research in Psychology during this period. In short, if one approached the mind in some fashion other than this experimental tradition, it simply was viewed as not contributing to research, and hence, was not considered suitable for graduate instruction. More often that not, advocates for views not in accordance with physiological-psychology were restricted to departments of philosophy or anthropology. A particularly good example of this kind of reasoning is G. Stanley Hall’s 1879 paper ‘Philosophy in the United States,’ in which he laments American Philosophy as little more mental discipline and moral training in the Christian tradition.

In the middle of this storm sits William James. James, in many ways, bridges the divide between the older approach to liberal education and the new university approach to research. James’ accredits his interest in Psychology to his time spent in Germany, yet his entire career was spent teaching at the traditional college: Harvard. He advocated for experimentalists, but appeared to perform no psychological experiences himself. His students are the major figures in this first generation of research institutions and Psychology departments, including G. Stanley Hall; yet his position was always in the department of Philosophy, something he appeared to have insisted upon. James had a life-long friendship with the two Hopkins pragmatists, C.S. Peirce and John Dewey, who went on to supervise Christine Ladd-Franklin at Hopkins. Moreover, James was in frequent contact with the early British philosophers of mind including Alexander Bain, Herbert Spencer and John Sully.  

In 1878 James contracted with Henry Holt and company to write a textbook for this nascent field of psychology. The resultant book The Principles of Psychology is a classic in the field.  In it, James defines psychology as “the science of mental life, both of its phenomena and of their conditions” (1890, p. 1) and identified introspection as its chief method.

James held that consciousness (which was the central phenomenon to be studied by psychology) was like stream, encompassing much more than mere ‘associations’ of ideas. The associationists who followed Hume isolated experiences from their context, and provided a overly simplistic account. The object of study of psychology—the relations, tendencies and emotions that make up the stream of consciousness—are directly experienced in introspection, and form the basis of genuine scientific inquiry into the mind.

James' fellow pragmatists Peirce and Dewey went on to construct a theory of psychology focused on the  functions of mental states, what was called ultimately called “The Chicago School.” Dewey argued that explanations of human activity that focused merely on the 'stimulus' and 'response' or 'reflex arcs' were inadequate characterizations of conscious states. In order to truly characterize, and then study, conscious states, science must take into account the function or end of those states. In his words:

&gt;the distinction of sensation and movement as stimulus and response respectively is not a distinction which can be regarded as descriptive of anything which holds of psychical events or existences as such. The only events to which the terms stimulus and response can be descriptively applied are to minor acts serving by their respective positions to the maintenance of some organized coördination. The conscious stimulus or sensation, and the conscious response or motion, have a special genesis or motivation, and a special end or function. The reflex arc theory, by neglecting, by abstracting from, this genesis and this function gives us one disjointed part of a process as if it were the whole. (1896, p. 370)

Functional psychology thus emphasizes the role mental entities play in an organisms behavior, not what those ideas represent, or the 'content' of those ideas. (Dewey, 1903, p. 114)
##### Experimentalism: Ebbinghaus and the unreliability of introspection

In or about 1878, inspired by Fechner's stunning results investigating sensation, Hermann Ebbinghaus started experimenting with memory. Ebbinghaus sought, like all of his contemporaries, to understand the association of ideas.  But he was worried, rightfully so, that using existing words or concepts in an experimental design would allow for the individual subject's previous experience with those words or concepts to influence the result of the experience. Thus, to isolate the association of ideas from any prior influence, he created long lists of nonsense syllables (VAM, ZOK, etc.) and set about memorizing them. He then precisely measured the number of repetitions or amount of time it took to repeat list perfectly, something he called trials to criterion.  As it turns out, the longer the list, the more time, or trials, it takes to memorize it.  But that wasn't all: he further tested the process of forgetting.

After some arbitrary period, Ebbinghaus would return to the same list and restart the entire process. If it took him the same number of repetitions to memorize the list to perfection, his forgetting would have been complete.  What Ebbinghaus found was that even if he could not introspectively recall items on the list after some time, it took fewer repetitions for him to learn the list to the criterion or perfection. Thus, a decade before Freud made it fashionable to believe in the unconscious, Ebbinghaus had demonstrated empirically that the mind could retain information that it could not bring to subjective, introspective awareness.

This discovery was a bombshell to the introspective protocols of Wundt and James. Pavlov had shown that 'unconscious' behaviors like salivation could be trained to a stimulus without the intervention of introspection, but Ebbinghaus showed that a paradigmatic psychological phenomenon—memory—was subject to the same training. While Ebbinghaus' work was originally published in 1885 in German, it Is little coincidence that it was translated into English in 1913, the same year Watson declared the beginning of the Behaviorist revolution.
##### The First Revolution: Behaviorism

John B. Watson (1878-1958) opens his 1913 manifesto “Psychology as the Behaviorist Views it.” with the bold claim that Psychology

&gt;“is a purely objective branch of natural science. Its theoretical goal is the prediction and control of behavior. Introspection forms no essential part of its methods, nor is the scientific value of its data dependent upon the readiness with which they lend themselves to interpretation in terms of consciousness. The behaviorist, in his efforts to get a unitary scheme of animal response, recognizes no dividing line between man and brute. The behavior of man, with all of its refinement and complexity, forms only a part of the behaviorist's total scheme of investigation.” (1913, p. 158)

In his 1929 debate with the Harvard professor and physiological-psychologist William MacDougall (1871-1938), Watson anticipated a common criticism of behaviorism: that it cannot explain our rich interior mental life—what William James called the “stream of consciousness.” Watson responded that if we were to take the inner mental life as the object of study, rather than observable behaviors, there would be “as many analyses as there are individual psychologists. There is no element of control. There is no way of experimentally attaching and solving psychological problems and standardizing methods.” Thus, psychologists must limit themselves to “things that can be observed, and formulate laws concerning only the observed things.” (1929)

According to Watson, ‘observable things’ includes only “what the organism says or does,” which must then be described “in terms of ‘stimulus and response.’”  By ‘stimulus,’ Watson means “any object in the general environment or any change in the physiological condition of the animal, such as the change we get when we keep an animal from sex activity, when we keep it from feeding, when we keep it from building a nest. By response we mean that system of organized activity that we see emphasized anywhere in any kind of animal, as building a skyscraper, drawing plans, having babies, writing books, and the like.”

Watson’s behaviorism explains the behavior of all organisms (not just humans) by producing laws of correlation between stimuli and responses. This was a massive extension of the field of psychology, as animals and babies were not able to give introspective reports. Following Pavlov, Watson contends that an organism initially engages is some random behavior (say, a baby squirming) in response to a stimulus. This ‘unconditioned response’ may be biologically determined, but it is not yet a law of psychology.  To ‘condition’ a response, one presents the unconditioned stimulus along with a new stimulus repeatedly. Over time, the organism responds to the new, conditioned stimulus with the original unconditioned response. Thus, to explain any given behavior, one must find the conditioned stimulus that is now correlated with the conditioned response.

MacDougall, among others, challenged Watson to explain “thinking” or “thought”  in terms of stimulus and response.  Watson does not shy away from this challenge:

&gt; “The increasing dominance of language habits in the behavior of the developing child leads naturally over into the behaviorist's conception of thinking.  The behaviorist makes no mystery of thinking.  He holds that thinking is behavior, is motor organization, just like tennis playing or golf or any other form of muscular activity. But what kind of muscular activity? The muscular activity that he uses in talking. Thinking is merely talking, but talking with concealed musculature.”

According to Watson, a child initiates verbal behavior by talking aloud to and about his surroundings. As that behavior is negatively reinforced, it changes to mumbling to oneself, and ultimately to keeping one's lips closed. It follows that thinking is not an activity of the mind/brain alone, but a kinesthetic experience of the entire organism—in short, a behavior.  Words are, in Watson's view “the conditioned substitutes for our world of objects and acts. Thinking is a device for manipulating the world of objects when those objects are not present to the senses.”

###### Maturation of Behaviorism: Tolman and Hull 
During the middle of the 20th century, behaviorism in American divided roughly into two camps: Tolman and Hull. Edward Chace Tolman (1886 – 1959) initiated the 'war' in 1922 by criticizing  Watson. Tolman argued that Watson's belief that all human behavior could be explained in terms of “muscle contraction and grand secretion, as such, would not be behaviorism at all but a mere physiology.” (1922, p. 45)

For Tolman, a behavioristic science must answer three major problems: “(1), given the stimulating agency, determining the behavior-cues (2), given the behavior-cues, determining the behavior-object and (3), given the behavior-object, determining the behavior-act.” (p. 51).  (1) is the problem of psychophysics, which is adequately solved by Fechner. (2) is accessible, with rewording, by classical conditioning. (3) is the “important problem of motive.” A proper science of behavior must answer all three of these problems. Doing so, Tolman contends, would allow the behaviorist to understand and better elucidate introspection.

Opposing Tolman, Clark Hull (1884 – 1952) contended that in order for a postulate or theorem to be “truly scientific,” it must “take the form of specific statements of the outcome of concrete experimentations or observations.” Simple classification of behavior are not, themselves, scientific. But neither is talk of such things as motives.  Scientific explanations must make use of clear, unambiguous terms that refer to  observable behavior. Everything else is simply not considered to be 'science.' Hull contends that psychology should produce mathematical equations that would specify precisely all the  relationships between variables that account for an organisms behavior. The specific behavior of a given organism would be an instance of these universal mathematical generalizations.

Hull's primary contribution to behaviorism is the thesis that that the when a given stimulus has the effect of reducing a biological need, the connection between the stimulus and the response is strengthened automatically. While that statement may seem like a commonsense position today (food given as a reward, e.g.), the important part of it in 1935 was the word of 'automatically.' Contrary to the introspectivists or even commonsense, one need not be aware of the satiation of one's physical desires in order to strengthen the association between the conditioned stimulus and the conditional response. In fact, most conditioned associations are not accessible to introspective awareness.

Methodologically, Hull's insistence on the mathematical-deductive structure of theory led to a cadre of young psychologists who were able to represent complex relationships between variables mathematically.  Many members of that generation—including Roger Shepard—ended up at Stanford, ultimately providing much of the theory of information processing that allowed the cognitivists to advance sophisticated mathematical and computer models of cognitive states.

In response to Hull, Tolman argued that simple stimulus-response connections were insufficient to explain behavior: specifically rats running a maze for a food reward.  In his famous 1948 paper “Cognitive Maps in Rats and Men,” Tolman presented evidence that showed rats that were allowed to wander around a maze randomly before the beginning of training period learned the maze more quickly than rats that began training without prior exposure to the maze. Tolman argued that the best explanation for this phenomenon—and our general intuition about why rats appear to pause before beginning down a specific course—is that the rats have built up a 'cognitive map' of the maze through their random explorations.  He goes so far as to suggest that the rats had the ability to learn through 'Vicarious Trial and Error,' or 'imagining' what would happen if they responded to a particular stimulus.  For Tolman, this was:

&gt;evidence that in the critical stages-whether in the first picking up of the instructions or in the later making sure of which stimulus is which-the animal's activity is not just one of  responding passively to discrete stimuli, but rather one of the active selecting and comparing of stimuli. (1948, p. 200)

One of Tolman's students, Ritchie, constructed further experiments to test the capacity of the rats' cognitive maps. By starting rats on the far side of the laboratory, Ritchie found that the rats tended to navigate not by the direct path to the reward, but to the walls of the room itself. Thus, Tolman contends, the rats' cognitive maps were 'strip-like' and 'narrow.'

It is this concept—the breadth or narrowness of cognitive maps—that allows Tolman to extrapolate to the human mind, going so far to suggest that we may interpret the various psychological mechanisms posited by psychoanalysts as “narrowings of our cognitive maps due to too strong motivations or too intense frustration.” Thus, racists, sexists, pathological patriots, etc. are individuals with too narrow a 'cognitive map.' A healthy mind—and a well educated person—is one who can use reason, i.e. “broad cognitive maps” to

&gt;“look before and after, learning to see that there are often round-about and safer paths to their quite proper goals-learn, that is, to realize that the well-beings of White and of Negro, of Catholic and Protestant, of Christian and of Jew, of American and Russian (and even of males and females) are mutually interdependent.” (208) 

###### Radical Behaviorism: Skinner

Starting in 1938, Behaviorism underwent a radical transformation.  In that year, Burrhus Frederic Skinner (1904 – 1990) published The Behavior of Organisms: An Experimental Analysis, in which he introduced the idea of operant conditioning.  Skinner's insight was not entirely without precedent, but rather built upon the concept of 'instrumental conditioning' originally introduced by Edward Thorndike (1874-1949).  

According to what is now called 'Thorndike's law of effect', if a response is followed closely by a pleasurable experience, it is more likely to be associated with the stimulus than if it is followed by a unpleasurable or neutral experience. Skinner turned this idea into the central explanatory mechanism of behaviorism: rather than the conditioned stimulus occurring simultaneously with the unconditioned stimulus, the conditioning stimulus occurs immediately after the desired behavior as a consequence of the desired behavior. In his own words:

&gt;Operant behavior usually affects the environment and generates stimuli which is “feed back” to the organism. Some feedback may have the effects identified by the layman as reward or punishment.  Any consequence of behavior which is rewarding or, more technically, reinforcing increases the probability of further responding. (1957 / 1972, p. 129)

By introducing the idea of reinforcement of a behavior as whatever makes it more likely that that behavior will occur, Skinner was able to undercut Tolman's (and MacDougall's before him) insistence that a purpose or goal was required to explain the behavior of animals.

As a boy, Skinner was fascinated with mechanisms.  Legend has it that he even built a steam cannon out of a discarded water boiler. Extraordinarily intelligent, Skinner found Francis Bacon's works at about fourteen, and became enamored with the idea that Bacon may have written Shakespeare's plays.  He majored in English and literature at Hamilton College, where he became famous for elaborate practical jokes.  During his time at Hamilton, he expressed significant interest in the authors Joyce and Proust – but also physiological psychologists Pavlov and Jacques Loeb. Legend has it that he met Robert Frost, who encouraged him to become a writer.   After that did not pan out, he returned to behaviorism through the work of Bertrand Russell – specifically Russell's comparison between 'reflex' and 'force' in physics.

Inspired by Pavlov's maxim “control the environment and you will see order in behavior,” as well as his passion for inventing mechanisms, Skinner began to create machines that would control behavior of an organism by automatically rewarding the desired behavior and punishing behavior that was not desired.

These successes led Skinner to hypothesize that all animal behavior—including human behavior—resulted from such forces. He delineated four types of operant conditioning: positive reinforcement, negative reinforcement, punishment and extinction, which he studied with mathematical precision. Skinner shifted behaviorism's emphasis from reflexes to regularities of the whole organism, moving from the causal link between stimulus and response to the relationship between the response and its reinforcement.

According to Skinner, this form of behaviorism was the inevitable development of psychology into a full-fledged science. Often pulling on an analogy to the history of physics, chemistry and biology, he argued that 'consciousness' and 'inner causes' were the remnants of superstition, and human psychology and society could be perfected through the principles of operant conditioning.  

Skinner adamantly insisted that scientific inquiry could not countenance hypothetical unobservable entities. Following Russell, Skinner argued that explaining a given behavior, such as 'eating,' in terms of a mental state, such as 'being hungry,' was ad hoc, equivalent to the pre-scientific explanation of physical events in terms of vitalistic 'forces.'  For example, if I explain why a glass breaks by referring to it's fragility, I've really explained nothing at all—I've only explained breaking in terms of being likely to break.  A genuine explanation of a glass's breaking is in terms of the environmental conditions and events immediately prior to the breaking of the glass. Likewise, explaining eating in terms of 'hunger' is hollow, repeating only the likelihood of eating behavior.

 Throughout his career, Skinner argued that radical behaviorism alone was the scientific approach to psychology. Theories—including Hull's—cannot refer to underlying entities. When one objects that paradigmatic sciences like physics postulate unobservable underlying entities such as electrons, Skinner retorts that these are not believed by physics to really exist, but are merely convenient placeholders for the mathematical relationships that hold between observable entities. A scientist must restrict his or her work to observation, not theorizing. In retrospective appraisal of his own work, Skinner would claim of his work in Behavior of Organisms:

&gt;The notes, data, and publications which I have examined do not show that I ever behaved in the manner of Man Thinking as described by John Stuart Mill or John Dewey or in reconstructions of scientific behavior by other philosophers of science.  I never faced a Problem which was more than the eternal problem of finding order. I never attacked a problem by constructing a Hypothesis.  I never deduced Theorems or submitted them to Experimental Check. So far as I can see, I had no preconceived Mode of behavior—certainly not a physiological or mentalistic one and, I believe, not a conceptual one.” (1972, p. 112)

In the years following, Behaviorism came to utterly dominate American Psychology.  By 1960, for example, the standard textbook for experimental psychology, Burton G. Andreas' Experimental Psychology could confidently assert:

Psychology seeks to express the laws of behavior. It makes the assumption that all aspects of behavior, like other natural phenomena, are dependent on the conditions under which the behavior occurs... Psychology seeks to describe the dependence of the activities of people or animals on their environments and states of being. Psychology's place is delineated by this particular goal and the specific techniques devised for striving toward it. (1960, p. 4)

##### Concurrent developments: Logic and Computing

In 1812, George Boole (1815-1864) published The Laws of Thought, which is now regularly classified as a classic work in Logic. The opening paragraph, however, suggests a different discipline:

&gt; The design of the following treatise is to investigate the fundamental laws of those operations of the mind by which reasoning is performed; to give expression to them in the symbolic language of a Calculus, and upon this foundation to establish the science of Logic and construct its method; to make that method itself the basis of a general method for the application of the mathematical doctrine of Probabilities; and, finally, to collect from the various elements of truth brought to view in the course of these inquiries some probable intimations concerning the nature and constitution of the human mind. -- Laws of Thought (1854) Ch1 Para1

Boole, like his predecessor David Hume, believed that the rules that regulate the human mind were simple, and complex ideas were structured out of simple ones in the same way complex theorems are constructed out of simple axioms via logical transformations.

The history of Logic is of great importance here because in 1950, a brilliant young logician named Alan Turing proposed a theoretical physical machine that would be capable of carrying out logical functions.  That theoretical machine ultimately became the digital computer we know today.

He further proposed that such a machine could be taught to understand human language, and one could test the sophistication of that teaching by a simple empirical test, now known as the 'Turing test.'  An interviewer would have a conversation with two individuals, one human and one computer, for a period of time. If, after five minutes or so, the interviewer could not tell the difference between the two, we would be in a position of calling the machine a 'thinking' machine.  According to Turing:

&gt;“I believe that in about fifty years' time it will be possible, to programme computers, with a storage capacity of about 109, to make them play the imitation game so well that an average interrogator will not have more than 70 per cent chance of making the right identification after five minutes of questioning.”

In short, Turing's ideal machine would 'respond to the sense of all that will be said in its presence, as even the dullest men can do.'   The challenge set by Descartes and dreamt about by Hobbes, Locke and Hume to create a physical device capable of using language in a productive and systematic way was met, at least, theoretically, by the digital computer.

The question that remains for you, in the course of this game, is whether or not Turing's discovery of the logical functions that meet Descartes' challenge in fact lead to, in Boole's words “probable intimations concerning the nature and constitution of the human mind,” and whether or not those 'probable intimations' are scientific in nature.

##### The Second Revolution: Cognitive Science

In 1957, two books were published on the topic of language use by humans. As we've discussed, philosophers of mind have long considered language-use the defining characteristic of humanity.  The empirical study of language-use therefore, has the potential to quantify, analyze and observe, with scientific reliability, what we are as human beings.

In the first, Verbal Behavior, B.F. Skinner explained humans' language use in terms of operant conditioning.  Verbal behavior is particularly interesting for the behaviorist because it isn't directly reinforced by the world, but rather mediated by another person via his or her own verbal behavior. In fact, this unique feature comes to form Skinner's definition of verbal behaviors: those behaviors that are 'reinforced through the mediation of other persons' (1957, p. 2). He later refines and restricts that definition thus: “If we make the further provision that the 'listener' must be responding in ways which have been conditioned precisely in order to reinforce the behavior of the speaker, we narrow our subject to what is traditionally recognized as the verbal field.” (p. 225) This definition, you'll no doubt notice, makes no reference to vocalization, words, sentences, thoughts, phonems, meanings, semantics, grammar, or anything else typically associated with language-behavior.

The second was Noam Chomsky's Syntactic Structures. Chomsky opens his first masterwork by noting that the set of all grammatical sentences in any given language, while infinite, is not random. There are sentences like 'Colorless green ideas sleep furiously' which may have never occurred in English before 1957, but nonetheless are grammatical sentences; while at the same time, there are sentences like 'Furiously sleep ideas green colorless' that are not grammatical. He then proposes that an adequate theory of language ought to describe a device that generates all and only the sentences that are grammatical in that language. Any theory that can't generate the set of grammatical sentences simply is not an adequate explanation of human language-behavior.

Central to Chomsky's theory is the thesis that humans differ from animals in their ability to use language. You'll remember from the beginning of this history that that view was shared by Rene Descartes and the Port-Royalists, who used it to argue for the distinction between the soul (mind) and the body.  It is not a view held by the Behaviorists.  For Chomsky, however, the ability to use language does not entail a non-physical being. Turing's machines showed that a physical entitled generate new and novel sentences that follow the grammatical structures. Verbal behavior, the defining feature of human psychology, is the ability to structure sentences in new and novel ways via the process of recursion, but that does not mean that human minds are non-physical entities.

Not only do the cognitivists reject the behaviorists conjecture that one can explain human behavior without reference to internal states, they reject the behaviorists rejection of the thesis that there is a dividing like between “man and brutes.”

In 1959, Chomsky published a vitriolic review of Skinner's Verbal Behavior, in which he claimed that not only were Skinner's definitions of reinforcement and conditioning either confused or circular, he argues that empirically, children learn grammar at a higher rate than can be explained by operant conditioning. It is included in the appendix.

In the decade before these tumultuous years, The Macy foundation had sponsored series of conferences that introduced some of great early mathematicians and computer scientists including John von Neumann (father of most computer languages), Norbert Wiener (founder of cybernetics), Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts (who together created a mathematical model of a neuron, which is the basis for all neural network architecture), Julian Bigelow and Arutuo Rosenblueth (also pioneering cyberneticists) to the great social scientists and psychologists of the day, including the anthropologist Margaret Mead, the Gestalt psychologist Wolfgang Köhler among others. The goal of these workshops was to investigate the similarities between computational machines and human minds and social structures.  Behaviorists almost never attended. While the results from these conferences were minimal, they set the stage for MIT's second Symposium on Information theory, September 10-12 1956, that forever changed forever the face of psychology.  

At that conference, Alan Newell and Herbert Simon, the great computer scientists from Carnegie-Melon, presented a simple machine that could do logic proofs and Noam Chomsky presented his idea of a transformative-generative grammar as the basis of language. George Miller writes, in an unpublished paper presented at MIT and repeatedly cited by historians of cognitive science, that he came away from the conference with a sense “more intuitive than rational, that human experimental psychology, theoretical linguistics, and the computer simulation of the cognitive process were all the pieces from a larger whole, and that the future would see a progressive elaboration and coordination of their shared concerns.”  Miller recalls Newell telling him “Chomsky was developing exactly the same kind of ideas for language that he and Herb Simon were developing for theorem-proving.”

And so began 'the Cognitive Revolution”.

            <Comments>The four idols distinguished by Bacon are the idols of the tribe, the cave, the marketplace and the theater.  The idols of the tribe are those which we all share, as a function of our biology. They “have their origin either in the regularity of the substance of the human spirit; or in its prejudices; or in its limitations; or in its restless movement; or in the influence of the emotions; or in the limited powers of the senses; or in the mode of impression” (LII)
The idols of the cave are those of an individual. They have their origin in “the individual nature of each man's mind and body; and also in his education, way of life and chance events.” (LIII)
The idols of the marketplace are those of miscommunication and misunderstanding. As Bacon says “For men believe that their reason controls words. But it is also true that words retort and turn their force back upon the understanding; and this has rendered philosophy and the science sophistic and unproductive.” (LIX)
The idols of the theater are those of intellectual 'showmanship.' They are “not innate or stealthily slipped into the understanding; they are openly introduced and accepted on the basis of fairytale theories and mistaken rules of proof.” (LXI)
All quotes from Bacon &amp; Jardin (2000).  Roman numerals indicate Aphorism number.
Bacon lists 27 different types of these 'privileged instances' in Book 2 of his Novum Organon.
If you aren't familiar with the argument, you can read it, in Latin English and French, here: http://www.wright.edu/cola/descartes/
There are many instances of this claim in the history of psychology: see, e.g. Wundt, 1876 (p. 175)
I can illustrate some of the differences in theoretical approach here with the example of color perception: Helmholtz posited that there were three basic primary colors: red, green and purple.  Ladd-Franklin argued that purple perceptually appeared to be (i.e. ‘looked like’) a mixture of red and blue, whereas yellow appeared to be primary. Thus, she theorized, there are in fact four psychologically primary colors: red, green, blue and yellow.  Helmholtz responded (quoted in Hering) that one could not draw conclusions about facts of physiology from direct psychological experience (i.e. introspection), therefore Ladd-Franklin’s observation had no bearing on the science of psychology.  While Ladd-Franklin’s point seems obvious and definitive against Helmholtz’s theory, it was widely rejected, on the basis of the unreliability of introspective reports and observations, in favor of the physiological reductionism of Helmholtz. In fact, it wasn’t until a plausible mathematical model based on Ladd-Franklin’s observation was proposed by Jameson and Hurvich in 1957 that the psychological community rejected Helmholtz’s theory in favor of Ladd-Franklin’s.
Experienced Reactors may recognize Helmholtz’ name from the Darwin Game.
I am skipping, for the sake of space, the fascinating history of British psychology during this period, as it adapted associationism to the new physiology. See Daston, L.J. (1978). “British Response to Psycho-Physiology 1860-1900.” The History of Science Society 69 (2) p. 192-208
And the ‘German Mind’ apparently: “The thoroughness of the German mind, its desire for perfection in every detail, and its philosophical aptitudes are well illustrated by the controversies now in vogue in the land of universities.”(http://webapps.jhu.edu/jhuniverse/information_about_hopkins/about_jhu/daniel_coit_gilman/)
See Ch. V of Miller (1962)
(Miller, 1962, p. 66) argues that “If Watson had not been so inept as a philosopher, he might have offered behaviorism as a pragmatic theory of mind, comparable to Peirce’s pragmatic theory of meaning, James’ pragmatic theory of truth, and Dewey’s pragmatic theory of value.”
In the interests of conciseness, I am skipping over the fascinating and under-rated history of Gestalt psychology. I do this with a heavy heart, as it is one of my favorite topics in the history of psychology. Characters who wish to engage with the tradition of behaviorism, however, should pay careful attention to Wolfgang Köhler's presidential address, included in the appendix, for the Gestalt concerns about this period in American Psychology.
This is only one of Hull's four criteria. The other are: (1) The definitions and postulates of a scientific system should be stated in a clear and unambiguous manner, they should be consistent with one another, and they should be of such a nature that they permit rigorous deductions. (2) The labor of deducing the potential implications of the postulates of a system should be performed with meticulous care and exhibited, preferably step by step and in full detail. It is these deductions which constitute the substance of a system. (4) The theorems so deduced which concern phenomena not already known must be submitted to carefully controlled experiments. The outcome of these critical experiments, as well as all previous ones, must agree with the corresponding theorems making up the system.
See the section on behaviorism in the 'Public Character info' section for more on the difference between operant and classical conditioning.
“Gradually it was found that all the equations could be written down without bringing in forces. What was observable was a certain relation between acceleration and configuration; to say that this relation was drought about by the intermediacy of 'force' was to add nothing to our knowledge. Observation shows that planets have at all times an acceleration towards the sun, which varies inversely as the square of their distance from it.  To say that this is due to the 'force' of gravitation is merely verbal, like saying that opium makes people sleep because it has a dormitive virtue. The modern physicist, therefore, merely states formulae which determine accelerations, and avoids the word 'force' altogether. 'Force' was the faint ghost of the vitalist view as to the causes of motions, and gradually the ghost has been exorcized.” (Russell, 1946, p 495)

#### Brief History of the Study of Homosexuality in America

While homosexual behavior has appeared throughout human history, the notion of homosexuality as an “orientation” or “personality” is relatively recent.  The etymology of the word 'homosexual' itself shows the intimate connection between the idea of sexual orientation and the history of psychiatry.  According to the OED, the term first appears in print in English in C. G. Chaddock translation of R. von Krafft-Ebing 1892 *Psychopathia Sexualis*. Relevant sections are reproduced in Appendix &lt;!--\ref{app: KraftEbbing1}--&gt;.

The idea of homosexuality as a lifestyle is, in the English speaking world at least, indelibly linked to the public persona of Oscar Wilde. Wilde was a flamboyant public figure, known for dressing immaculately and flamboyantly, his sharp wit and his talent at dinner conversation.  While he was studying classics at Oxford, he began advocating aestheticism, the view that aesthetic values trump moral or social values in the understanding of art and literature. In 1895, he and his companion Alfred Taylor were convicted of acts of 'gross indecency' and sentenced to two years hard labor.

Their trial was 'the trial of the century' in the English upper-class, and to this day, many of Wilde's personal characteristics inform the common stereotypes of homosexual men. For example:   fastidiousness with respect to personal appearance, extraordinary wittiness and social adeptness, esp. with upper-class women, are all traceable to Wilde himself.

The next fifty years were not kind to gay folks.  “Treatments” for homosexuals included surgical interventions such as castration, vasectomies, lobotomies, sterilization, clitoridectomies, hysterectomies; chemical interventions such as sexual stimulants, depressants, hormonal injections, and pharmacological shock; psychological interventions included adjustment therapy, psychoanalysis, hypnosis, aversion therapy that included electric shock and desensitization; and social psychological interventions patterned on Alcoholics Anonymous like 'Homosexuals Anonymous' and others.

One of the saddest stories of this era is that of Alan Turing, who was mentioned in the section above on &lt;!--\ref{concurrentdevelopments:logicandcomputing} on page \pageref{concurrentdevelopments:logicandcomputing}--&gt;. Turing was one of the greatest mathematicians and logicians of his era, if not the greatest. During WWII, he worked at Bletchley park as one of Churchill's famed code-breakers. His efforts in breaking the German codes lead directly to the development of modern logic and the invention of the electronic computer. He is generally considered to be the founder of both modern cryptography and computer science.  Quite literally, Turing is to the contemporary information age what Newton was to the age of mechanics, or Einstein the nuclear age.

But Turing was also gay. In 1952, he was prosecuted and convicted for being a homosexual. Sentenced to hormone therapy and stripped of his military clearance, he committed suicide on June 7th, 1954. In 2009, the British Government started a program of accepting online petitions from citizens of the UK. One of the first to be submitted, and promoted by Richard Dawkins, was a call for an official apology to Alan Turing for unjust prosecution. On 10 September 2009, Prime Minister Gordon Brown issued a formal apology to Alan Turing, stating:

&gt; It is thanks to men and women who were totally committed to fighting fascism, people like Alan Turing, that the horrors of the Holocaust and of total war are part of Europe’s history and not Europe’s present. So on behalf of the British government, and all those who live freely thanks to Alan’s work I am very proud to say: we’re sorry, you deserved so much better.


During this period, advocates for homosexuals (at this time called 'homophile' organizations) focused primarily on changing the stereotypes of the homosexual as a step towards ending  the criminalization of homosexual acts as well as the psychological and medical 'treatments.'  There was little activity within the scientific and academic communities on the issue. That all started to change when a young social psychologist naed Evelyn Hooker started teaching at UCLA.

During WWII, young men and women who were accused of homosexuality in Pacific theater of operations for the US Military tended to be discharged in California ports, including San Diego, Long Beach and San Francisco. Many, if not most, of these young people could not return to their hometowns because of their dishonorable discharge from the military. As a result, a organic community of homosexuals began taking shape in many of these cities.

Hooker became friends with one of her graduate students, Sam Fromm. Sam was gay. In 1943, he challenged her to study 'people like him' to determine if they were mentally ill (specifically 'neurotic') independently of the biases against homosexuality inherent in the psychiatric tradition. In a 1998 interview, Hooker explained the significance of this phrase:

 &gt; “This bright young man, somewhere in his early thirties, had obviously been thinking about this for a long time. And by ‘people like us’ he meant, ‘We’re homosexual, but we don’t need psychiatrists. We don’t need psychologists. We’re not insane. We’re not any of those things they say we are.” (Eric Marcus, Windy City Times, October 31, 2007 • vol 23 no 07)

During the 1940's, Evelyn Hooker became a trusted 'outsider' of the gay community in L.A., but didn't want to conduct research on people she saw as her friends.

##### The Kinsey Report

In 1948, Alfred C. Kinsey (b. 1894 – d. August 25, 1956) published Sexual Behavior in the Human Male. It was revolutionary.

Kinsey and his assistants had interviewed  5300 white males from all walks of American life. The interviews required up to 521 questions, depending on the interviewees experiences, with the average being around 300.  Kinsey reported that a large number of men—up to 45%—reported having at least one homosexual encounter during his adolescence.  These encounters are most frequent at young age, dropping to a stable 10% of the population by age 20-25. These numbers, Kinsey fears, may not tell the whole story because:

&gt;The social significance of the homosexual is considerably emphasized by the fact that both Jewish and Christian churches have considered this aspect of human sexuality to be abnormal and immoral. … Social custom and our Anglo-American law are sometimes very severe in penalizing one who is discovered to have had homosexual relations. In consequence, many persons who have had such experiences are psychically disturbed, and not a few of them have been in open conflict with the social organization. (p. 610)

The Kinsey report found that homosexual activity as a common part of male sexual development.  Self-identifying as a homosexual, or engaging exclusively in homosexual activity, was found to be more rare. But at 10%, almost twice as high as any previous scientific estimate. Almost as importantly, he identified the source of psychic disturbance not to be the homosexual activity itself, but the social structures that penalize such behavior.

--&gt;

Two years after the publication of the Kinsey report, a group of 'homophile' activists founded the Mattachine society, which is now generally recognized as the first national gay-rights organization.

 The Mattachine society, named for a European tradition of theater masks, sought to change the prevailing view of homosexuality by presenting the membership as no different than the mainstream heterosexual society. Its members dressed in suits and skirts, and showed no 'outward signs' of homosexuality. These 'outward signs' are, of course, those stereotypes we identified earlier as originating with Oscar Wilde. Mattachine society demonstrations—held annually in front of Independence Hall in Philadelphia on July 4th—were sober affairs of men in gray suits and women in dresses walking up and down in straight lines, conspicuously *not* holding hands or being affectionate to one another. See the "Rules for Picketting" published by the Mattachine Society in Figure &lt;!--\ref{fig: MattachineRules}--&gt;



The Daughters of Bilitis were a secret social club for Lesbians founded in San Francisco in the 1950s by Del Martin and Phyllis Lyon. To stay in touch with its members, it created a magazine called 'The Ladder', which came under the editorship of Barbara Gittings in 1963. It flourished under Gittings' direction, growing from a simple hand-stapled newsletter to a true 40-page magazine.

##### Connecting the dots: Evelyn Hooker

After the publication of the Kinsey report, Hooker finally decided to meet Fromm's challenge. She designed an experiment to determine if homosexuals were mentally disturbed.  In 1954, she received a grant from the National Institute on Mental Health to run her study. She recruited 30 homosexuals the Mattachine society as well as the gay community generally. An equal number of heterosexual men were recruited from civil organizations around the L.A.. Individuals in the groups were matched with respect to age, IQ and education level. All people currently in therapy for mental health were excluded from the study.  This alone was a major step forward in the study of male homosexuality, as all previous psychological studies had found their subjects in psychiatric wards, army barracks or clinical settings.

Hooker tested the resulting 60 men using standard psychological tests: the Rorschach, Thematic Apperception Test (TAT) and the Make-A-Picture-Story Test (MAPS). The data was blinded and mixed, and then sent to psychologists with expertise on these the tests who were instructed to score them normally and return the scores.  Hooker found no significant difference between the 30 homosexual and 30 heterosexual males with respect to standard tests for mental disturbances, indicating that homosexual men were no more likely to be neurotic than equivalent heterosexual men.

Hooker presented her findings at the 1956 APA in Chicago. Her paper was published in 1957, shortly after Sam Fromm's death in a car accident.

##### Stonewall: The street activists


By the 1960s, tensions were growing in the gay community. Another group of younger gay activists were growing irritated with both the slow progress of the Mattachine society and its restrictions on behavior. In 1968, a group of young 'street-activists' disrupted a meeting of the American Medical Association in New York by shouting down Charles Socarides, a Psychiatrist known for his psychoanalytic treatment of homosexuals.

Everything changed forever on Saturday, June 28, 1969 at 1:20 AM, when the police raided the Stonewall Inn in Greenwich Village. The gay and lesbian patrons of the Stonewall resisted arrest. Events escalated. The riots that followed lasted until Wednesday night, July 3rd.

--&gt;

On the Fourth, the gay community’s attention turned to Independence Hall in Philadelphia and the Mattachine society’s annual march. As usual, Frank Kameny and Barbara Gittings, long time leaders of that gay and lesbian advocacy group, required the women to wear skirts and men suits. When couples held hands, Kameny famously scolded “None of that!” But the tide had turned. The young protestors from Stonewall would not conform. Kameny’s approach of assimilation  to “straight” behavior had been surpassed by the direct action begun at Stonewall. Militant groups such as the Gay Liberation Front and the Gay Activist Alliance sprouted up overnight (both started in New York). Plans were made to confront those who continued to classify homosexuality as a mental disorder, and directly challenge those who continued to treat homosexuals using barbaric methods.

And those plans included San Francisco, site of the 1970 American Psychiatric Association’s annual convention. And you already know what happened there.

            <Comments>In Victorian England, 'gross indecency' was defined as sexual acts between men that did not rise to the level of 'buggery'.
There is a superb website in the UK that is collecting stories of patients, doctors and nurses from this era. All are deeply disturbing, some downright terrifying.  See http://treatmenthomosexuality.co.uk/.  I'll quote just one example here, as it so perfectly illustrates classical conditioning:
“We need to remember that the discussions that went on at Maudsley in the early 50s were constantly searching for ways in which we could understand the relationship between events, so again referring to the ideas put forward by Pavlov, Skinner and Wolpe, if a situation produces anxiety and at the same time there is another even occurring then buy the process of conditioning it's quite likely that the reaction of  anxiety will become associated with the unconditioned stimulus. By thinking along those lines it seemed to me that if the process of sexual arousal and gratification is linked with something, it may well become the preferred method of seeking gratification. It seemed to me that if a person wanted to stop being involved in and interested in make figures—so long as he had bisexual potential or interests—we might be able to utilize the other half of the spectrum of potential arousal signals. And, if we did that often enough, he then might be gratified by femininity.”

The often repeated statistic that 10% of any given population is gay or lesbian originates with Kinsey’s study.

The use of the word 'gay' as a replacement for 'homosexual' dates from precisely this time with precisely these people. The Mattachine society and the older organizations used 'homosexual' and 'homophile' to refer to themselves. Ironically, the use of ’Gay'  to mean ‘homosexual’ is no attributed to Frank Kameny himself, who started a “Gay is good” campaign in 1968, to parallel the “Black is beautiful” campaign.</Comments>

Structuralism

Bloomfield structuralism in American, originated with Saussuer's 'Course in General Linguistics' from 1916.  Bloomfield was sympathetic to Watson's behaviorism. Structuralism in Europe became identified with sympathetic movements in Anthropology (), Psychoanalysis and Marxism, but is largely known through the critiques by the 'Post-Structuralists' who rejected that movement.

Bloomfieldian structuralism was different.

Chomsky 1957:
3.1: argues for 'levels of representation' as necessary for adequate explanation. This is a theme throughout cognitive science, articulated most clearly in the work of David Marr.

2.1	Explicit analogy to mathematical, formal languages, and the rejection of the Markov machine as adequate.  This argument is simple and easy enough to repeat.
 Big point: pg 32. Linguistic processing requires 'phrasing' – which is analogous to Millers' 'chunking' in memory, and potentially analogous to the Gestalt's categorization.

#### History of classifications of mental illness
What makes a certain condition a ‘mental’ condition or a 'medical' or ’neurological’ condition?  Suppose you are a family doctor, and a patient presents with an unwelcome and unwanted problem--a twitch, perhaps. Do you call a psychiatrist or a neurologist? How do you know?

While behaviors associated with mental illness—hallucinations, catatonic states, mania, etc.—have been known since ancient times, psychiatry dates its regularization as a scientific discipline to the work of the French physician Phillipe Pinel. His *Traité médico-philosophique sur l'aliénation mentale; ou la manie* stands as the first attempt at a scientific classification of mental illness. The book, translated as *Treatise on Insanity* in 1806 by D.D. Davis, is excerpted in Appendix &lt;!--\ref{app: Pinel}--&gt; on page &lt;!--\pageref{app: Pinel}--&gt;.  

Pinel was an intellectual disciple of Étienne Bonnot de Condillac, who in turn, was a disciple of John Locke. Locke is most well known as the intellectual progenitor of the American Constitution. But his views on the nature of mind and the empirical basis of knowledge held sway over much of the Western intellectual world in the first half of the 19th century.   Locke's influence on Condillac and hence Pinel was two-fold: first, he held that all our ideas originate in sensation and reflection. Second, and as importantly, Locke followed Francis Bacon in teaching that all knowledge must be based on careful, systematic observation.

For the empiricists, it follows that insanity, which is a severe form of our ideas 'leading us astray', is explained by a incorrect connection and association of ideas. The mechanism is simple: some of our ideas have a natural affinity or connection with one another. Others are held together by mere custom or habit. Cases of insanity are cases where habitual associations become so disorganized they begin to effect the 'natural' associations. This misassociation can become so extreme that it can “set us awry in our actions, as well moral as natural, passions, reasonings, and notions themselves” (Locke, Bk 2, Ch 33, p9. p 317). It is worth noting that to this day, we use metaphors like 'lost his senses' to describe someone with mental illness; and we describe poorly chosen actions as 'not very sensible.'

This is simply the theoretical basis for understanding insanity in the broadest possible terms.  To truly understand how mental disorder is defined and classified, we must consider how the mentally ill have been treated.

##### Foundations
###### Foundation in Empiricism: Phillipe Pinel

Phillipe Pinel (1745-1826) revolutionized the treatment of the insane. When, in 1792, he was appointed a physician at the main asylum in Paris—the Bicêtre hospital—the situation was dire. According to a biographer in 1846:

&gt; The buildings were unfit for habitation. In them were congregated men crouching together in the mud, in stone cells, narrow, cold, damp, destitute of air and light, and merely furnished with a straw bed, seldom renewed, and soon becoming foul and offensive; wretched dens, in which one would hesitate to place the meanest animal. The insane, who were immured in these filthy holes, were at the mercy of their attendants, and these persons were malefactors released from prison. The wretched patients were loaded with chains and manacled like convicts. Thus given up defenseless to the wickedness of their guardians, they were the sports of an insulting mockery, or of a brutality all the more blind that it was gratuitous. (Marx, 1846, p. 194-195)

Upon his arrival, Pinel immediately began advocating pity, respect, and compassion for the patients, not only for humanitarian reasons, but also in order to allow the Baconian method of careful observation. In short, given the terrible conditions at the Bicêtre, one would never be able to determine if the behavior of the patients was the result of some underlying conditions, or the condition of the Hospital itself. Bicêtre's chief physician, Pussin, was sympathetic to Pinel's techniques, and began a pilot study of unchaining the patients.


Two years later, Pinel was appointed  chief physician of the Hospice de la Salpêtrière—Paris' parallel institution for women. There, the women were kept chained, often naked, in subterranean cells; subjected to the terrors of abusive guards and hungry rats. Pinel immediate banned the use of metal chains as restraints, allowed the women clothing, and established something resembling human civility. This act was mythologized during the French Revolution as part of the overthrow of the aristocratic order, and has been duly commemorated in Art.

Pinel's revolutionary kindness is not just a story of a sympathetic humanitarian.  Pinel's goal was to  systematical classify mental illness in the Baconian manner.  The conditions of confinement found in the Bicêtre and the Salpêtrière compounded the patients' mental illness, and confounded his attempts at observation. In these conditions, one could not determine if the regularity of symptoms found in the population resulted from the illness or the treatment. By providing the patients respect and dignity, he believed he could observe their mental illness in a more untainted form.

In general, Pinel followed Locke and Condillac in holding that insanity was 'derangement of the understanding’, yet extended the view to cover cases where memory, understanding and judgment were perfectly sound, and still the patient was maniacal. Pinel thus abandoned any formal all-encompassing theoretical explanation of insanity per se, and preferred to work with its variants, which he classified as mania, melancholy, dementia and idiocy.

Pinel spent a great amount of time showing that the conditions he was treating did not have a physiological basis. Much of his argumentation in Treatise on Insanity turns on the dissections performed on patients who had died while at the Bicêtre. The reason for this was two-fold: first, the ancient Aristotlean understanding of the mind held that mental illness resulted from too much or too little of one of the four main 'humours': black bile, yellow bile, blood and phlegm.  By showing that the mentally ill had no significant lesions in the brain, or imbalances in their 'fluids', Pinel was able to establish the independence of psychiatry from other forms of medicine.

Secondly, there is a long tradition of defining the 'mental' as that which is opposed to the 'physical'. For example, Rene Descartes famously argues that the actions of our bodies can be explained entirely in physical, mechanistic terms, except that which can be attributed to, in his terms, our 'souls.'  It follows then, that if an illness is to be truly mental, it must not have a physical explanation. And most importantly, physical causes are treated with physical interventions. As insanity was now deemed non-physical, the treatment cannot be physical. Hence, psychiatry is a discipline independent from physical medicine.

While Pinel had no strong theoretical commitment or agenda, by following Locke's notion of mental illness as a confusion of ideas, he made two significant contributions to both psychiatry as a medical discipline and our understanding of the mind more broadly: First, if insanity was just a misassociation of ideas, it was not a permanent, inherited incurable disease. Second, if insanity is a misassociation of ideas, it does not depend on or result from physiological changes. Explanations for mental illness thus did not require autopsy; and treatment did not require surgery. Psychiatry was, as a result, independent of medicine.

It is likewise important to recognize that Pinel was, in many ways, precisely following Bacon's system of investigation. He was not attempting to form an overarching explanation. He was setting down tables upon tables of observed facts, classifying and arranging phenomena, highlighting privileged instances, and was open to any and all techniques that might shed light on these cases. After initial observation, he split “insanity” into four varieties, distinguishing between the incurable dementia and idiocy from the often transient and curable mania and melancholy.

Therapeutically, Pinel called his humane treatment of the insane the 'moral treatment.' In his words,

&gt;I then discovered, that insanity was curable in many instances, by mildness of treatment and attention to the state of the mind exclusively, and when coercion was indispensable, that it might be very effectually applied without corporal indignity. (p. 108).

His therapeutic program meant paying attention to the environment in which the insane were confined. He changed the architecture, the diet, the way the nurses and orderlies treated the patients, everything.  He even went so far as to allow the higher-functioning patients to work as nurses for the lower-functioning. Patients were listened to. Careful, detailed personal histories were taken. Baths, walking and gardening were encouraged.

A lack of theoretical commitment meant that Pinel could borrow techniques from the many snake-oil salesmen and charlatans who populated Western Europe at the time.  One of these happened to be mesmerism, now known as hypnosis. As a follower of Bacon, Pinel was only interested tabulating observations of results, and comparing them against the observations of the condition without intervention.  He insisted that we cannot cure a disease until we know of the progression of the disease *without* intervention.  In his own words, “We cannot cure diseases by the resources of art, if not previously acquainted with their terminations, when left to the unassisted efforts of nature.” (p. 109). For him, extreme treatments could only be used in extreme cases. The curable would be cured by simple humane treatment.

It is worth pointing out that the word 'asylum' means, of course, a sanctuary or refuge. It *first* appears in English in the 1808 translation of Pinel's Treatise on Insanity, to reference the Bicêtre! It appears in English newspapers starting in the 1860's, to describe leper colonies---long after Pinel's 'moral treatment' had come to dominate the English treatment of the mentally ill.

###### Mental Alienation - Esquirol

While Pinel tended to think of transient mental illness as a confusion of ideas, he occasionally spoke of the role of passions in mental illness.  In the early pages of the Treatise, he hypotheses three different causes of insanity:

&gt;I now proceed to describe the general progress of periodical insanity. Among its various causes; exclusive of changes in the state of the atmosphere, my experience leads me to enumerate as the most frequent; undue indulgence of the angry passions; any circumstances calculated to suggest the recollection of the original exciting cause of the disease, intemperance in drinking, inanition, &amp;c. (p. 12)

Pinel's greatest student, Esquirol built on this hypothesis of 'undue indulgence of the angry passions' and redefined the notion of transient insanity as 'mental alienation.' It was Esquirol who grew the empirical understanding of the mind into a full-fledged psychiatric system. But like Pinel, the set of conditions he sought to explain were those with symptoms that were not obviously explained by physical, bodily conditions.

To Pinel's four-fold classification, Esquirol added monomania, or obsession with a single idea, as distinct kind of mental illness.  'Melancholy,' he renamed 'lypemania.' because the former implied the medieval theory of 'humors' and  'black bile.' 

Monomania, lypemania and mania were distinguished by the nature of the passions that are out of order: “The passions of the insane are impetuous, especially in mania and monomania. They are of a depressing character in lypemania. In dementia and imbecility, those only exist, which spring from the first wants of man,--love, anger, jealousy.” (p 26).  

As the curable, transient forms of insanity were diseases of malformed passions, their treatment required reforming or redirecting the passions. His five varieties of insanity are defined thus:

	1.	Lypemania (melancholy of the ancients) delirium wih respect to one, or a small number of objects, with predominance of a sorrowful and depressing passion.
	2.	Monomania, in which the delirium is  limited to one or a small number of objects, with excitement, and predominance of a gay, and expansive passion.
	3.	Mania, in which the delirium extends to all kids of objects, and is accompanied by excitement.
	4.	Dementia, win which the insensate utter folly, because the organs of thought have lost their energy, and the strength requisite to fulfill their functions.
	5.	Imbecility, or idiocy, in which the conformation of the organs has never been such, that hose who are thus afflicted, could reason justly. (29)]

It is important to note here that the passions accompany delirium with respect to collections of objects.  One cannot be passionate without being passionate about something. The 'something' that is the object of passion is supplied by the senses – and hence, we're still within a Lockean framework of understanding the mind.  

According to the Lockean framework, all ideas originate in sense experience or internal reflection. When the passions directed at one of these ideas becomes excessive and out of control, lypemania or monomania results, depending on the nature of the particular passion that becomes excessive. When the passions are exaggerated without a specific object, and hence apply themselves to every object, or what ever object is before the senses at a particular moment, mania results.

Mental illness's causes “are as numerous as its forms are varied.”  Case studies presented in his Mental Maladies include climate, seasons, age, sex, temperament, trauma (especially during the first menstrual cycle for young women), excessive study, ambition, etc. Again, as in Pinel, the difference between the mentally ill and the mentally stable is one of scale, not of kind.  Everyone has passions – they are why we grieve, fall in love, work for that 'A', make personal sacrifices for our friends and families, etc. – the question of insanity is whether these passions are appropriate or excessive and whether they are directed at an appropriate or inappropriate object.

According to Esquirol:

&gt;“The first wants of man, limiting themselves to those connected with his preservation and reproduction, provoke the determinations of instinct; an internal impulse leads us to gratify them.

&gt;The secondary wants, attach themselves to the first, and the desires which they excite, acquire as much more energy, as we have means of satisfying them, They produce the primitive passions; in fine, they are the wants which are connected with our preservation; and are the fruit of our increasing intelligence and civilization. They engender the factitious passions,—those passions which cause the greatest injury to man, especially in the higher walks of life.

&gt;Infancy, except from the influence of the passions, is almost a stranger to insanity; but at the epoch of puberty, the sentiments, unknown until this period, cause new wants to arise. Insanity then appears, to trouble the first moments of the moral existence of man.
At mature age, the relations become extended, social wants multiple and the passions take a new character. In proportion as the amorous passions become enfeebled, those of a factitious nature grow strong. Personal interest, ambition, love of distinction and avarice, replace the charms of love and delights of paternity.

&gt;At this period of life also, mental alienation appears; insanity is more obstinate, and more concentrated. It passes more readily into a chronic state; and is more dependent upon abdominal lesions.

&gt;A sense of his weakness, renders the old man more clam; and while meditating upon the errors to which the passions lead, he isolates himself, and becomes an egotist.

&gt;Insanity from a moral cause, rarely exists with him, and when he loses his reason, it is because his organs are fatigued and exhausted. Hence, it is neither mania nor monomania which is developed, at this period, but senile dementia.

&gt;Of all moral causes, those which most frequently produce insanity, are pride, fear, fright, ambition, reverses of fortune, and domestic trouble. This last should have been placed, relative to its great influence, at the head of the moral causes, if it be limited to a simple ideas; but by domesticate troubles, I express all the pains, all the griefs, all oppositions, misfortunes and dissensions that grow out of the family state.
(Mental Maladies: A Treatise on Insanity, p 45-46)

Esquirol began to gather around himself a 'circle' of students who are sometimes referred to as the 'mental alienists'. Two of the most famous of his students were Charles Lasègue, who is now credited with working out the first definition of hysteria and first documenting *anorexia nervosa*; and Étienne-Jean Georget who delineated four sub-types of 'monomania': theomania (religious obsession), ertomania (sexual obsession), demonomania (obsession with evil) and homocidal monomania.

Esquirol's concept of monomania sparked what is probably the first recorded wave of copy-cat psychosis.  In November 1825, a young single mother of two named Henriette Cornier, decapitated the 19 month-old child of her neighbors. She had prepared her room for the act, even placing a bucket to catch the blood. She had known the family of the infant for only ten days, and had, up until this event, been nothing but loving and gentle towards the little girl who would be her victim. When the police arrived, she offered no resistance to the police, and did not flee. She confessed, saying that the idea had taken hold of her, and she simply had to act upon it.

The case became a sensation across Europe. Georget diagnosed her as a 'homicidal monomaniac.' At her trial, the jury decided that the act had not been premediated and as a result, she was sentenced to life in prison with hard labor instead of death. This ruling makes little sense: Cornier admitted that the idea had occurred to her before the event, and she had carefully prepared her room for the murder. Thus, many commentators—include Lisa Appengasi (p 75)—have attributed the jury’s leniency to Georget's diagnosis of mental alienation. After all, if Cornier was mentally ill, does pre-planning count as 'premediation'?

The idea of the murderous monomaniac took off across Europe, informing or appearing in some of the greatest literature of era, including (according to various literary critics) Poe's “The Tell-Tale Heart,” the character of Roskolvikov in Dostovesky's Crime and Punishment, and even Heathcliff in Bonte's Wutherheights. The Marquis de Sade is also said to have been a monomaniac.

##### Early Neurology
######  American Nervousness --- George Beard

George Beard (1839-1883) was an American physician who started out advocating for the use of electricity as a medical intervention.  His first book *Electricity as a Tonic* (1866) suggested that electricity could be used to cure 'general nervous debility,' including dyspepsia, chorea, neuralgia, anaemia, or amenorrhoea. (1867, p. 73) Beard was a charismatic popular author, who went on to write a series of popular home-healthcare books starting with *Our Home Physician: Handy Book of Family Medicine* in 1869.

Starting in the 1870s, Beard became increasingly interested in psychological disorders. In 1881, he published *American Nervousness*, a book that came to define psychological treatment for a generation.  'Nervousness' did not mean then what it means today: jitteriness or tension. Then, it denoted a kind of fundamental exhaustion—what we still call a 'nervous breakdown'.  Technically, Beard defined it as:

&gt;“deficiency of lack of nerve-force. This condition, together with all the symptoms of diseases that are evolved from it, has developed mainly within the nineteenth century, and is especially frequent and severe in the Northern and Eastern portions of the United States. Nervousness, in the sense here used, is to be distinguished rigidly and systematically from simple excess of emotion and from organic disease.” (1881, p. vi)

It was caused by “modern civilization, which is distinguished from the ancient by these five characteristics: steam-power, the periodical press, the telegraph, the sciences, and the mental activity of women.” (p. vi)

Beard was building on both folk theory of innate energy as well as recent discoveries in neurology (compare, for example, the concurrent theory of 'specific sense energies' proposed by  Müller – see the &lt;!--\ref{birth-germanphysiologicalpsychologyinthe1880s-1890s} on page \pageref{birth-germanphysiologicalpsychologyinthe1880s-1890s}--&gt;.). But he extended his view to cover diseases such as “neurasthenia (nervous exhaustion... hysteria, hay-fever, sick-headache, inebriety... some and phases of insanity.” (p. vii) whose 'signs' could include:

&gt;The nervous diathesis; susceptibility to stimulants and narcotics and various drugs, and consequent necessity of temperance; increase of the nervous diseases inebriety and neurasthenia (nervous exhaustion), hay-fever neuralgia, nervous dyspepsia, asthenopia and allied diseases and symptoms; early and rapid decay of teeth; premature baldness; sensitiveness to cold and heat; increase of diseases not exclusively nervous, as diabetes and certain forms of Bright's disease of the kidneys and chronic catarrhs; unprecedented beauty of American women; frequency of trance and muscle-reading; the strain of dentition, puberty and change of life; American oratory, humor speech and language; change in type of disease during the past half century, and the great intensity of animal life on this continent. (p. vii-ix)

Beard died shortly after the publication of *American Nervousness*, but his cause was taken up by Silas Wier Mitchell (1829-1914), who popularized the standard treatment for American Nervousness: the rest cure. As you can probably imagine, if the cause of American Nervousness was modern civilization, including women having a mental life, the cure was removal from modern civilization, including banning women from having a mental life.

In 1885, at the age of 25, Charlotte Perkins Gilman, a member of a prominent family of American progressives that included the abolitionist author Harriet Beecher Stowe, the suffragist Isabella Beecher Hooker, and the charismatic clergyman Henry Ward Beecher, gave birth to her only child Katharine Beecher Stetson. After the birth, Charlotte Perkins-Gilman experienced what we now recognize as a severe case of post-partum depression.

She was taken to see Silas Wier Mitchell. She described her experience of the treatment she received thus:

&gt;“During about the third year of this trouble I went, in devout faith and some faint stir of hope, to a noted specialist in nervous diseases, the best known in the country.  This wise man put me to bed and applied the rest-cure, to which all still-good physique responded so promptly that he concluded there was nothing much the matter with me, and sent me home with solemn advice to 'live as domestic a life as far as possible,' to 'have but two hours' intellectual life a day' and 'never touch a pen, brush or pencil again' as long as I lived. This was in 1887.” (“Why I wrote The Yellow Wallpaper, 1913)

Her experiences you may know from the American Standard The Yellow Wallpaper (1892). Gilman acknowledged that she never suffered from the hallucinations the character did, but that she “came so near the borderline of mental ruin that I could see over.” (1913)

While Beard and Wier Mitchell are today often ridiculed as snake-oil salesmen playing on the political concerns over rapid modernization and the suffragist movement, they made a number of notable contributions to our commonsense understanding of psychological disorder. First, they indelibly linked mental disorders to neurology. As mentioned above, we still use phrases like 'nervous breakdown' in common parlance to explain psychological disorder. Second, by proscribing puberty, birth, menopause and the 'unprecedented beauty of American women' as prime causes of mental illness, they further established a link between the onset and frustration of sexuality with mental illness, a point Freud would build psychoanalysis.

It would be a mistake, however, to accept the simplistic narrative that the doctors of this era were manipulating and abusing their female patients without their consent. Historians of Psychology Laura C. Ball and Jennifer L. Bazar have recently demonstrated that in some cases, some women aggressive sought out procedures, such as clitorectomies, in this period. In one remarkable case, a patient even 'tormented the doctors to operate again.'

One way to chart the rise of psychiatric diagnosis is to consider how people with mental illness are counted.  Starting in 1830, the US census included categories for the disabled, including 'blind' and 'deaf.' From 1840-1870, the census included the category 'idiocy/insanity.' Starting in 1880, however, the federal government began using categories of mental illness. In 1880, those categories were:
&lt;!-- \begin{longtable}[!t]{ |  p{1cm} |  p{1cm} |p{4.8cm} | }

Readers of these sections will no doubt recognize this taxonomy as owing an intellectual debt to both Esquirol (Melancholy, Mania, Hysteria and Dementia) *and* Beard (Nerves).

###### Early Neurology --- Charcot

Charcot began his career at the Salpêtrière tending to the 'incurables'—the patients whose conditions had been classified as 'idiocy' or 'dementia.' Charcot saw himself primarily as a nosologist: a classifier or taxonomizer of disease, rather than a healer. His appointment was, in many ways, ideal. This was a patient population for which there was no hope of cure, and morever, had not been studied in a careful way.  

Charcot is, today, often classified as a neurologist. That is a bit of historicism, as there was no such field when he began work.  In fact, the 'neuron doctrine', or the idea that the nervous system is composed of individual cells called 'neurons,' is not formally advanced until 1891.  And it isn't until 1911 that Ramon y Cajal uses the Golgi stain to highlight neurons in the hippocampus, confirming the neuron doctrine.

None of that stopped Charcot from classifying a huge number conditions and diseases we still recognize today: multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS or “Lou Gerig's disease,” it was once called “Charcot's disease”), lenticulostriate artery (“Charcot's artery”), joint arthopathy (“Charcot's joint”), peroneal muscular atrophy (“Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease”), Charcot Wilbrand syndrome, Charcot's intermittent hepatic fever and even Parkinson's disease were first named or described by Charcot.

Methodologically, Charcot advocated what he called the 'anatomo-clinical' method, which meant careful anatomical analysis performed largely post-mortum combined with case studies of vivisection in both animals and human subjects. Once a behavioral deficiency has been identified, careful anatomical studies are carried out to determine any corresponding anatomical 'deficiency,' or lesion. In his own words:

&gt;Allow me to recall to your minds the opinion which that most illustrious physiologist, Claude Bernard, thus expressed:—“Pathology,” said he, “should not he subordinated to physiology. Quite the reverse. Set up first the medical problem which arises from the observation of a malady, and afterwards seek for a physiological explanation. To act otherwise would be to risk overlooking the patient, and distorting the malady.” These are excellent words, which I have ventured to quote verbatim, because they are absolutely significant. They enable us to clearly understand that the whole domain of pathology appertains strictly to the physician, who alone can cultivate it and make it fruitful, and that it necessarily remains closed to the physiologist who, systematically confined within the precincts of his laboratory, disdains the teaching of the hospital ward. (p. 8)


In 1878, he began extensive work on hypnosis. Charcot became increasingly interested in the therapeutic use of hypnosis to cure what he called 'hysteria', a vaguely-defined collection of usually transient symptoms that included paralysis, anesthesias, visual or auditory agnosias, temporary blindness or deafness, amnesia and seizures. While 'hysteria' came to be identified closely with women, Charcot himself believed that it could effect men, and treated many men that he diagnosed with hysteria.

This does not mean, however, that Charcot gave up his commitment to neurological explanations of behavior. He simply allowed functional and/or physiological explanations in addition to the anatomical. In his words:

&gt; There is another important fact in the history of neuroses in general, and of hysteria in particular, which clearly shows that these diseases do not form, in pathology, a class apart, governed by other physiological laws than the common ones. (13)

I've quoted this passage because it is the first use of the word 'neuroses' in print.  It's root in neurological terminology is obvious, but here Charcot uses it to demarcate transient, psychological, functional or dynamic neurological conditions from the incurable, intransient, anatomical neurological conditions. The former we classify as ‘mental’, the latter ‘neurological’---even today! 'Neurosis' thus supplants 'mental alienation' and 'nervousness' as the descriptor of the set of psychological conditions that cannot be explained physically.

In 1890, blocked by antisemitism in Germany from further education, a young Sigmund Freud came to study with M. Charcot. There, he learned the techniques of hypnosis. Later in life, Freud frequently referred to Charcot as his 'mentor,' and even attributed the idea that all neuroses originate 'in the genitals' to Charcot.

In his eulogy for Charcot, Sigmund Freud said:

&gt;He was not a reflective man, not a thinker: He had the nature of an artist—he was, as he himself said, a 'visuel', a man who sees... He used to look again and again at the things he did not understand, to deepen his impression of them day by day, till suddenly an understanding of them dawned on him.  In his mind's eye the apparent chaos presented by the continual repetition of the same symptoms then ave way to order: the new nosological picture emerged, characterized by the constant combination of certain groups of symptoms... He might be heard to say that the greatest satisfaction a man could have was to see something new-- that is, to recognize it as new; and he remarked against and again n the difficulty and value of this kind of 'seeing'. (Quoted in Mad, Bad and Sad, p. 128)

It should be fairly obvious that Freud here is dismissing, essentially, Charcot's Baconian approach to scientific classification. Careful, close observation with only careful, conservative theoretical suppositions. Unlike Charcot, who is remembered only in the names of the diseases he classified, Freud became globally famous for his theoretical suppositions. Whereas Charcot was content with describing neuroses and localizing them in the nervous system, Freud sought to explain the origins of neuroses in non-physical terms.

##### Rise of Psychoanalysis

###### Hysteria and Hypnosis: Freud &amp; Breuer on Anna O.

By the time the late 19th century arrives, we are beginning to find general agreement that mental illnesses are characterized by symptoms with no bodily, physical (or in Beard's terms 'organic') explanation. That understanding defined the limits of psychiatry. When a condition could be explained in anatomical terms, it was no longer considered psychiatric and reverted to medical. When it could not—when it had to be explained in terms of 'psychic energy—it was given to the psychiatrists.

This thesis was not challenged largely in part because psychiatrists practiced in hospitals that contained psychiatric patients. That sounds circular, but it isn't: Pinel, Esquirol and Charcot were attempting to create a theory of mental illness that could explain the patients they saw before them. The patients they saw before them were not brought there because they fit the theory, or because they had chosen to be there. They were brought to the Bicêtre and Salpêtrière when the rest of the medical community had given up attempting to explain their symptoms.

 The same can be said for Beard and Wier Mitchell: Perkins Gilman was taken to see Wier Mitchell only after all physical interventions had failed.

These founders of psychiatry theorized about a population that had been deemed mentally ill *because the medical community had given up explaining their symptoms*. Not the other way around. The Psychiatric hospital was a kind of catch-all for those individuals whose symptoms could not be alleviated by physical medicine, and hence it is unsurprising that the definitions of insanity we find in this era require the absence of a physical explanation.

In 1880, Josef Breuer, a student of the great psycho-physiologist Ewald Hering, was studying the ear as a part of his research at Vienna General Hospital. It was there that he first met 'Anna O.', a young woman with an extremely acute cough. Finding no physical reason for the cough, her family physician diagnosed her with “typical *tussis nurvosa* [nervous cough]” (p 27) 

 Shortly thereafter a number of other symptoms arose. Freud &amp; Breuer describe her case thusly:

&gt;  Before this time she too had always enjoyed good health, showing no sign of nervous indisposition during her development. Of considerable intelligence, remarkably acute powers of reasoning, and a clear-sighted intuitive sense, her powerful mind could have digested, needed even, more substantial intellectual nourishment, but failed to receive it once she had left school. Her rich poetic and imaginative gifts were controlled by a very sharp and critical common sense. The latter also made her quite closed to suggestion. Only arguments had any influence on her, assertions were without effect. Her will was energetic, tenacious and persistent, sometimes heightened to such obstinacy that it would give way only out of kindness and consideration for others.

&gt; One of her principle traits was a sympathetic kindness. Even during her illness, she benefited greatly from the care and support she gave to some sick and poor people, for it allowed her to satisfy a strong drive. Her spirits always tended slightly to exaggeration, whether of joyfulness or grief, and as a consequence she was also somewhat moody. The element of sexuality was remarkably undeveloped: the patient, whose life became transparent to me in a way that seldom happens between people, had never been in love, and not once in the mass of hallucinations that occurred during her illness did this element of the inner life emerge...

&gt;...The course of the illness falls into several distinct phases. They are as follows:

&gt; A)	Latent incubation. From mid-July 1880 to approximately 10 December. This  case was exceptional because it afforded so complete an insight into a phase that in most cases escapes us, and for this reason alone its pathological interest could not be overestimated. I will expound on this part of the history later.

&gt; B)	Manifest illness: a peculiar kind of psychosis, paraphasia, *stabismus convergens* [convergent squint], sever visual disturbance, paralyzing contractures, complete paralysis in the upper right and both lower extremities, partial paralysis in the upper left extremity, paresis of the neck muscles. A gradual reduction in the contracture of the right extremities. Some improvement, interrupted by a sever psychical trauma (death of the father) in April, after which

&gt; C)	A period of continual somnambulism ensues, which then alternates with more normal states; continuation of a series of chronic symptoms until December 1881.

&gt; D)	Gradual winding down of mental states and symptoms until June 1882. (p25-26)

Breuer took over her care during the period of 'manifest illness,'  during which, Anna O. slept for great periods of time ('somnambulism'), but when she awoke in the evening, she would complain of 'torment.' Her speech lost all grammatical structure ('paraphasia') and she would piece together words and phrases from the five distinct languages she spoke, producing an incomprehensible jargon. This same jargon appeared in writing, so Breuer knew that it was not a disfunction of the physical mechanism of speech.

In the early spring of 1881, Anna O fell mute for a period of two weeks. At this point, Breuer claims that he 

&gt;“knew she had taken great offense at something and had resolved to say nothing about it. When I guessed as much and forced her to talk about it, the inhibition, which had until then made it impossible for her to speak about anything else either, disappeared.” (p 29)

After her father's death, her illness became much more severe. Breuer noticed, however, that her periods of sleep in the later afternoon, during which she was 'tormented' by hallucinations, resembled hypnotic states.  He decided to preemptively hypnotize her and prompt her to 'talk through' these tormenting phantasies. The symptoms subsided quickly.  The day after a session, she would become 'quite calm' and 'agreeable, obedient, industrious and even in good spirits'. The second day after a session she would be 'increasingly moody, contrary and disagreeable, and this worsened on the third.'  Anna O. named these sessions (in English) the 'talking cure' and 'chimney-sweeping.'  Breuer preferred the more sophisticated 'cathartic procedure.'

Breuer communicated this to his friend Sigmund Freud, who offered to co-author a paper laying out his findings. That paper, titled 'The Psychic Mechanism of Hysterical Phenomena,' first appeared in 1893, but was republished as the first chapter of Freud and Breuer's Studies on Hysteria (1895). In it, Freud and Breuer propose a new form of hysteria, called 'traumatic hysteria', which they conjecture is always connected to some traumatic event that evokes the syndrome. They further hypothesize that the traumatic event can be unavailable to the conscious, reflective mind of patient—i.e. be unconscious—yet still be causally responsible for the hysterical symptoms.  Moreover, they hypothesize that making the patient aware of the trauma, via Beuer's 'cathartic procedure' using hypnosis if necessary, alleviates the hysteria.

###### Freud: The foundation of psychoanalysis

The seeds of psychoanalysis were planted by Charcot and Breuer, but they did not develop into a full-fledged system of Psychiatry until Freud worked independently. Building on his theory of unconscious trauma to explain hysteria, Freud hypothesizes that traumatic events may manifest themselves in the mind indirectly in the form of symbols. He then went on to realize that the fantasy lives of the psychotic are full of such symbols, and recovering the original trauma requires investigation of the mechanisms of symbolization.

It was this realization that gives us the basis for psychoanalysis, for it is this realization that allows Freud to argue that the hallucinations and fantasies experiences by the psychotic are not significantly different from the dreams of the sane. Whereas prior to Freud, dreams and hallucinations were thought to be without meaning, after Freud they were seen as full of symbolic representations, the meanings of which were available empirically through systematic investigation of the mechanisms of psychological representation. Freud's proposed mechanisms are introduced in the &lt;!--\ref{classical}--&gt; section on page &lt;!--\pageref{classical}--&gt; of the game book.

The barrier between the mentally ill and the mentally healthy had been permanently broken. No longer does the theory of psychiatry apply only to those who cannot be helped by medicine. Now the theory applies to everyone: a healthy person could become ill through unhealthy habits of mental representation, and ill people could become healthy through the process of discovering their habits of mental representation and recognizing their unconscious traumas.  

This conflation of psychiatric conditions and normal life left Freud in the precarious position of having to define 'mental illness.'  He did so thus:
&gt; Symptoms—and of course we are dealing now with psychical (or psychogenic) symptoms and psychical illness—are acts detrimental, or at least useless, to the subject's life as a whole, often complained by him as unwelcome and bringing unpleasure or suffering to him. (*Introductory Lectures*, p. 445)

####### Neurosis v. Psychosis

One of the hallmarks of Freud's theory is his thesis that the there is no hard and fast distinction to be made between the mentally ill and the mentally healthy. His *Introductory Lectures* are structured to introduce the reader to psychopathology in everyday life before extending the analysis of common activities to psychotics and neurotic patients.  As such, there are no hard and fast definitions of psychosis and neurosis.

During the course of normal development of mentally healthy adults, the ego must become 'reasonable': it must no longer let “itself be governed by the pleasure principle, but obeys the reality principle, which also at bottom seeks to obtain pleasure, but pleasure which is assured through taking account of reality, even though it is pleasure postponed and diminished.” (p. 444) A neurotic's ego fails to make this transition, and gets stuck at one point in development.  Thus, the neurotic's libido and ego are still struggling in a child-like way, but the contents of the struggle have been transformed into objects of adulthood. Neurotic symptoms are the “outcome of a conflict which arises over a new method of satisfying the libido” (p. 446) and a person is ill from neurosis only if “his ego has lost the capacity to allocate his libido in some way” (p. 480). A psychotic patient, however, has lost the battle for the reality principle, and the libido has created its own reality.

The object of a neurosis, then, is relevant to the diagnosis only insofar as it is a stand-in for the actual conflict by the mechanisms of repression, reaction formation, isolation, etc.  According to Freud: “clinical psychiatry takes little notice of the outward form or content of individual symptoms, but psychoanalysis takes matters up at precisely that point and has established in the first place the fact that symptoms have a sense and are related to the patient's experience.” (p. 318)

See Lectures 22 and 23 of the *Introductory Lectures* for a full discussion of neurosis and its origins.
###### The Clark Lectures

In 1909, G. Stanley Hall, first president of the American Psychological Association, invited Freud and Jung to give a series of lectures at Clark University. The conference itself was a major moment in the intellectual history of America, as such luminaries as William James, Franz Boas, Adolf Meyer and E.B. Tichner were in attendance, as well as the famed Anarchist Emma Goldman.

After the lectures, James Jackson Putnam, a neurologist in New York City, invited Freud and Jung to retire to his family's Adirondack 'great camp' for the weekend.  Putnam became an important advocate for psychoanalysis in the United States, establishing its legitimacy as a treatment for hysteria. While there are articles prior to 1909 on psychoanalysis (notably one by Putnam himself in 1906), we don't find significant discussion of  psychoanalysis in the mainstream journals of Psychology until after the Clark lectures. An effort to convince the American public of the scientific nature of psychoanalysis was mounted by Putnam camp attendees A.A. Brill, founder of the New York Psychoanalytic Society, and Ernest Jones, student of Freud. By 1916, Jones had published 20 articles, notes and reviews in the Journal of Abnormal Psychology offering or advocating for psychoanalysis.

Putnam and Freud went on to become close friends, and Putnam spent much of the rest of his career attempting to professionalize and regularize the practice of psychiatry. He founded the American Psychoanalytic Association (APsaA) in 1911, which is still active today. His posthumously published Addresses on Psychoanalysis, which contains a preface by Freud himself, not only seeks to introduce Freudian theory to his scientific community, but also to dispel misunderstanding gained “through the gossip of prejudice and misconception” (Putnam &amp; Jones, 1921, p. 3).

Putnam’s influence here cannot be understated. Putnam introduced psychoanalytic ideas to the budding field of medical neurology. His position as a medical doctor at Harvard gave psychoanalysis legitimacy as a medical practice in America, and his stature in the neurological community helped to assuage any doubts about the lack of a physical basis for the hypothetical entities posited by Freud's structural hypothesis.

The story is not all smooth sailing. In 1916, the Princeton philosopher and psychologist Warren Fite reviewed of Jung's Psychology of the Unconscious for The Nation, writing that it “presents some five hundred-odd pages of incoherence and obscenity in the form of a psycho-analytic interpretation of the experiences of a sentimental young American woman.” (Fite, 1916) The fact that the United States was at war with Germany didn't help the psychoanalytic cause: Christine Ladd-Franklin, a student of C.S. Peirce and protege of no less than Hermann Helmholtz as well as one of the first women in the APA, called Freud's theory the product of an “undeveloped... German mind.”

What followed is a history of tension between those in the psychological and psychoanalytic communities. Helped by the military's preference for psychoanalysts in the treatment of 'shell-shock' during WWI and 'combat fatigue' in WWII, psychoanalysis gained credibility in the eyes of the American public.

##### The DSMs

In 1917 during its annual meeting in New York, the American Medico-Psychological Association (now the American Psychiatric Association) in cooperation with the National Commission on Mental Hygiene formed a committee on statistics and charged it with creating a guide for classifying mental illness. The resulting document, Statistical Manual for the Use of Institutions for the Insane, was published in 1918 and adopted around the nation. It is available freely on google books. The manual outlined 21 medical-psychological categories:

In 1928, the New York Academy of Medicine invited the Public Health Service, the Army and Navy Medical Departments and the American Hospital Association to collaborate on a standard nomenclature of disease. That standard was first published in 1933 as A Standard Classified Nomenclature of Disease, generally referred to as The Standard, and was widely used until at least the 1960s. In its original form, it used the following ten categories:
	•	&lt;!-- \begin{longtable}[!t]{ | p{13.8cm}  | }
\hline
0 Diseases due to prenatal influences\\
1 Diseases due to lower plant and animal parasites\\
2 Diseases due to higher plant and animal parasites\\

5.5 Diseases due to disturbances of innervation or of psychic control\\
6 Diseases due to or consisting of static mechanical abnormality (obstruction; calculus; displacement and gross changes in form etc., due to unknown cause).\\
7 Diseases due to disorders of metabolism, growth or nutrition\\
8 New growths\\
9 Diseases due to unknown or uncertain causes, the structural reaction (generative, infiltrative, inflammatory, proliferate, sclerotic, or reparative) to which is manifest; and hereditary and familial diseases of this nature.\\

--&gt;

You'll notice that the medical classification is entirely based on the origin or cause of a condition ('Diseases due to...'), not the symptoms. In the &lt;!--\ref{1918Classification}--&gt;, classification system, mental diseases are classified by the Freudian terms 'psychosis' and 'neurosis', except for melancholy and dimentia.

During the WWII, psychiatrists classified patients according to the standards of the branch of the armed forces for which they worked. In 1943, Brigadier General William C. Menninger issued a bulletin called “Medical 203” that laid the foundations for medical classification of mental illness. The Navy, Army and Veterans affairs branches all used slightly different diagnostic criteria and classifications.

In 1949, the International Statistical Classification of Diseases (ICD) included, for the first time, a taxonomy of mental disorders. Its classification system was:

In the interest of unifying these different classification schema, the American Psychiatric Association voted to create the first Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM). The nomenclature committee adapted the Medical 203 bulletin into the DSM and circulated it to a randomly selected sample of the membership (10%). When it was overwhelmingly approved by those who replied, the APA adopted it as the standard for diagnosis in medical treatment of psychological disorders. It was published in 1952, and is available online at http://www.psychiatryonline.com/DSMPDF/dsm-i.pdf

The first DSM distinguished between “Disorders caused by or associated with impairment of brain tissue function,” “Mental Deficiency,”  “Disorders of psychogenic origin or without clearly defined physical cause or structural change in the brain” and “Nondiagnostic Terms for Hospital Record.”  This fourth category included “Alcoholic intoxication (simple drunkenness),” and “Dead on admission.”  It is the third category, those without a physical cause, that is of the most interest to us (the corresponding category of the ICD-6 is included in the right most column):

Notice that while the major classification here is 'Psychotic Disorders', the word "reaction" appears in 41 of the 48 diagnoses. See the overview of Classical Psychanalysis in section &lt;!--\ref{classical}--&gt; on page &lt;!--\pageref{classical}--&gt;.

The APA published the revised DSM-II in 1968. It's classification is included as an appendix.

##### The Rise of Psychopharmacology

Because psychoanalysis tended to be confined to clinical, military settings in the US, a kind of stable truce—the more cynical might even say a 'cold war’---settled over the conflict between behaviorism and psychoanalysis. By and large, psychoanalysis confined itself to the medical setting; while behaviorism confined itself to pure research. There were, no doubt, volleys across the bow of one or the other from time to time. But until Skinner's wide-ranging proposals for behaviorism as social reformation, there were few open hostilities.

Much of the scientific credibility for psychoanalysis turned on its success in treating psychotic patients.  Medical Doctors tend not to worry so much about the putative mechanism of a therapy, so long as that therapy works for the individual patient in question.  It isn't uncommon for a drug to help some small portion of the population and fail with another.  Generalizations to universal laws are uncommon in the practice of medicine, and much the of time the cause of a certain medical condition remains unknown, even if we understand how to cure it (consider cancers like lymphoma, for example). Thus, when psychologists objected that psychoanalysis did not generalize, its mechanisms were untestable, and as a treatment it was highly individualistic, medical practitioners were not overly impressed.  

All of that changed starting in 1955 when Wallace Labs began marketing the world's first popular psychotropic for the treatment of anxiety: *Miltown*. The Wallace Lab claimed that *Miltown* controlled anxiety without reducing mental function, allowing patients to return to their normal lives. It was quickly followed by *Trofranil*, an antidepressant, in 1959; *Librium*, an anti-anxiety medication, in 1960; and *Valium* in 1963. In 1969, the neurologist Oliver Sacks administered a new drug L-DOPA to patients who had been comatose for almost 40 years. They woke up.  His experiences were immortalized in the book and subsequent movie, *Awakenings.*

These drugs did—in short order—what years of psychoanalysis, hypnosis, electro-shock therapy (the decedent of Beard's treatments) and confinement could not: they allowed patients with crippling anxiety to return to normal or close-to-normal functioning.

#### Setting the stage for 1971

In 1961, Thomas Langer and Stanley Michael conducted 2-hour interviews with 1,660 individuals chose at random from the streets of New York. This was, in many ways, the first wide-scale study of the psychology of people *not already* seeking treatment for psychological trouble.  Their findings are quite simple: socio-economic status and age explain most of an individual's mental health. And that The study was revolutionary. As S. H. Kranes of the University of Chicago said "[this study] is a pioneer in obtaining 'objective' information.  Psychiatry is too promote to the philosophical other than the factual." (http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=1161943)

Since the origin of psychiatry, there has been a distinction made between those disorders that can be directly attributable to a biological dysfunction of the brain and those that cannot. The former were classified as 'neurological,' and the latter 'psychiatric.'  It is this inability to find a biological etiology of the disorder defines the domain of psychiatry.

Two major trends are appearing in psychology and psychiatry: 

1. The current psychoanalytic taxonomy of mental states is based on conjectures and assumptions based on a few case studies, and they have not been tested against evidence and observation.
2. Psychiatric disorders must have a physical component, and hence, the line between psychiatry and neurology may be breaking down.

In light of these trends,what will happen to the field of psychiatry?

The story of how Pinel became interested in insanity is frequently retold. Like Newton's apple, it is probably something of a myth, although there may be some core of truth. Here it is, as told by himself in A Treatise on Insanity:
	The loss of a friend, who became insane through excessive love of glory, in 1783, and the ineptitude of pharmaceutic preparations to the mind elated, as his was, with a high sense of its independence, enhanced my admiration of the judicous precepts of the ancients, and made me regret that I had it not then in my power to put them in practice. (p 52)
From a letter by Marx 1846:
	...in 1785, he had the misfortune to lose a young man to whom he was much attached, and whose reason became affected through excessive study and abstinence. This unfortunate person, after his return to his family, became maniacal, one evening he escaped from his father's house into the neighboring forest and was devoured by wolves; a few torn rags were found the following day, and near them a copy of the Phaedra covered with blood.
And by Lisa Appignanesi in 2009:
A shy provincial like himself, the friend had fallen into despair and then 'mania' when his legal aspirations failed to materialize. Unable to help the younger man once he had all but ceased to eat, Pinel had brought him to the Hôtel-Dieu where a treatment of baths and food seemed to restore him. But his worried family intervened and took him home before he was quite well. The youth escaped their hold, fled to the woods and was found dead only after the wolves had got him. (p58)
From a letter of honor, included in Marx 1846: “He who walks in an odoriferous flower-garden, which had formerly been a pestilential swamp, will best be able to appreciate what you effected in madhouses. Formerly an atmosphere almost stifling, damp rooms, the clank of chains, the cries of those under the lash, the hoarse growl of the rough attendants, the desperate frenzy of the ill-used patients; these succeeded by clean apartments, the greatest humanity in personal attentions, and an atmosphere of peace and confidence throughout the whole establishment. (p.210)
See Roberty Fleury's 'Dr. Phillippe Pinel at the Salpêtrière' (1795)
See, e.g p. 3, Section 4, p 134. Also, from the Marx (1846): Every delusion is the result of confused modes of thinking; wrong and crime originate in ignorance.” (p. 212)
Each humour had an associated personality type. Imbalance in a given humour was thought to be the cause of imbalances in mood or personality: people with too much black bile were melancholic, yellow bile choleric (full of energy), blood sanguine (impulsive), and phlegm phlegmatic (emotional). See Aristotle's Problems Bk 3, Section1 Galen's De temperamentis, and Avicenna's The Canon of Medicine for more detail.
The modern reader of A Treatise on Insanity is impressed by the number of times that Pinel stresses these two features of mental illness. We take both of these for granted to such an extent that the work can seem highly repetitive and redundant. But they were radical theses in the late 18th century, and Pinel's thoroughness in covering the topics no doubt reflects the importance of these thesis in his own mind. (Cite Data – number of pages, examples, etc.).
Where’s the list?

In his 'History of the Psychiatric Movement', Freud writes: “...It was the case of the young married couple from the far East. The wife was a great sufferer and the husband was impotent, or exceedinly awkward. I head Charcot repeat: “Tâchez donc, je vous assure vous y arriverez.” Brouardel, who spoke less distinctly, must have expressed his astonishment that such symptoms as those of the young wife should have appeared as a result of such circumstances, for Charcot said suddenly and with great vivacity: “Mais, dans de cas pareils, c'est toujours la chose génital, toujours—toujours-toujours.” And while saying that, he crossed his hands in his lap an jumped up and down several times, with the vivacity peculiar to him.” (Freud, 1938, p. 937-938)

We know that George Beard and Silas Wier Mitchell had the same view at this point, and that Freud was familiar with their work on ‘hysteria.’  What is unknown, given that Freud's retelling of this anecdote is based on his memory alone, is the accuracy of this story. It might be the case, and it might just be Freud misattributing a theory he picked up from Beard and Wier Mitchell to his mentor years after the fact.
See, for example, Drellich, Marvin G. “Classical Psychoanalytic School” in Arieti, S. (1974). American handbook of psychiatry (2d ed.). New York,: Basic Books.
I am simplifying here a bit. While Freud is commonly believed to originate the idea that dreams and psychotic hallucinations were best understood on a continuum, the ideas appears in the work of the British associationist Alexander Bain (see, e.g. Bain, A. (1903) Dissertations on Leading Philosophical Topics, Longmans, Green, and Co., New York and Bombay., p. 45)

The distinction between neurosis and psychosis has always been controversial. Consider Pavlov's comment in his 1927 lectures: “Contemporary medicine distinguishes "nervous" and "psychic" disturbances-neuroses and psychoses, but this distinction is, of course, only arbitrary. No real line of demarcation can be drawn between these two groups: it is impossible to imagine a deviation of higher activities from normal without a functional or structural disturbance of the cortex.” (Pavlov, 1927, Lecture 23)

### Frank Kameny Biography
You were born in Queens, New York to a middle class Jewish family. Your first academic interest was in science, and by the age of seven, you pledged your commitment in becoming an astronomer. You began your undergraduate degree in physics at Queens College, but you were interrupted by WWII, where you served as an Army Mortar crewman in Europe.  Your mother described you as excessively shy, but your time spent abroad during WWII brought you out of your shell. You returned from the war, finished your undergraduate degree, and went on to receive your PhD in physics from Harvard University in 1956 after being awarded a scholarship.
You have a dominating personality that is a cross between egotism and revolutionary. You have a habit of questioning the status quo and supporting your own conceptions. When you were a teenager, you proclaimed yourself an atheist to your parents. This attitude continued into your teaching fellow years at Harvard where you refused to sign a loyalty oath without attaching qualifiers, stating, “If society and I differ on something, I am willing to give the matter a second look…If we still differ, than I am right and society is wrong.”
Kameny was not so much concerned with changing society in so much as he refused to let society effect his own life. You avoided the exploration of your sexuality, and were therefore unsure of your orientation. You preferred spending your time in observatories. While finishing your dissertation in Arizona, you became friendly with a group of homosexuals and attended a gay bar, to which you stated, “I’ve come home”. You took full advantage of your sexual revelation, and spent the near future making up for lost time.
After receiving your doctorate, you worked as teaching assistant for the astronomy department at Georgetown University, before transferring to the Army Map Service in the heat of the Cold War. During this phase of life, you helped the army more accurately target their nuclear weapons by using points around the U.S to calculate the distance towards targets around the world. In 1957, Army security officials questioned your sexuality, to which you responded by asserting that your personal life was not the business of the federal government. You were immediately dismissed, leaving you jobless and dependent upon charity during the dawn of the space race; a time that should have been the greatest opportunity of your life.  The Federal government’s position was that homosexuality made a person unsuitable for federal employment. You had been dismissed just as hundreds had been before you, but you became the first to ever officially challenge this policy. Initially, legal efforts failed, and even your lawyer determined it best to abandon the case. You pressed on, outlining a case in which you argued that the discrimination you experienced was no less illegal and no less odious than discrimination based upon religious or racial grounds. After citing the Kinsey report, you presented reasonable grounds to believe that 15 million U.S citizens were gay and subject to the same persecution.
When the Supreme Court refused to hear the case once more, you moved to create a movement by founding the Mattachine Society of Washington, which was named after a group of medieval court jesters who were allowed to articulate unpopular truths under the secrecy of masks. The Mattachine Society of Washington was one of the first homosexual organizations to act under the mission of political activism, and focus its efforts on public awareness; its mission: “to act by any lawful means to secure for homosexuals the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness”.  Your influence stemmed heavily from surveying the black civil rights movement, and you eventually shifted homosexuality from a mental health issue to a civil liberties issue. You argued that your opposition was basing its arguments on emotion rather than reason, which prevented the pursuit of education and awareness. You claimed that homosexuals were more likely to have an employment issue than they were a mental health issue due to their sexual orientation.
You enacted a civil rights militancy strategy, taking to the streets, media, and the courts. Although your movement was legally focused, you understood that homosexuality’s classification as an illness was the main obstacle to overcome. You used your background in the sciences to demonstrate that the current view of homosexual psychology was based on psychiatric observations made on behalf of mental patients only, thus ignoring the millions of healthy gay Americans spread throughout the country. Your organization was the first that claimed homosexuality to be, “a preference, orientation, or propensity, on par with, and not different in kind from, heterosexuality”.  However, negative stigmas for homosexuality existed in propensity, thus counteracting the logic of your claims. You modeled a slogan after the African American movement’s, “Black is Beautiful”, thus coining the phrase, “Gay is Good”. America loves slogans, and the country’s “gut” began to shift into your corner. Today you are considered a pioneer in the homosexual civil rights movements, and cited as one of its most important figures.
When the Department of Defense launched an investigation into the sexuality of a young man named Benning Wentworth in 1969, you took the opportunity to testify. Charles Socarides was an expert witness for the prosecution. Your speech, “We Throw Down the Gauntlet” is not a classic in the gay rights movement. It is available here: http://www.kamenypapers.org/gauntlet.htm.
### Barbara Gittings Biography
You are a Librarian, activist and a pioneer of the American gay rights movement. You founded the New York chapter of the Daughters of Bilitis and edited its magazine, The Ladder. One of your life-long goals has been to get public libraries to provide more information on homosexuality to the public.
You were born on July 31, 1932 in Vienna, Austria. Your father, a career diplomat, was transferred back to the US in 1940, and your family settled in Delaware.
During your freshman year at Northwestern in 1949, you sought out therapy because you believed you might be a lesbian. The psychotherapist offered to cure you. Rather than submit to treatment, you went to the libraries to find information on homosexuality. The few resources you discovered were filed under 'perverted' or 'abnormal.' Moreover, the material on offer dealt almost exclusively with gay men.
As a result of the time you spent in the library researching homosexuality, you failed out of Northwestern. When you returned 'back east,' you moved to Philadelphia.
But you continued your research. In Philadelphia, you discovered a book titled The Homosexual in America (1951), written under the pseudonym 'Donald Webster Cory .'  You contacted the publisher and eventually contacted the author Edward Sagarin, who introduced you to the fledgling homophile movement, including the Mattachine Society.
When you went out to California to meet with the publishers of ONE, you met Phyllis Lyon and Del Martin, leaders of the lesbian organization Daughters of Bilitis. They asked you to found a chapter in New York, even though it meant a commute from Philly. You accepted.  
At a DOB meeting in 1961, you met another activist named Kay Lahusen. The two of you fell in love and soon became partners for life.
You succeeded Lyon and Martin as editor of DOB's magazine, The Ladder. During your three-year editorship, The Ladder began to publish articles critiquing medical authorities as well as the notion that homosexuals were sick.
In the early 1960's, your position in the DOB lead you to meet and collaborate with Frank Kameny.  Kameny's Washington DC chapter of the Mattachine Society was becoming more and more aggressive in its public advocacy, and you were encouraged. In 1965, you joined Kameny in a picket of  the White House. And the two of you organized annual demonstrations on July 4 at Independence Hall in Philly.
These tactics were not entirely welcome in the community at the time. You left the DOB because of these conflicts and joined Kameny's Mattachine society full time.
### Game Objectives
You are the leader of the Gay-PA. After the Stonewall protests of 1969, you've become committed to the idea that street-level protests and direct nonviolent confrontation ('Zaps') are the most effective mechanisms of social change.  You organized the San Francisco protests of 1970, and you have some ideas for 1971 and 1972.
The Gay-PA (in reality, the Chicago branch of the Gay Liberation Front) should issue something like following proclamation at the beginning of the conference in 1971 (distribute it as you see fit – i.e. post it to the door of the room, hand it out as players enter, etc.). It is vital that the draft is approved by the other members of the Gay-PA (Fryer, Hooker, Gold), and you should consult the secret 'young turks' (Marmor, Spiegel):
The establishment school of psychiatry is based on the premise that people who are hurting should solve their problems by “adjusting” to the situation. For the homosexual, this means becoming adept at straight-fronting, learning how to survive in a hostile world, how to settle for housing in the gay ghetto, how to be satisfied with a profession in which homosexuals are tolerated, and how to live with low self-esteem.
The adjustment school places the burden on each individual homosexual to learn to bear his torment. But the “problem” of homosexuality is never solved under this scheme; the anti-homosexualist attitude of society, which is the cause of the homosexual's trouble, goes unchallenged.  And there's always another paying patient on the psychiatrist's couch.
Dr. Socarides claims, “A human being is sick when he fails to function in his appropriate gender identity, which is appropriate to his anatomy.” Who determines “appropriateness”? The psychiatrist as moralist? Certainly there is no scientific basis for defining “appropriate” sexual behavior.... Other than invoking moral standards, Dr. Socarides claims that homosexuality is an emotional illness because of the guilt and anxieties in homosexual life.  Would he als consider Judaism an emotional illness because of the paranoia which Jews experienced in Nazi Germany?
We homosexuals of gay liberation believe that the adjustment school of therapy is not a valid approach to society.
We refuse to adjust to our oppression, and believe that the key to our mental health, and to the mental health of all oppressed peoples in a racist, sexist, capitalist society, is a radical change in the structure and accompanying attitudes of the entire social system.
Mental health for women does not mean therapy for women—it means the elimination of male supremacy. Not therapy for blacks, but an end to racism. The poor don't need psychiatrists (what a joke at 25 bucks a throw!)--they need democratic distribution of wealth. OFF THE COUCHES, INTO THE STREETS!
We see political organizing and collective action as the strategy for effecting this social change. We declare that we are healthy homosexuals in a sexist society, and that homosexuality is at least on part with heterosexuality as a way for people to relate to each (know any men that don't dominate women?).
Since the prevalent notion in society is that homosexuality is wrong, all those who recognize that this attitude is damaging to people, and that it must be corrected, have to raise their voices in opposition to antihomosexualism.  Not to do so is to permit the myth of homosexual pathology to continue and to comply in the homosexual's continued suffering from senseless stigmatization... We furthermore urge psychiatrists to refer to the homosexual patients to gay liberation (and other patients who are the victims of oppression to relevant liberation movements). Once relieved of patients whose guilt is not deserved but imposed, psychiatrists will be able to devote all their efforts to the rich—who do earn their guilt but not their wealth, and can best afford to pay psychiatrists'' fees.
We are convinced that a picket and a dance will do more for the vast majority of homosexuals that two years on the couch.  We call on the medical profession to repudiate the adjustment approach as a solution to homosexual oppression and instead to further homosexual liberation by working in a variety of political ways (re-educating the public, supporting pickets, attending rallies, promoting social events, etc.) to change the situation of homosexuals in this society.
Join us in the struggle for a world in which all humans are free to love without fear or shame.
(quoted in Rosario, 2002)

As a non-member of the APA, you cannot vote on the definition of mental illness. But be sure to advocate for one that does not penalize or marginalize those with harmless social differences.
#### Specific Assignments
Participate in the 1971 panel discussion with John Fryer and Evelyn Hooker. The texts of Kameny and Gitting's actual speeches are not recorded (to my knowledge), but Gittings' was probably titled “Gay, Proud and Healthy.”  Eyewitnesses record that Kameny was more confrontational and antagonistic to psychiatry while Gittings was more conciliatory. Kameny is quoted as arguing that “We're rejecting you all as our owners. We possess ourselves and we speak for ourselves and we will take care of our destines.” (Quoted in Bayer, 2002 p. 106).
As B. Gittings, propose a study, similar to E. Hookers, on lesbians, recruiting from the Daughters of Bilitis in 1971.  You can see the gamemaster or the original Siegelman, 1972.
Petition the conference committee for a display booth for 1972 titled 'Gay, Proud and Healthy', get Fryer and others to sit at the booth and take questions. As a student, if you are interested, there are photos of the actual booth available at http://digitalgallery.nypl.org/nypldigital/id?1606166. You should distribute a pamplet as well (the Kameny papers archive has a copy of the original, for inspiration).
You should maintain 'zapping' events where you determine discrimination, or the intellectual basis for discrimination, occur.
Help organize a symposium in 1973 on the topic of “Should Homosexuality Be in the APA Nomenclature?”

Your organization was the first that claimed homosexuality to be, “a preference, orientation, or propensity, on par with, and not different in kind from, heterosexuality”.  However, negative stigmas for homosexuality existed in propensity, thus counteracting the logic of your claims. You modeled a slogan after the African American movement’s, “Black is Beautiful”, thus coining the phrase, “Gay is Good”. America loves slogans, and the country’s “gut” began to shift into your corner. Today you are considered a pioneer in the homosexual civil rights movements, and cited as one of its most important figures.
When the Department of Defense launched an investigation into the sexuality of a young man named Benning Wentworth in 1969, you took the opportunity to testify. Charles Socarides was an expert witness for the prosecution. Your speech, “We Throw Down the Gauntlet” is not a classic in the gay rights movement. It is available here: http://www.kamenypapers.org/gauntlet.htm.
###Barbara Gittings Biography
You are a Librarian, activist and a pioneer of the American gay rights movement. You founded the New York chapter of the Daughters of Bilitis and edited its magazine, The Ladder. One of your life-long goals has been to get public libraries to provide more information on homosexuality to the public.
You were born on July 31, 1932 in Vienna, Austria. Your father, a career diplomat, was transferred back to the US in 1940, and your family settled in Delaware.
During your freshman year at Northwestern in 1949, you sought out therapy because you believed you might be a lesbian. The psychotherapist offered to cure you. Rather than submit to treatment, you went to the libraries to find information on homosexuality. The few resources you discovered were filed under 'perverted' or 'abnormal.' Moreover, the material on offer dealt almost exclusively with gay men.
As a result of the time you spent in the library researching homosexuality, you failed out of Northwestern. When you returned 'back east,' you moved to Philadelphia.
But you continued your research. In Philadelphia, you discovered a book titled The Homosexual in America (1951), written under the pseudonym 'Donald Webster Cory .'  You contacted the publisher and eventually contacted the author Edward Sagarin, who introduced you to the fledgling homophile movement, including the Mattachine Society.
When you went out to California to meet with the publishers of ONE, you met Phyllis Lyon and Del Martin, leaders of the lesbian organization Daughters of Bilitis. They asked you to found a chapter in New York, even though it meant a commute from Philly. You accepted.  
At a DOB meeting in 1961, you met another activist named Kay Lahusen. The two of you fell in love and soon became partners for life.
You succeeded Lyon and Martin as editor of DOB's magazine, The Ladder. During your three-year editorship, The Ladder began to publish articles critiquing medical authorities as well as the notion that homosexuals were sick.
In the early 1960's, your position in the DOB lead you to meet and collaborate with Frank Kameny.  Kameny's Washington DC chapter of the Mattachine Society was becoming more and more aggressive in its public advocacy, and you were encouraged. In 1965, you joined Kameny in a picket of  the White House. And the two of you organized annual demonstrations on July 4 at Independence Hall in Philly.
These tactics were not entirely welcome in the community at the time. You left the DOB because of these conflicts and joined Kameny's Mattachine society full time.
### Game Objectives
You are the leader of the Gay-PA. After the Stonewall protests of 1969, you've become committed to the idea that street-level protests and direct nonviolent confrontation ('Zaps') are the most effective mechanisms of social change.  You organized the San Francisco protests of 1970, and you have some ideas for 1971 and 1972.
The Gay-PA (in reality, the Chicago branch of the Gay Liberation Front) should issue something like following proclamation at the beginning of the conference in 1971 (distribute it as you see fit – i.e. post it to the door of the room, hand it out as players enter, etc.). It is vital that the draft is approved by the other members of the Gay-PA (Fryer, Hooker, Gold), and you should consult the secret 'young turks' (Marmor, Spiegel):
The establishment school of psychiatry is based on the premise that people who are hurting should solve their problems by “adjusting” to the situation. For the homosexual, this means becoming adept at straight-fronting, learning how to survive in a hostile world, how to settle for housing in the gay ghetto, how to be satisfied with a profession in which homosexuals are tolerated, and how to live with low self-esteem.
The adjustment school places the burden on each individual homosexual to learn to bear his torment. But the “problem” of homosexuality is never solved under this scheme; the anti-homosexualist attitude of society, which is the cause of the homosexual's trouble, goes unchallenged.  And there's always another paying patient on the psychiatrist's couch.
Dr. Socarides claims, “A human being is sick when he fails to function in his appropriate gender identity, which is appropriate to his anatomy.” Who determines “appropriateness”? The psychiatrist as moralist? Certainly there is no scientific basis for defining “appropriate” sexual behavior.... Other than invoking moral standards, Dr. Socarides claims that homosexuality is an emotional illness because of the guilt and anxieties in homosexual life.  Would he als consider Judaism an emotional illness because of the paranoia which Jews experienced in Nazi Germany?
We homosexuals of gay liberation believe that the adjustment school of therapy is not a valid approach to society.
We refuse to adjust to our oppression, and believe that the key to our mental health, and to the mental health of all oppressed peoples in a racist, sexist, capitalist society, is a radical change in the structure and accompanying attitudes of the entire social system.
Mental health for women does not mean therapy for women—it means the elimination of male supremacy. Not therapy for blacks, but an end to racism. The poor don't need psychiatrists (what a joke at 25 bucks a throw!)--they need democratic distribution of wealth. OFF THE COUCHES, INTO THE STREETS!
We see political organizing and collective action as the strategy for effecting this social change. We declare that we are healthy homosexuals in a sexist society, and that homosexuality is at least on part with heterosexuality as a way for people to relate to each (know any men that don't dominate women?).
Since the prevalent notion in society is that homosexuality is wrong, all those who recognize that this attitude is damaging to people, and that it must be corrected, have to raise their voices in opposition to antihomosexualism.  Not to do so is to permit the myth of homosexual pathology to continue and to comply in the homosexual's continued suffering from senseless stigmatization... We furthermore urge psychiatrists to refer to the homosexual patients to gay liberation (and other patients who are the victims of oppression to relevant liberation movements). Once relieved of patients whose guilt is not deserved but imposed, psychiatrists will be able to devote all their efforts to the rich—who do earn their guilt but not their wealth, and can best afford to pay psychiatrists'' fees.
We are convinced that a picket and a dance will do more for the vast majority of homosexuals that two years on the couch.  We call on the medical profession to repudiate the adjustment approach as a solution to homosexual oppression and instead to further homosexual liberation by working in a variety of political ways (re-educating the public, supporting pickets, attending rallies, promoting social events, etc.) to change the situation of homosexuals in this society.
Join us in the struggle for a world in which all humans are free to love without fear or shame.
(quoted in Rosario, 2002)

As a non-member of the APA, you cannot vote on the definition of mental illness. But be sure to advocate for one that does not penalize or marginalize those with harmless social differences.
#### Specific Assignments
Participate in the 1971 panel discussion with John Fryer and Evelyn Hooker. The texts of Kameny and Gitting's actual speeches are not recorded (to my knowledge), but Gittings' was probably titled “Gay, Proud and Healthy.”  Eyewitnesses record that Kameny was more confrontational and antagonistic to psychiatry while Gittings was more conciliatory. Kameny is quoted as arguing that “We're rejecting you all as our owners. We possess ourselves and we speak for ourselves and we will take care of our destines.” (Quoted in Bayer, 2002 p. 106).
As B. Gittings, propose a study, similar to E. Hookers, on lesbians, recruiting from the Daughters of Bilitis in 1971.  You can see the gamemaster or the original Siegelman, 1972.
Petition the conference committee for a display booth for 1972 titled 'Gay, Proud and Healthy', get Fryer and others to sit at the booth and take questions. As a student, if you are interested, there are photos of the actual booth available at http://digitalgallery.nypl.org/nypldigital/id?1606166. You should distribute a pamplet as well (the Kameny papers archive has a copy of the original, for inspiration).
You should maintain 'zapping' events where you determine discrimination, or the intellectual basis for discrimination, occur.
Help organize a symposium in 1973 on the topic of “Should Homosexuality Be in the APA Nomenclature?”

### Your Biography
You were born in London, England in 1911.  In 1933, you graduated from Columbia University's school of medicine with a degree in Psychiatry. After serving in the Navy during WWII, you moved to Los Angeles where you developed a successful psychiatric practice.  Over time, your practice became something of a 'favorite' of the hollywood elite. As a result, you became particularly famous both in the psychiatric community as well as popular culture.  In many ways, you are the most famous psychoanalyst practicing today.
While you are a Freudian, you have always worried about the scientific rigor of the tradition. You generally advocate for psychiatric practice based on scientific principles rather than theoretical grounding – and this is no more important than in the context of homosexuality.
Your practice as 'psychiatrist to the stars' meant that you were constantly approached by young men, some of whom were extremely famous, who sought to change their orientation from gay to straight.  You treated them according to the orthodox practice of uncovering the patient's repressed feelings of rejection caused by his cold and distant father and/or his misidentification with gender roles because of an overbearing mother. But these treatments just didn't work.  In your own writings on this subject, you described your experiences thusly: “The gay men I saw were caught up, for the most part, in the common myth that it was bad to be gay and that if they possibly could, they ought to try to be heterosexual. I was sympathetic to their wishes to try to become straight if they could...  We used to think in those days that psychoanalysis could cure everything, from chilblains to homosexuality.  But I wasn't too successful. Some were able to function bisexually but most of them remained gay.” (quoted in Kutchins &amp; Kirk, 1997, p. 63).
In 1956, Evelyn Hooker published her study of the mental health of gay men in San Francisco.  This changed everything. In retrospect, you have said “The first time I heard Dr. Evelyn Hooker state that homosexuality was not an illness, I wasn't prepared to go all the way. This was in 1956 when she presented her study of gay men. I was sympathetic to what she was saying but I wasn't totally convinced. I still had a feeling that it was a developmental deviation.”
Those 'feelings' dissipated during the 1960's, when you became increasingly frustrated with your attempts to change the behavior of the many homosexuals who have sought your skills as a psychoanalyst.  You ultimately concluded that homosexuality is not directly harmful to the mental health of the patients, but the psychic conflict caused by the patients' beliefs that homosexuality is a mental illness and their homosexual orientation is. Homosexuality is, in your view, just a normal variant of human sexuality, not a pathology.
This conviction has lead you into direct conflict with many of your Freudian peers, who continue to believe that homosexuality is a pathology.  You suspect that this belief persists in the psychiatric community because of a simple scientific error: the psychiatric community only sees an unrepresentative sample of homosexuals. By and large, psychiatrists are only exposed to homosexuals who seek treatment for their orientation. And that population is exactly the individuals who experience internal conflict between their homosexuality and their belief that it is a mental illness. If psychiatrists were to interact with 'normal' happy, healthy homosexuals outside the clinical setting, they would come to understand that the homosexuality itself is not a mental illness.
Freud mentions homosexuality a number of places in Introductory Lectures on Psychoanalysis, and it is crucially important that you study these carefully.  Freud believes that sexual life of children, which is regarded at the time as 'normal' includes a number of activities that would later in life be viewed as 'perverse', including same-sex contact.  In Freud's theory, heterosexuality develops with puberty in normal people. In 'inverts' or homosexuals, something goes wrong in this development. The object of ones' 'natural' desire--the genitels of the opposite sex—becomes transformed into parts of the body that represent those parts in the same sex.  Thus, homosexuality is no different in psychological mechanism than a foot fetish or any other neurotic 'perversion' (see p. 376-384 of Introductory Lectures) Homosexuality is not a psychologically isolated condition. According to Freud:
“We are compelled, however, to regard the choice of an object of one's own sex as a divergence in erotic life which is of positively habitual occurrence, and we are learning more and more to ascribe an especially high importance to it.” (p. 381)
In short, homosexuality is a kind of neurosis, yet it is not, itself, particularly worrying. The action itself is merely 'habitual,' and hence can be cured through standard habit-blocking therapy (Freud suggests that paranoia stops homosexuality on p. 381 of the Introductory Lectures).  It is, however, invariably an indicator of deeper psychological problems, as the transference and substitution of the 'natural' object of sexual desire to a different object will cause neurosis. See Ch 26 of the Introductory Lectures, especially p. 530, for Freud's explanation of homosexuality as neurotic narcissism.
The current advocates of this view are Charles Socarides and Irving Bieber.  They will be your main opponents in this game. Complicating matters somewhat, you were actually classmates with Irving Bieber at Columbia.  You were friends then, and that personal relationship may be at stake in this debate.
You are also an outspoken advocate for civil and human rights of all sort, having written papers in support of the Civil Rights movement, against McCarthyism and in opposition to the Vietnam war.
You are currently Director of Psychiatry at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center and Professor of Psychiatry at the University of Southern California.
### Game Objectives
You are a member of the secret faction 'The Young Turks' with John Spiegel. This is a group of politically progressive psychiatrists founded in 1970, after the events in San Francisco, dedicated to changing the direction psychiatry for the future. You have a connection to the 'Group for the Advancement of Psychiatry,' which has been advocating for progressive causes—specifically, limiting the use of electroshock therapy, ending the persecution of homosexuals by the US Military, desegregating the American south, etc—in psychiatry since the end of WWII.  
As a first step, the young turks (specifically you) will propose to the Board of Directors that homosexuality be removed from the next edition of the DSM during the 1971 conference.  Your colleagues in psychoanalysis are not necessarily your friends here. In fact, your Freudian colleagues Bieber and Socarides are your opponents.  On this issue, your friends are largely hidden. You will need to figure out who supports such a motion, and who does not.
During this process, you will need to work closely with the chair of the nomenclature committee Robert Spitzer.  He is convinced that homosexuality is a mental illness, but thinks that the main advocates of that position, Socarides and Bieber, are pushing a social / political agenda, not doing scientific work. You will have to convince him that psychic distress in homosexuals seeking treatment results from the mistaken belief that there is something wrong with being homosexual.  Curing that distress is not about curing homosexuality, it is about curing the individual's social/cultural prejudices.
In 1970, Socarides published a paper in the Journal of the American Medical Association titled “Homosexuality and Medicine” (212 (7): 1199). Introduce a resolution in 1971 during ‘new business’ condemning the article as unscientific and calling for its retraction. Your proposal should call Socarides' theory a “monstrous attack on homosexuality.”
Once homosexuality is removed from the taxonomy of mental illnesses, get elected president. If you cannot do that, get appointed to the Spitzer Task Force. In either of these roles, you should advocate for the president to appoint a special director or task force to lead the effort of removing the stigma of 'mental illness' from homosexuality.
It is likely that Socarides and Bieber will move to abdicate the vote of the nomenclature committee. If you are president in 1974, propose a referendum of the membership on the issue of the declassification  of homosexuality. If you are not, work with Spitzer and the President to move the issue to a referendum.
During the restructuring of the DSM-III, you should be chiefly concerned with protecting the psychoanalytic tradition.  While you think that homosexuality is not a mental illness, you are not willing to give up the 'dynamic hypothesis': the Psychoanalytic commitment to the etiology of mental illness in terms of inter-psychical conflict.
When, and if, the game reaches a point of trying to define mental illness, you must pass a psychoanalytic interpretation of mental disorder / illness. If a definition contains reference to a 'natural function' or another similar assumption, you should fight that proposal.
#### Specific assignments
During the first APA conference, you are to present your paper  “Limitations of Free Association” to the population.  The paper is available in Arch. Gen. Psychiat. 22:160-165, 1970.
As an initial member of the Research committee, you'll be called upon to judge the scientific legitimacy and ethical acceptability of proposed research programs.  You should make yourself familiar with the sections of the game book titled 'A Primer on Research Methods' and 'Ethics of Human Research'.  Your gamemaster will give you an additional sheet outlining the responsibilities of members of the research committee in evaluating proposals.
In 1971, propose that 'homosexuality' be removed from 302.00 of DSM-II.  In making this proposal, you should make sure you read out the actual language of 302.
In 1972, after Bieber's report comes in, you should propose a condemnation of Socarides' 1970 JAMA paper as a 'monstrous attack on homosexuality'. It is very, very rare for the APA to issue a public condemnation, so you will have to do your homework and be seriously prepared.
R. Green and J. Spiegel will be heading up a taskforce to report on the history of the homosexuality in psychology and psychiatry in 1972. He will invite responses to the report. You should be one of those responses. Bieber and/or Socarides will probably be the other one, so be prepared for a face-to-face debate in public on their view.
Fission: While you support the founding of the ApsaA, you are not willing to abandon the APA.

            <Title>Brief overview of the game</Title>
            <Text>### The Game
This game highlights the intellectual conflicts that changed American psychiatry and psychology in the early part of the 1970s.

 It might seem a little odd, in reacting game, to be exploring relatively recent events. While there will be no executions, ostracisms or civil wars in this game, the intellectual stakes are no less high. What you know of Psychiatry and Psychology today—the social significance of the APA's *Diagnostic and Statistical Manual *(DSM), the use of psychotropic drugs for 'everyday' life (such as Ritalin and Adderall), and the theoretically pluralistic basis of Psychology departments (behaviorism, cognitivism)—originate in this time period, in this conflict.  

The game, however, does contain a significant misnomer: in reality there are two distinct associations named 'APA.' The American Psychiatric Association, which is composed of Medical Doctors who practice Psychiatry, maintains the DSM. The American Psychological Association, which is composed of academics (PhDs) who study the mind in a variety of ways, does not.  In this game, we have conflated these two distinct associations. 

If you are interested in studying these events in closer detail, most characters with MDs are members of the American Psychiatric Association, while characters with PhDs are members of the American Psychological Association. 

During the course of this game, your class will be the ‘APA.’ Your class will be responsible for putting on annual conferences, where the nation's psychiatrists and psychologists meet to share their research and conduct association business. In 'real time', a single conference takes 1 week.  Each weekend of real time then, represents an entire year in game play time. According to your specific role, you may be presenting papers, participating in a symposium, serving on a committee, or even running for one.

Scheduling each conference is the responsibility of the conference committee.  The schedule for the first annual conference is already set: you can review it on p. &lt;!--\pageref{conferenceschedulefor1971}--&gt; . Pay careful attention to the schedule of submission and review detailed by the conference committee.  If your role sheet requires that you present your research at the conference, you must get your proposal to the conference committee on time. There is a detailed description of the form required for proposals provided under ‘&lt;!--\ref{callsforpapersandsymposia}--&gt;.’ on p. &lt;!--\pageref{callsforpapersandsymposia}--&gt;..  

#### Playing a Psychologist or Psychiatrist in the 1970s.
In 1974, the vast majority of psychiatrists would have been trained in the psychoanalytic tradition of Freud and Jung.  In psychology, the vast majority would have been trained as behaviorists.

 Each camp believed that they alone had a monopoly of the scientific study of the mind, and other traded in pseudoscience.  During the 1970s, crystalizing around the demedicalization of homosexuality, this all began to change.  

In this game, we ask you to put aside what you know about modern psychology and psychiatry, and put yourself in the shoes of a died-in-the-wool psychoanalyst or hard-nosed behaviorist.  

##### Context: the role of Psychology and Psychiatry in American Political Life
In 1964, a magazine called Fact asked 12,000 psychiatrists if they would be willing to diagnose conservative presidential candidate Barry Goldwater. Of the more than 2000 that responded 1,189 responded that he appeared to have a 'personality disorder'--that slippery category between psychosis and neurosis.  The headline proclaimed (under the magazine's title 'fact:') that “1,198 Psychiatrists Say Goldwater Is Psychologically Unfit To Be President! You may recall that the 1964 election witnessed Johnson's famous 'Daisy' ad, which suggested that the election of Barry Goldwater would lead to nuclear annihilation.  

At this same time, you may recall that the US Supreme court decided in 1973 that abortion was covered by the constitutional dictate to a right to privacy, thereby blocking all laws that had kept abortion illegal.

In 1969, the American Psychological Association issued a public proclamation, citing lack of evidence to the contrary that:
&gt;**WHEREAS** in many state legislature, bills have recently been introduced for the purpose of repealing or drastically modifying the existing criminal codes with respect to the termination of unwanted pregnancies;

&gt; and **WHEREAS**, termination of unwanted pregnancies is clearly a mental health and child welfare issue, and a legitimate concern of APA;

&gt; **BE IT RESOLVED** that termination of pregnancy be considered a civil right of the pregnant woman, to be handled as other medical and surgical procedures in consultation with her physician, and to be considered legal if performed by a licensed physician in a licensed medical facility.

The American Psychiatric Association followed in 1977 with:

&gt;The emotional consequences of unwanted pregnancy on parents and their offspring may lead to long-standing life distress and disability, and the children of unwanted pregnancies are at high risk for abuse, neglect, mental illness, and deprivation of the quality of life. Pregnancy that results from undue coercion, rape, or incest creates even greater potential distress or disability in the child and the parents. The adolescent most vulnerable to early pregnancy is the product of adverse sociocultural conditions involving poverty, discrimination, and family disorganization, and statistics indicate that the resulting pregnancy is laden with medical complications which threaten the well-being of mother and fetus. The delivery that ensues from teenage pregnancy is prone to prematurity and major threats to the health of mother and child, and the resulting newborns have a higher percentage of birth defects, developmental difficulties, and a poorer life and health expectancy than the average for our society. Such children are often not released for adoption and thus get caught in the web of foster care and welfare systems, possibly entering lifetimes of dependency and costly social interventions. The tendency of this pattern to pass from generation to generation is very marked and thus serves to perpetuate a cycle of social and educational failure, mental and physical illness, and serious delinquency.

&gt;Because of these considerations, and in the interest of public welfare, the American Psychiatric Association

&gt;1)	opposes all constitutional amendments, legislation, and regulations curtailing family planning and abortion services to any segment of the population; 

&gt;2) reaffirms its position that abortion is a medical procedure in which physicians should respect the patient's right to freedom of choice - psychiatrists may be called on as consultants to the patient or physician in those cases in which the patient or physician requests such consultation to expand mutual appreciation of motivation and consequences; and 

&gt;3) affirms that the freedom to act to interrupt pregnancy must be considered a mental health imperative with major social and mental health implications.


Needless to say, not only were these political events hugely controversial in the United States, the professional involvement of psychiatrists and psychologists was *itself* hugely controversial. 

The 'Goldwater affair', as it became to be known, embarrassed Psychiatry as a whole, painting the entire discipline as either politically motivated and unreliable (in the technical sense, that the same individual would not be classified the same way by a different analysts). 

 And the declarations regarding abortion were widely seen as unmotivated by scientific evidence.

To this day, academic organizations have a reputation of bias toward liberal political parties.  Given that contemporary conservatism traces its root to Goldwater’s failed presidential bid, it is unsurprising that conservative groups may still harbor some suspicion of academia.

            <Comments>Unlike many other professional organizations of the late 19th century, the APA immediately granted membership to women: specifically the eminent experimental psychophysicist Christine Ladd-Franklin and Margaret Washburn in 1894, two years after its founding. Mary Whiton Calkins was the first woman elected the first president in 1905.⁠1



1 Titchener, who was a founding member of the APA but probably never attended a meeting, created a separate organization called the “Experimentalists” in 1904, from which he explicitly barred women. Christine Ladd-Franking engaged in high profile war of words with Titchener until his death in 1925. Unfortunately, many people misremember this conflict as happening in the APA, which is incorrect. Also unfortunately, Titchener's student E.G. Boring wrote the most famous history of experimental psychology, in which he attacks Christine Ladd-Franklin as 'invading' laboratories and 'the women graduate students manicure her fingers' in the laboratory. (see 'Women scientists in American: struggles and strategies to 1940', p. 390)

            <Text>### Prologue

Your cab pulls up in front of the Shoreham hotel  in Rock Creek Park, a particularly tranquil part of the chaos that is Washington D.C. You nervously check the entrance to the hotel. It's clear. This year, there are no throngs of protesters bent on face-to-face confrontation.

They must be down at the mall participating in the massive protest calling for an end to the Vietnam war.  The radio reported an estimated crowd of at least 50,000. And that's before the 10,000 National Guardsmen were called into try to open the flow of traffic.

The story was not the same last year, in San Francisco.   

When you arrived at the hotel last year, the entrance was completely blocked by an angry crowd of gay rights activists. Individuals in the crowd were personally confronting—non-violently but aggressively—any member of the APA who appeared. The activists called this 'Zapping.' You found it terrifying.

There are rumors that the FBI was in attendance last year, and it is almost certain they are here now. Last year’s conference was almost shut down by the protesters. The Washington Post covered the event thusly:


&gt;The Washington Post May 14th 1970 -- The gay liberation and their women allies out-shrieked the head shrinkers today and took over an American Psychiatric Association session on sex. Before the morning was over the 500 psychiatrists who gathered to hear scientific studies on sexual problems demonstrated that they were just as prone to anti-social behaviour as anyone else. 'This lack of discipline is disgusting', said Dr Leo Alexander, a psychiatrist at the meeting. Then he diagnosed the problem of one of the lesbian protesters: 'She's a paranoid fool,' the doctor said, 'and a stupid bitch.'

The conference was a circus.  Young men dressed in flamboyant gowns stormed through the hallways. Sessions were disrupted by guerrilla theater. In one, an activist named Frank Kameny grabbed the microphone and shouted “Psychiatry is the enemy incarnate. Psychiatry has waged a relentless war of extermination against us. You may take this as a declaration of war against you.”

It all culminated in a session featuring Irving Bieber, author of the 1962 study on homosexuality published in his book *Homosexuality*.

According to eye witnesses, a protester interrupted Bieber almost before he started with the claim that “I've read your book Dr. Bieber, and if that book talked about black people the way it talks about homosexuals, you'd be drawn and quartered, and you'd deserve it!”  

Bieber tried to respond by claiming “I never said homosexuals were sick—what I said was that they had displaced sexual adjustment.”  

“That's the same thing, motherfucker!” yelled another.

It was a watershed moment.

Earlier this year, a meeting of the New York branch of the APA, a handful of gay activists  interrupted a talk by Charles Socarides.

There have long been rumors of a shadow organization of homosexual psychiatrists called the 'Gay-PA.’ It appears these rumors are no longer in doubt. The highlight of this year's program promises to be a symposium titled “Psychiatry: Friend or Foe to Homosexuals: A Dialogue.” The panel includes Dr. Evelyn Hooker, one of the participants in last year's show down and the mysterious 'Dr. H. Anonymous,' who claims to be both a licensed psychiatrist and homosexual.

Everyone knows that a mentally ill person cannot practice psychiatry. And homosexuality is a mental illness. This Dr. H. Anonymous, if he or she is telling the truth, is risking his or her medical license. But yet there must be more. We all know, ever since Kinsey's famous study, that about 10% of the population identifies as primarily homosexual, while a significantly larger percentage have engaged in homosexual activity.  And ever since Hooker's paper in 1956, we know that most of this population are psychologically normal. Given the numbers attending this meeting, Dr. H. Anonymous surely can't be alone.

On the other hand, Socarides and Bieber have called Hooker and Kinsey's data into question. If they are correct, and only a small percentage of the population is homosexual, on what basis could one call it a 'normal' behavior?  Are homosexuals, as Bieber contends, individuals whose “heterosexual function is crippled, like the legs of a polio victim”? What does it mean to be 'ill' anyway?


Back in October of 1969, Time magazine had a cover story on the movement amongst homosexuals for greater social recognition -who they called 'inverts.' In the second paragraph, it referred to “gay” bars (with the quotations), but then proceeded to use the word “gay” without quotes. It even used the term 'gay marriage.' The article, however, made the following claim:

&gt;Most experts agree that a child will not become a homosexual unless he undergoes many emotionally disturbing experiences during the course of several years. A boy who likes dolls or engages in occasional homosexual experiments is not necessarily "queer": such activities are often a normal part of growing up. On the other hand, a child who becomes preoccupied with such interests or is constantly ill at ease with the opposite sex obviously needs some form of psychiatric counseling. While only about one-third of confirmed adult inverts can be helped to change, therapists agree that a much larger number of "prehomosexual" children can be treated successfully

Who are these 'experts' who agree? Is this another Goldwater affair?

These thoughts raise a larger specter in your mind: are psychiatry and psychology *scientific*?

Starting a decade ago, Thomas Szasz, Professor of Psychiatry at State University of New York Health Science Center in Syracuse, New York has been arguing, quite publicly, that 'mental illness' is a myth!  His ideas challenge the very foundation of your field.  He's listed on the program, and you're quite excited to get a chance to discuss his polemic claims in some detail.

At the same time, the President of the APA this year is something of a revolutionary himself. George Miller has been arguing for the existence of something called 'Cognitive Psychology', which directly challenges the 50-year tradition of limiting psychological research to the observation, prediction and control of human behavior. For half a century, psychologists have been convinced cannot scientifically investigate unobservable entities like 'minds', but rather must study the behavior of an organism in its environment. Now even that is being challenged!

Are psychology and psychiatry scientific?  Is there such a thing as a 'mental illness'?  Can (or should) science be used to make the world  a better place?  </Text>

            <Text>#### Basic Principles
Academic associations like the APA not only provide their members with a forum through which they can socialize, share ideas and test or their most recent work; they also represent their discipline to the public. An association's president is often called upon to act as a spokesperson during times of controversy. The associations often define—sometimes very carefully—the qualifications someone must have to become a member.

During 1970's, the APA is being called upon to represent their membership in both of these ways.  It is important, therefore, to ensure that actions of the APA—whether it be the election of a new president or the publication of a statement—represent the will of the membership.  The association exists for the membership, not the other way around.

##### Reputation &amp; Replication
In academic culture, reputation is capital. But unlike other reputation-based cultures, your reputation depends entirely on the quality of data you produce, your creativity and insight in designing research, and your ability to explain the ideas in clear, simple terms.  

Disagreements are almost always professional: you can disagree vociferously with an opponent, yet respect his or her abilities as a scientist. On the flipside, those who cross the line between professional and personal disagreements run the risk of ruining both their professional and personal reputations.

At some point in your life—probably 7th grade—you were told that 'The Scientific Method' consists of creating hypotheses, designing experiments to test those hypotheses and then formulating a new hypothesis that can be tested.  But most importantly, you were probably told that scientific inquiry is distinguished from non-scientific inquiry insofar as scientific inquiry can be replicated by a stranger.  

That may be true, but notice that these claims are almost always made with the modal verb 'can.'  The sad truth is that few, if any, attempts at replicating scientific studies ever occur. The academy is not set up to encourage studies that reproduce known results. At educational institutions, tenure requirements force scientists to concentrate on producing novel results. Industries employ scientists to create new drugs, new techniques and new treatments, not to check the results of old ones. And practitioners are usually so swamped with the demands of their clientele that they may not be able to engage in research at all, let alone focus on replicating someone else's research.

All of that means that the academic culture relies heavily on reputation. It is generally assumed that academics are honest and that their results could be replicated, but will not be. Conferences, such as the APA, rely on a system of peer review to ensure that the papers presented represent the best research available.  But peer reviewers are often selected in virtue of their reputation for rigorous research and high standards. Members are elected to positions of leadership because of their reputation as psychologists or psychiatrists, not because of their knowledge of the rules of order for a public meeting. As you propose new research and present your findings at the conferences, remember that what counts is not entertainment value or charming banter, but quality of insight and rigor in data collection.

##### The Responsibilities of the President

While the presidency of the APA is largely an honorific position, it does come with some serious responsibilities.  It is awarded by election of the membership, according to standards known only to them. Traditionally, it has been given to significant figures in the field at the end of their careers as a kind of 'lifetime achievement' award (for example, Koffka in 1958) and advocates for new and promising avenues of research early in their careers. The first president in this game, George Miller, best exemplifies of the latter.

The President's main responsibilities include presiding over the meetings of the Board of Directors, and opening each conference with a plenary address. These addresses provide the president a huge forum to reflect on recent trends in the discipline and potential future directions.

All presidential addresses are published in the American Psychologist, which is available at Jstor.org. Potential presidents should consult the journal for examples.

            <Text>A Warning Sign on the Road to DSM‐5: Beware of its Unintended Consequences Allen Frances, MD
We should begin with full disclosure. As head of the DSM‐IV Task Force, I established strict guidelines to ensure that changes from DSM‐III‐R to DSM‐IV would be few and well supported by empirical data. Please keep this history in mind as you read my numerous criticisms of the current DSM‐V process‐especially its stated ambition to effect a "paradigm shift" in psychiatric diagnosis. It is reasonable for you to wonder whether I am carrying forward an inherently conservative bias or am protecting my own DSM‐IV baby. I think not and that instead I am identifying potentially grave problems in the DSM‐V goals, methods, and products. It is for the reader to judge my objectivity and the accuracy of my fears that, unless its course is corrected, DSM‐V will lead to many damaging unintended consequences.
Much of our work on the DSM‐IV centered on spotting and avoiding possible misuses of the system. Realizing that errors in the official system of psychiatric diagnosis can lead to all sorts of dreadful problems, we established a rigorous three‐stage procedure of empirical documentation to filter out mistakes. This consisted of systematic and extensive literature reviews, data reanalyses, and field testing that were conducted under well controlled conditions and in a wide variety of settings.1‐3 The null position was always to keep things stable. Thus, all suggested changes had to meet a high burden of empirical proof and risk/benefit analysis.
The work on DSM‐IV was transparent and widely inclusive.4 We knew how important it was to get as many critical comments as possible to assist us in spotting potential pitfalls and blind spots. To this end, we enlisted the help of over 1,000 advisors and, in particular, sought the opinions of those who were likely to be the most opposed to the possible changes being considered. In order to recruit as many comments as possible from users at large, we also prepared a regular and widely distributed newsletter and had a regular column in the journal Hospital and Community Psychiatry (now called Psychiatric Services).5
Our goal was to ensure that not only the DSM‐IV Task Force, but also the entire field, would understand precisely what we were doing and how we were going about it. The methods to be used for every step in the development of DSM‐IV were specified in advance and we closely adhered to them. It was made clear from the outset that there would be explicit accountability for decision‐making on all changes.
We published a number of articles to establish the methodology of the DSM‐IV empirical review, to indicate ways of judging the value and risks of "innovations,"5 and to fully discuss the pluses and minuses of the particular diagnostic changes that were under review.1,2,6‐9
In midstream, we published a widely distributed "Options Book"10 containing the alternative criteria sets proposed for every disorder. This gave everyone a chance to join us in evaluating each decision for change in DSM‐ IV. After the DSM‐IV was completed, we published four Sourcebooks, laying out in great detail the process and rationale for all the decisions that had been made, as well as their empirical support.11‐14
Why did we go to all this trouble in preparing DSM‐IV and why am I suggesting that the work on DSM‐V should now undergo a sharp mid‐term correction to provide safeguards by becoming far more transparent, explicit, and
conservative than it has been to date?
The work on DSM‐5 has, so far, displayed an unhappy combination of soaring ambition and remarkably weak methodology. First, let's expose the absurdity of the DSM‐V claim that it will constitute a "paradigm shift" in psychiatric diagnosis and indicate the dangers inherent in pursuing this false goal. The simple truth is that descriptive psychiatric diagnosis does not need and cannot support a paradigm shift. There can be no dramatic improvements in psychiatric diagnosis until we make a fundamental leap in our understanding of what causes mental disorders. The incredible recent advances in neuroscience, molecular biology, and brain imaging that have taught us so much about normal brain functioning are still not relevant to the clinical practicalities of everyday psychiatric diagnosis. The clearest evidence supporting this disappointing fact is that not even one biological test is ready for inclusion in the criteria sets for DSM‐5.
So long as psychiatric diagnosis is stuck at its current descriptive level, there is little to be gained and much to be lost in frequently and arbitrarily changing the system. Descriptive diagnosis should remain fairly stable until, disorder by disorder, we gradually attain a more fundamental and explanatory understanding of causality.
Remember that there has been only one paradigm shift in psychiatric diagnosis in the last 100 years‐‐the introduction of operational criteria sets and the multiaxial system in the DSM‐III.15,16 With these methodological advances, DSM‐III rescued psychiatric diagnosis from unreliability and the oblivion of irrelevancy. In the evolution of descriptive diagnosis, DSM‐III‐R and DSM‐IV were really no more than footnotes to DSM‐III and, at best, DSM‐V could only hope to join them in making a modest contribution. Descriptive diagnosis is simply not equipped to carry us much further than it already has. The real paradigm shift will require an increase in our knowledge‐not just a rearrangement of the furniture of the various descriptive possibilities.
Part of the exaggerated claim of a "paradigm shift" in DSM‐5 is based on the suggestion that it will be introducing 30 or more dimensional ratings and that this will increase the precision of diagnosis. I am a big fan of dimensional diagnosis and wrote a paper promoting its use as early as 1982.17 Naturally, I had hoped to expand the role of dimensional diagnosis in DSM‐IV, but I came to realize that busy clinicians do not have the time, training, or inclination to use dimensional ratings. Indeed, the dimensional components already built into the DSM system (i.e., severity ratings of mild, moderate, and severe for every disorder and the Axis V Global Assessment of Functioning scale) are very often ignored. Including an ad hoc, untested, and overly complex dimensional system in an official nomenclature is premature and will likely lead to similar neglect and confusion.18 Providing an opportunity for dimensional ratings certainly does not constitute a paradigm shift and should not be oversold.
If the potential gains of DSM‐V are likely to be extremely modest, the potential risks are great and, so far, have gone largely unrecognized. Making changes in the diagnostic system is never cheap or free of risks. Just as when treating an individual patient, the first consideration in revising the diagnostic classification must always be to "do no harm"‐and the harm inflicted by changes in the DSM diagnostic system can come in many, and usually unexpected, forms.
The most obvious adverse outcome is the significant burden to the field of having to learn and adapt to any changes included in DSM‐5. This cost will be borne by all clinicians, educators, administrators, and especially by mental health researchers.19 The most noxious changes are those that frivolously lead to a need for new diagnostic instruments (or result in findings that are not comparable over studies and over time). This wastes money, slows progress, and makes it far more difficult to translate research findings into clinical practice. Any "innovations" made in DSM‐5 should be clear and proven winners or they will not be worth the high overhead cost
inherent in any change. Moreover, my experience suggests that, unless strong supporting evidence is required for the changes made in DSM‐5, it is likely that many of the changes will inevitably be trivial, arbitrary, and excessively influenced by the views of one or several strong‐minded experts in any given work group.
There is also the serious, subtle, and ubiquitous problem of unintended consequences. As a rule of thumb, it is wise to assume that unintended consequences come often and in very varied and surprising flavors. For instance, a seemingly small and reasonable change can sometimes result in a different definition of caseness that may have a dramatic and totally unexpected impact on the reported rates of a disorder.20 Thus are false "epidemics" created. For example, although many other factors were certainly involved, the sudden increase in the diagnosis of autistic disorder, attention‐deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and bipolar disorder may in part reflect changes made in the DSM‐IV definitions. Note that this serious unintended consequence occurred despite the fact that careful field testing of the DSM‐IV versions of two of these disorders had predicted no substantial differences in their rates as measured by DSM‐III, DSM‐IV, and ICD‐10 criteria.21,22
The crucial lesson here is that even careful field testing is never completely accurate in predicting what will happen when the system is eventually used in the actual field. This issue becomes particularly poignant when one considers the great and skillful pressure that is likely to be applied by the pharmaceutical industry after the publication of DSM‐5. It has to be assumed that they will attempt to identify every change that could conceivably lead to a marketing advantage‐often in ways that will not have occurred to the DSM‐5 Task Force. In order to promote drug sales, the companies may well sponsor expensive "education" campaigns focusing on the diagnostic changes that most enhance the rate of diagnosis for those disorders that will lead to the increased writing of prescriptions. It should, therefore, be no surprise if there are many new "epidemics" based on changes in DSM‐V.
This risk is accentuated by the fact that the field testing for DSM‐5 will receive no support from the National Institute of Mental Health. The necessary resources will not be available to measure the impact of suggested changes on the reliability and reported rates of diagnoses in the widely varied settings in which DSM‐5 will be used. In addition, because no DSM‐5 Options Book or first draft is being produced, the "DSM‐5 field trials" are not really field trials at all‐they are no more than primary data collections that will have little to say about how the final draft of DSM‐5 will perform in the field. DSM‐V decision‐making regarding changes will therefore be flying fairly blind.
Further accentuating is that almost everyone responsible for revising the DSM‐5 has spent a career working in the atypical setting of university psychiatry. This type of clinical experience is restricted to highly selected patients who are often treated in a research context. It is a basic tenet of clinical epidemiology that research results and clinical experience derived from tertiary care settings often do not generalize well when the diagnostic system has to be applied routinely in a more population‐based manner.23,24
Thus, the attempt to shift paradigms in the DSM‐5 is built on a shallow foundation that will greatly increase the risk of embarrassing post publication surprises. The ways to minimize the risks are to be cautious in making changes and to demand high levels of evidence about their utility and impact.
Unintended consequences are particularly unpredictable and consequential in forensic settings. Years after the DSM‐IV was completed, we learned about the enormous and unintended impact of a seemingly slight wording change we had made only for technical reasons in the section on paraphilias. A misreading of our intentions in making the change had led to great confusion25‐with forensic evaluators using the diagnosis of paraphilia not otherwise specified (NOS) to justify the sometimes inappropriate lifetime psychiatric commitment of rapists who
had no real mental disorder. The lesson is that even small changes can have destructive unanticipated forensic consequences.
The likelihood that DSM‐5 will suffer from many and serious unintended consequences is enhanced by the way it is being done. "There are no constraints on the degree of change," according to a telling quote from Dr. David Kupfer, chairman of the DSM‐V Task Force.26 The work groups have been instructed to think innovatively about the disorders under their purview. They have received little guidance on the systematic methods that can be used when conducting literature reviews.6 They have also not reviewed the DSM‐IV Sourcebooks to learn from our experience in evaluating the pluses and minuses for many of the very same decisions they are now confronting. It is a fundamental error of the DSM‐5 process that it has no a priori methods in place to provide standards for making changes and for instructing Work Group members on how to do a careful risk/benefit analysis of each proposal.
Even a cursory review of some of the suggestions for DSM‐5 clearly illustrates the painful surprises that can inadvertently creep into a system if there are no careful doorkeepers to evaluate the risks of change. I will discuss some representative types of problems for purposes of illustration?but most of the suggested changes for DSM‐V will likely have
problems of one sort or another.
Undoubtedly, the most reckless suggestion for DSM‐V is that it include many new categories to capture the milder subthreshhold versions of the existing more severe official disorders. The beneficial intended purpose is to reduce the frequency of false negative missed cases?thus improving early case finding and promoting preventive treatments. Unfortunately, however, the DSM‐V Task Force has failed to adequately consider the potentially disastrous unintended consequence that DSM‐V may flood the world with new false positives. The reported rates of DSM‐V mental disorders would skyrocket, especially since there are many more people at the boundary than those who present with the more severe and clearly "clinical" disorders. The result would be a wholesale imperial medicalization of normality that will trivialize mental disorder and lead to a deluge of unneeded medication treatments‐‐a bonanza for the pharmaceutical industry but at a huge cost to the new false positive "patients" caught in the excessively wide DSM‐V net. They will pay a high price in side effects, dollars, and stigma, not to mentions the unpredictable impact on insurability, disability, and forensics.
In my experience, experts on any given diagnosis always worry a great deal about missed cases, but rarely consider the risks of creating a large pool of false positives?especially in primary care settings. The experts' motives are pure, but their awareness of risks is often naïve. Psychiatry should not be in the business of inadvertently manufacturing mental disorders. I would therefore suggest that none of the proposed subthreshold suggestions be converted into official diagnoses of mental disorder in DSM‐V. Each should instead be included in an appendix of suggested disorders that require more research and testing.
A second, related category of innovation would be to include as defined mental disorders "prodromal" forms of the schizophrenic, mood, dementing and perhaps other disorders. This again has the obvious appeal of promoting early case finding and preventive treatment, but it also has all the same devastating problems we have just discussed. For example, adding a new "pre‐psychotic" category for individuals supposedly at high risk for later developing a psychotic disorder would inevitably also capture an overwhelmingly large group of false positives who would never go on to have a psychotic illness. They would nonetheless be exposed to the stigma of having a pre‐psychotic diagnosis and would be overmedicated. Similarly, wouldn't it be nice to diagnose and treat early cognitive failure before it becomes dementia? But then almost everyone over sixty might qualify to receive a
probably useless, but highly promoted treatment.
This is a drug company's dream come true. They would undoubtedly find ways of penetrating the huge new markets with medications having largely unproven benefit and very substantial side effects. Also to be considered carefully are the always possible unforeseen problems caused by stigma and the unforeseen misuse of the new diagnoses in forensic, disability, and insurance settings. Finally, the clinching argument against including prodromes is that they are supported only by thin literatures and will not have extensive field trials to predict the extent of the false positive risks, especially in primary care settings. Again, it would be far better to put these suggestions in the DSM‐V appendix than to make them official mental disorders.
A third category of DSM‐V innovation would create a whole new series of so‐called "behavioral addictions" to shopping, sex, food, videogames, the Internet, and so on. Each of these proposals has received little research attention, and they all have the potential for dangerous unintended consequences, by inappropriately medicalizing behavioral problems, reducing individual responsibility, and complicating disability, insurance, and forensic evaluations. None of these suggestions are remotely ready for prime time as officially recognized mental disorders.
I do not have space to enumerate the dangers of all the other innovative suggestions for DSM‐V, but I will list just some of the riskiest that require the most careful review and caution: adult attention‐deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and adult separation anxiety disorder; making it easier to diagnose bipolar disorder; pediatric bipolar, major depressive, and trauma disorders; autism spectrum disorders; new types of paraphilias and hypersexuality disorder; and the suggested rating list to evaluate suicidality.
The DSM‐V Task Force should be (but is not) routinely and quickly shooting down suggestions with obvious risks. But it should also be carefully and deeply probing into the much less obvious risks posed by every change. Getting as much outside opinion as possible is crucial to smoking out and avoiding unforeseen problems. We believed that the more eyes and minds that were engaged at all stages of DSM‐IV, the fewer the errors we would make. In contrast, DSM‐V has had an inexplicably closed and secretive process.27 Communication to and from the field has been highly restricted. Indeed, even the slight recent increase in openness about DSM‐V was forced on to an unwilling leadership only after a series of embarrassing articles appeared in the public press.28‐30 It is completely ludicrous that the DSM‐V Workgroup members had to sign confidentiality agreements that prevent the kind of free discussion that brings to light otherwise hidden problems. DSM‐V has also chosen to have relatively few and highly selected advisors. it appears that it will have no Options Book to allow wide scrutiny and contributions from the field.
The secretiveness of the DSM‐V process is extremely puzzling. In my entire experience working on DSM‐III, DSM‐III‐ R, and DSM‐IV, nothing ever came up that even remotely had to be hidden from anyone. There is everything to gain and absolutely nothing to lose from having a totally open process. Obviously, it is much better to discover problems before publication‐and
this can only be done with rigorous scrutiny and the welcoming of all possible criticisms.
In summary, then, I have little confidence that the DSM‐V leadership will do the kind of careful risk/benefit analysis of each proposed change that is necessary to avoid damaging unintended consequences. My concerns arise from: 1) their ambition to achieve a "paradigm shift" when there is no scientific basis for one 2) their failure to provide clear methodological guidelines on the level of empirical support required for changes; 3) their lack of openness to wide scrutiny and useful criticism; 4) their inability to spot the obvious dangers in most of their current proposals; 5) their failure to set and meet clear timelines; and 5) the likelihood that time pressure will soon lead to an
unconsidered rush of last minute decisions.
This is the first time I have felt the need to make any comments on DSM‐V. Even when the early steps in the DSM‐ V process seemed excessively ambitious, secretive, and disorganized, I hoped that I could avoid involvement and believed that my successors deserved a clear field. My unduly optimistic assumption was that the initial problems of secrecy and lack of explicitness would self‐correct and that excessive ambitions would be moderated by experience. I have decided to write this commentary now only because time is beginning to run out and I fear that DSM‐V is continuing to veer badly off course?and with no prospect of spontaneous internal correction. It is my responsibility to make my worries known before it is too late to act on them. What is needed now is a profound mid‐term correction toward greater openness, conservatism, and methodological rigor. I would thus suggest that the trustees of the American Psychiatric Association establish an external review committee to study the progress of the current work on DSM‐V and make recommendations for its future direction.

### Your Biography
You are Stanley Milgram, social psychologist. You were born August 15, 1933 to a family of  Jewish immigrants from Germany who had settled in the Bronx and opened a bakery. By all accounts, you had a warm and untroubled childhood.
Your intelligence was spotted early in life and encouraged by your parents. In one legendary event, your experiments with your chemistry set brought the local fire department. You are most famous for your 'obedience' experiments starting in 1961 at Yale. These experiments sought to understand how normal people could do horrible things to others in the presence of an authority figure. Many people have drawn parallels between your experiments and the behavior of Nazi soldiers in the Holocaust, or even the actions of academics during the McCarthy era in the US. One biographer (Blass, 2004) has noted that your Bar Mitzvah speech was on the plight on European Jews under Hitler, and the McCarthy purges at Queens College occurred when you were enrolled.
After completing your undergraduate study in 1954, you applied to Harvard's Department of Social Relations, an interdisciplinary program that included social psychology, sociology, anthropology and clinical psychology. You were rejected.  You persisted, however, taking summer classes in psychology. Eventually, they let you in provisionally. You were admitted to the full program after a year.
There you worked with Solomon Asch, who was investigating conformity to group thinking by testing whether a subject would give the wrong answer to a question if it agreed with the group of experimental confederates.  For your dissertation, you extended this research by comparing Norwegians and French.
You moved to Yale in 1960, where you began designing your famous experiment. You submitted proposals to the National Science Foundation (NSF), the National Institutes of Mental Health (NIMH) and the Office of Naval Research.
You moved back to Harvard to direct the Department of Social Relations in 1963, but left for CUNY in 1966. You famous 'obedience' studies were conducted while you were at Yale. They have been the subject of great controversy, both from a scientific and ethical perspective.  As a student, make sure you are confident in the experimental protocol as well as the results. See Milgram 1963 and 1965 for the primary source report.
You now chair the graduate program in social psychology at CUNY.
In 1967, you published the famous 'small world' study, in which you randomly selected individuals in Omaha, Nebraska and Wichita, Kansas, and asked them to try to deliver a packet of information to a target person in Boston, Mass. If they did not know the target personally, they should give the letter to someone who might be able to pass it on.  Milgram then counted the number of contacts handled the packet in transit – the average was 5.5, giving us the common myth of 'six degrees of separation.'  
### Game Objectives
Get onto the research committee. While you have always had an interest in research ethics, the criticism of your experiments have made you develop something of an expertise in the APA standards (that means, of course, that you, as the student, need to develop an expertise with both Milgram's experimental design and the APA standards that are included in the gamebook).
You are neutral on the issue of the definition of mental illness.
#### Specific Assignments
If your class is larger than 16, you'll start as board-member-at-large for 1971.
Propose an experiment on campus testing the 'small world' problem in the campus environment in 1974.  Present your results (or, if the experiment is not completed in time, or denied by the research committee, the results of Milgram's original 1967 experiment) to the conference.
Oppose the proposal (from Clark, 1975) to create an affirmative action plan for psychology and psychiatry, on the grounds that it is an unwarranted authoritarian intervention in personal matters.  Milgram is quoted in Blass, 2004 (p. 201) as saying (in 1971):
 “There is some sense of progress and movement at the Graduate Center. A big question, however, is whether intellectual standards or political pressures will prevail in the conduct of our program. Already, we have been asked to recruit faculty on a racial basis, and we make exceptions to our usual admission standards in assessing potential black students. If carried too far, this could have disastrous consequences for the quality of the program. Then I'll leave.”
Present a paper summarizing your study of obedience (1963 and 1965) also in 1974, to complement the symposium on the social responsibility of academics.

            <Text>## Jean Piaget, PhD
### Your Biography
You were born in 1896 in Switzerland to Arthur Piaget, a professor of medieval literature at Neuchâtel University. You write, late in life, that you Mother's poor mental health 'intensly interested' in questions of psychology and psychoanalysis. This interest did not manifest at first, however, as your first passion was natural history. Many commentators have asserted this interest was born of an aversion to anything fantastical or hallucinatory. At the age of 11, you started to work with Paul Godet, Director of the Natural History Museum at Neuchâtel, on molluscs.  This work was so successful that when you were only 15, Maurice Bedot, director of the Natural History Museum at Geneva, offered you a position as an assistant in malacology.  You declined, explaining that you were too young.
You went to the University of Neuchâtel to study natural sciences, but happened upon a series of lectures by Carl Jung while spending a semester at the University of Zurich. After completing your Doctorate, you took a job teaching at a boy's school in France established by the psychologist  Alfred Binet.  It was there that you began seriously investigating child development.
Given your training and interest in natural science, you approached the problem of developmental psychology experimentally, testing the problem-solving skills of children of different ages. You concluded, after much observation, that the thinking structures of children differ from adults, and develop during different stages of the child's development.  That basic idea is core to all your theories of psychology.
You returned to Switzerland in 1921 as Director of the Rousseau Institute in Geneva. You married Valentie Châtenay in 1923, with whom you had three children: Jacqueline, Lucienne and Laurent.  
By carefully interviewing them (in a quasi-clinical setting) while they tried to solve problems you had set up, you developed your idea of 'genetic epistemology,' reflecting your emphasis on the origin of knowledge in development.  You theorize that the human mind has certain cognitive structures that correspond to different stages of development: sensorimotor, preoperational, concrete operational, and formal operational.  Contrary to the behaviorists, you do not believe that all learning is a matter of conditioning.  But at the same time, contrary to Descartes and the Port-Royalists, you don't believe it is innate either.  
According to you, children understands his or her world by adapting to new conditions and information using two basic ways: assimilation and accommodation.  'Assimilation' refers to the child's ability to fit current experiences into an existing conceptual structure, and 'accommodation' when the child has to create a new conceptual structure to understand new information. Understanding the psychology of a child, or a person, requires that we understand the cognitive structures he or she uses to understand his or her world.
Your view provides something of a counterpoint to the Freudian view of child development. While you both hold that the child psychology develops through a series of stages, you do not believe that the cognitive structures found in an adult would be found in a child.  It follows then that even if children engage in behaviors that adults would understand in a certain way (say, sexually), it does not mean that the child understands those behaviors in the same way. In fact, while you believe that psychoanalysis will not progress as a science until it unified its methodology to something more scientific (Freud never studied any actual children, for example), your main criticisms center around Freud's version of the genetic hypothesis. You share that criticism, of course, with Carl Jung.
### Game Objectives
You are something of an independent on most of the issues that come before the APA.  At this point in your career, you are an old man, considered to be one of the greats in the history of psychology.  On the other hand, the first behaviorist revolution saw members of your generation as the enemy. You are sympathetic to those challenging behaviorism, including the cognitivists. But you're also deeply concerned about the scientific validity of psychoanalysis.
Your specific task in this game is to engage the new revolutionaries—Chomsky in particular—in a public discussion or debate of the concept of 'innateness' in psychology, and the acceptability of positing innate ideas in a scientific enterprise. You should propose the event to the conference committee in time for it to happen in 1975.
As you will remember, the problem of innate ideas strikes the very core of the idea of the scientific study of the mind: the empirical hypothesis unifies the tradition as a whole, with the exception of Jungians. Moreover, the debate on homosexuality often turns, in the public mind at the least, on whether sexuality is innate (an 'orientation') or not (a 'preference').  The kind of innateness you and Chomsky are discussing is probably not the same, as you both agree that the structure of thought that is innate, not the content. This should be made clear in your public discussion.
Chomsky posits that the there is a innate system of grammars that are common to all humans, as a function of our biology. You believe there is a 'fixed nucleaus' of cognition that is innate, but say that “the functioning of intelligence alone is hereditary.”  The actual debate is recorded in Piatelli-Palmarini's 1980 book, which you should review during the course of the game.
You are neutral on the issue of the definition of mental illness.

Verbal behavior. By B. F. SKINNER.(The Century Psychology Series.) Pp. viii, 478. New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts, Inc., 1957.
Reviewed by NOAMCHOMSKYM,assachusettsInstitute of Technology and Institutefor AdvancedStudy
1. A great many linguists and philosophers concerned with language have expressed the hope that their studies might ultimately be embedded in a frame- work provided by behaviorist psychology, and that refractory areas of investi- gation, particularly those in which meaning is involved, will in this way be opened up to fruitful exploration. Since this volume is the first large-scale attempt to incorporate the major aspects of linguistic behavior within a behaviorist frame- work, it merits and will undoubtedly receive careful attention. Skinner is noted for his contributions to the study of animal behavior. The book under review is the product of study of linguistic behavior extending over more than twenty years. Earlier versions of it have been fairly widely circulated, and there are quite a few references in the psychological literature to its major ideas.
The problem to which this book is addressed is that of giving a 'functional analysis' of verbal behavior. By functional analysis, Skinner means identifica- tion of the variables that control this behavior and specification of how they interact to determine a particular verbal response. Furthermore, the controlling variables are to be described completely in terms of such notions as stimulus, reinforcement, deprivation, which have been given a reasonably clear meaning in animal experimentation. In other words, the goal of the book is to provide a way to predict and control verbal behavior by observing and manipulating the physical environment of the speaker.
Skinner feels that recent advances in the laboratory study of animal behavior permit us to approach this problem with a certain optimism, since 'the basic processes and relations which give verbal behavior its special characteristics are now fairly well understood ... the results [of this experimental work] have been surprisingly free of species restrictions. Recent work has shown that the methods can be extended to human behavior without serious modification' (3).1
1 Skinner's confidence in recent achievements in the study of animal behavior and their applicability to complex human behavior does not appear to be widely shared. In many recent publications of confirmedbehaviorists there is a prevailing note of skepticism with regard to the scope of these achievements. For representative comments, see the contribu- tionstoModernlearningtheory(byEstesetal.;NewYork,1954);Bugelski,Psychologyof learning (New York, 1956);Koch, in Nebraskasymposiumon motivation58 (Lincoln, 1956); Verplanck, Learned and innate behavior, Psych. rev. 52.139 (1955). Perhaps the strongest view is that of Harlow, who has asserted (Mice, monkeys, men, and motives, Psych. rev. 60.23-32 [1953])that 'a strong case can be made for the proposition that the importance of the psychological problems studied during the last 15 years has decreased as a negatively accelerated function approaching an asymptote of complete indifference.'

It is important to see clearly just what it is in Skinner's program and claims that makes them appear so bold and remarkable. It is not primarily the fact that he has set functional analysis as his problem, or that he limits himself to study of 'observables', i.e. input-output relations. What is so surprising is the particular limitations he has imposed on the way in which the observables of behavior are to be studied, and, above all, the particularly simple nature of the 'function' which, he claims, describes the causation of behavior. One would naturally expect that prediction of the behavior of a complex organism (or machine) would require, in addition to information about external stimulation, knowledge of the internal structure of the organism, the ways in which it proc- esses input information and organizes its own behavior. These characteristics of the organism are in general a complicated product of inborn structure, the genetically determined course of maturation, and past experience. Insofar as independent neurophysiological evidence is not available, it is obvious that inferences concerning the structure of the organism are based on observation of behavior and outside events. Nevertheless, one's estimate of the relative im- portance of external factors and internal structure in the determination of be- havior will have an important effect on the direction of research on linguistic
(or any other) behavior, and on the kinds of analogies from animal behavior studies that will be considered relevant or suggestive.
Putting it differently, anyone who sets himself the problem of analyzing the causation of behavior will (in the absence of independent neurophysiological evidence) concern himself with the only data available, namely the record of inputs to the organism and the organism's present response, and will try to describe the function specifying the response in terms of the history of inputs. This is nothing more than the definition of his problem. There are no possible grounds for argument here, if one accepts the problem as legitimate, though Skinner has often advanced and defended this definition of a problem as if it were a thesis which other investigators reject. The differences that arise between those who affirmand those who deny the importance of the specific 'contribution of the organism' to learning and performance concern the particular character and complexity of this function, and the kinds of observations and research necessary for arriving at a precise specification of it. If the contribution of the organism is complex, the only hope of predicting behavior even in a gross way
will be through a very indirect program of research that begins by studying the detailed cha.acter of the behavior itself and the particular capacities of the organism involved.
Skinner's thesis is that external factors consisting of present stimulation and the history of reinforcement (in particular the frequency, arrangement, and withholding of reinforcing stimuli) are of overwhelming importance, and that the general principles revealed in laboratory studies of these phenomena pro- vide the basis for understanding the complexities of verbal behavior. He confi-
now draw the conclusion that the causation of behavior is immensely more complex than was assumed in the generalizations of the past. A number of internal and external factors act upon complex central nervous structures. Second, it will be obvious that the facts at our disposal are very fragmentary indeed'-The study of instinct 74 (Oxford, 1951).

dently and repeatedly voices his claim to have demonstrated that the contri- bution of the speaker is quite trivial and elementary, and that precise prediction of verbal behavior involves only specification of the few external factors that he has isolated experimentally with lower organisms.
Careful study of this book (and of the research on which it draws) reveals, however, that these astonishing claims are far from justified. It indicates, fur- thermore, that the insights that have been achieved in the laboratories of the reinforcement theorist, though quite genuine, can be applied to complex human behavior only in the most gross and superficial way, and that speculative attempts to discuss linguistic behavior in these terms alone omit from con- sideration factors of fundamental importance that are, no doubt, amenable to scientific study, although their specific character cannot at present be precisely formulated. Since Skinner's work is the most extensive attempt to accommodate human behavior involving higher mental faculties within a strict behaviorist schema of the type that has attracted many linguists and philosophers, as well as psychologists, a detailed documentation is of independent interest. The mag- nitude of the failure of this attempt to account for verbal behavior serves as a kind of measure of the importance of the factors omitted from consideration, and an indication of how little is really known about this remarkably complex phenomenon.
The force of Skinner's argument lies in the enormous wealth and range of examples for which he proposes a functional analysis. The only way to evaluate the success of his program and the correctness of his basic assumptions about verbal behavior is to review these examples in detail and to determine the pre- cise character of the concepts in terms of which the functional analysis is pre- sented. ?2 of this review describes the experimental context with respect to which these concepts are originally defined. ??3-4 deal with the basic concepts 'stimulus', 'response', and 'reinforcement', ??6-10 with the new descriptive machinery developed specifically for the description of verbal behavior. In ?5 we consider the status of the fundamental claim, drawn from the laboratory, which serves as the basis for the analogic guesses about human behavior that have been proposed by many psychologists. The final section (?11) will consider some ways in which further linguistic work may play a part in clarifying some of these problems.
2. Although this book makes no direct reference to experimental work, it can be understood only in terms of the general framework that Skinner has developed for the description of behavior. Skinner divides the responses of the animal into two main categories. Respondentsare purely reflex responses elicited by particular stimuli. Operants are emitted responses, for which no obvious stimulus can be discovered. Skinner has been concerned primarily with operant behavior. The experimental arrangement that he introduced consists basically of a box with a bar attached to one wall in such a way that when the bar is pressed, a food pellet is dropped into a tray (and the bar press is recorded). A rat placed in the box will soon press the bar, releasing a pellet into the tray. This state of affairs, resulting from the bar press, increases the strengthof the bar-
￼REVIEWS 29
pressing operant. The food pellet is called a reinforcer;the event, a reinforcing event. The strength of an operant is defined by Skinner in terms of the rate of response during extinction (i.e. after the last reinforcement and before return to the preconditioning rate).
Suppose that release of the pellet is conditional on the flashing of a light. Then the rat will come to press the bar only when the light flashes. This is called stimulus discrimination. The response is called a discriminated operant and the light is called the occasionfor its emission; this is to be distinguished from elicita- tion of a response by a stimulus in the case of the respondent.2Suppose that the apparatus is so arranged that bar-pressing of only a certain character (e.g. duration) will release the pellet. The rat will then come to press the bar in the required way. This process is called response differentiation.By successive slight changes in the conditions under which the response will be reinforced it is pos-
sible to shape the response of a rat or a pigeon in very surprising ways in a very short time, so that rather complex behavior can be produced by a process of successive approximation.
A stimulus can become reinforcing by repeated association with an already reinforcing stimulus. Such a stimulus is called a secondaryreinforcer.Like many contemporary behaviorists, Skinner considers money, approval, and the like to be secondary reinforcers which have become reinforcing because of their associa- tion with food etc.3 Secondary reinforcers can be generalizedby associating them with a variety of different primary reinforcers.
Another variable that can affect the rate of the bar-pressing operant is drive, which Skinner defines operationally in terms of hours of deprivation. His major scientific book, Behavior of organisms, is a study of the effects of food-depriva- tion and conditioning on the strength of the bar-pressing response of healthy mature rats. Probably Skinner's most original contribution to animal behavior studies has been his investigation of the effects of intermittent reinforcement, arranged in various different ways, presented in Behavior of organisms and ex- tended (with pecking of pigeons as the operant under investigation) in the re- cent Schedules of reinforcementby Ferster and Skinner (1957). It is apparently
2InBehavioroforganisms(NewYork,1938),Skinnerremarksthat'althoughacondi- tioned operant is the result of the correlation of the response with a particular reinforce- ment, a relation between it and a discriminative stimulus acting prior to the response is the almost universal rule' (178-9). Even emitted behavior is held to be produced by some sort of
'originating force' (51) which, in the case of operant behavior is not under experimental control. The distinction between eliciting stimuli, discriminated stimuli, and 'originating forces' has never been adequately clarified, and becomes even more confusing when private internal events are considered to be discriminated stimuli (see below).
3 In a famous experiment, chimpanzees were taught to perform complex tasks to receive tokens which had become secondary reinforcers because of association with food. The idea that money, approval, prestige, etc. actually acquire their motivating effects on human behavior according to this paradigm is unproved, and not particularly plausible. Many psychologists within the behaviorist movement are quite skeptical about this (cf. fn. 23). As in the case of most aspects of human behavior, the evidence about secondary reinforce- ment is so fragmentary, conflicting, and complex that almost any view can find some sup- port.

these studies that Skinner has in mind when he refers to the recent advances in the study of animal behavior.4
The notions 'stimulus', 'response', 'reinforcement' are relatively well defined with respect to the bar-pressing experiments and others similarly restricted. Before we can extend them to real-life behavior, however, certain difficulties must be faced. We must decide, first of all, whether any physical event to which the organism is capable of reacting is to be called a stimulus on a given occasion, or only one to which the organism in fact reacts; and correspondingly, we must decide whether any part of behavior is to be called a response, or only one con- nected with stimuli in lawful ways. Questions of this sort pose something of a dilemma for the experimental psychologist. If he accepts the broad definitions, characterizing any physical event impinging on the organism as a stimulus and any part of the organism's behavior as a response, he must conclude that be- havior has not been demonstrated to be lawful. In the present state of our knowledge, we must attribute an overwhelming influence on actual behavior to ill-defined factors of attention, set, volition, and caprice. If we accept the nar- rower definitions, then behavior is lawful by definition (if it consists of responses); but this fact is of limited significance, since most of what the animal does will simply not be considered behavior. Hence the psychologist either must admit that behavior is not lawful (or that he cannot at present show that it is-not at all a damaging admission for a developing science), or must restrict his atten- tion to those highly limited areas in which it is lawful (e.g. with adequate con- trols, bar-pressing in rats; lawfulness of the observed behavior provides, for Skinner, an implicit definition of a good experiment).
Skinner does not consistently adopt either course. He utilizes the experimental results as evidence for the scientific character of his system of behavior, and analogic guesses (formulated in terms of a metaphoric extension of the technical vocabulary of the laboratory) as evidence for its scope. This creates the illusion of a rigorous scientific theory with a very broad scope, although in fact the terms used in the description of real-life and of laboratory behavior may be mere homonyms, with at most a vague similarity of meaning. To substantiate this
4 Skinner's remark quoted above about the generality of his basic results must be under- stood in the light of the experimental limitations he has imposed. If it were true in any deep sense that the basic processes in language are well understood and free of species restric- tions, it would be extremely odd that language is limited to man. With the exception of a few scattered observations (cf. his article, A case history in scientific method, The American psychologist 11.221-33[1956]),Skinneris apparently basing this claim on the fact that quali- tatively similarresultsareobtainedwithbar-pressingofratsandpeckingofpigeonsunder special conditions of deprivation and various schedules of reinforcement. One immediately questions how much can be based on these facts, which are in part at least an artifact trace- able to experimental design and the definition of 'stimulus' and 'response' in terms of 'smooth dynamic curves' (see below). The dangers inherent in any attempt to 'extrapolate' to complex behavior from the study of such simple responses as bar-pressing should be ob- vious, and have often been commented on (cf. e.g. Harlow, op.cit.). The generality of even the simplest results is open to serious question. Cf. in this connection Bitterman, Wodinsky, and Candland, Some comparative psychology, Am. jour. of psych. 71.94-110 (1958), where it is shown that there are important qualitative differences in solution of comparable ele-
mentary problems by rats and fish.

evaluation, a critical account of his book must show that with a literal reading (where the terms of the descriptive system have something like the technical meanings given in Skinner's definitions) the book covers almost no aspect of linguistic behavior, and that with a metaphoric reading, it is no more scientific than the traditional approaches to this subject matter, and rarely as clear and
careful.6
3. Consider first Skinner's use of the notions 'stimulus' and 'response'. In Behavior of organisms (9) he commits himself to the narrow definitions for these terms. A part of the environment and a part of behavior are called stimulus (eliciting, discriminated, or reinforcing) and response, respectively, only if they are lawfully related; that is, if the 'dynamic laws' relating them show smooth and reproducible curves. Evidently stimuli and responses, so defined, have not been shown to figure very widely in ordinary human behavior.6 We can, in the face of presently available evidence, continue to maintain the lawfulness of the relation between stimulus and response only by depriving them of their objective character. A typical example of 'stimulus control' for Skinner would be the response to a piece of music with the utterance Mozart or to a painting with the response Dutch. These responses are asserted to be 'under the control of extremely subtle properties' of the physical object or event (108). Suppose instead of saying Dutch we had said Clashes with the wallpaper, I thoughtyou liked abstractwork, Never saw it before, Tilted, Hanging too low, Beautiful, Hideous, Rememberour camping trip last summer?,or whatever else might come into our minds when looking at a picture (in Skinnerian translation, whatever other responses exist in sufficient strength). Skinner could only say that each of these responses is under the control of some other stimulus property of the physical object. If we look at a red chair and say red, the response is under the control of the stimulus 'redness'; if we say chair, it is under the control of the collection of properties (for Skinner, the object) 'chairness' (110), and similarly for any other response. This device is as simple as it is empty. Since properties are free for the asking
5 An analogous argument, in connection with a different aspect of Skinner's thinking, is givenbyScriveninAstudyofradicalbehaviorism= Univ.ofMinn.studiesinphilosophyof science, Vol. 1. Cf. Verplanck's contribution to Modernlearning theory (283-8) for more general discussion of the difficulties in formulating an adequate definition of 'stimulus' and 'response'. He concludes, quite correctly, that in Skinner's sense of the word, stimuli are not objectively identifiable independently of the resulting behavior, nor are they manipu- lable.VerplanckpresentsacleardiscussionofmanyotheraspectsofSkinner'ssystem, com- menting on the untestability of many of the so-called 'laws of behavior' and the limited scope of many of the others, and the arbitrary and obscure character of Skinner's notion of 'lawful relation'; and, at the same time, noting the importance of the experimental data that Skinner has accumulated.
6 In Behavior of organisms, Skinner apparently was willing to accept this consequence. He insists (41-2) that the terms of casual description in the popular vocabulary are not validly descriptive until the defining properties of stimulus and response are specified, the correlation is demonstrated experimentally, and the dynamic changes in it are shown to be lawful. Thus, in describing a child as hiding from a dog, 'it will not be enough to dig- nify the popular vocabulary by appealing to essential properties of "dogness" or "hiding- ness" and to suppose them intuitively known.' But this is exactly what Skinner does in the book under review, as we will see directly.
￼32 LANGUAGE, VOLUME 35, NUMBER 1 (1959)
(we have as many of them as we have nonsynonymous descriptive expressions in our language, whatever this means exactly), we can account for a wide class of responses in terms of Skinnerian functional analysis by identifying the 'con- trolling stimuli'. But the word 'stimulus' has lost all objectivity in this usage. Stimuli are no longer part of the outside physical world; they are driven back into the organism. We identify the stimulus when we hear the response. It is clear from such examples, which abound, that the talk of 'stimulus control' simply disguises a complete retreat to mentalistic psychology. We cannot pre- dict verbal behavior in terms of the stimuli in the speaker's environment, since we do not know what the current stimuli are until he responds. Furthermore, since we cannot control the property of a physical object to which an individual will respond, except in highly artificial cases, Skinner's claim that his system, as opposed to the traditional one, permits the practical control of verbal be- havior7is quite false.
Other examples of 'stimulus control' merely add to the general mystification. Thus a proper noun is held to be a response 'under the control of a specific person or thing' (as controlling stimulus, 113). I have often used the words Eisenhower and Moscow, which I presume are proper nouns if anything is, but have never been 'stimulated' by the corresponding objects. How can this fact be made compatible with this definition? Suppose that I use the name of a friend who is not present. Is this an instance of a proper noun under the control of the friend as stimulus? Elsewhere it is asserted that a stimulus controls a response in the sense that presence of the stimulus increases the probability of the re- sponse. But it is obviously untrue that the probability that a speaker will pro- duce a full name is increased when its bearer faces the speaker. Furthermore,
7 253 f. and elsewhere, repeatedly. As an example of how well we can control behavior using the notions developed in this book, Skinner shows here how he would go about evok- ing the response pencil. The most effective way, he suggests, is to say to the subject 'Please say pencil' (our chances would, presumably, be even further improved by use of 'aversive stimulation', e.g.holdingaguntohishead).Wecanalso'makesurethatnopencilorwriting instrument is available, then hand our subject a pad of paper appropriate to pencil sketch- ing, and offer him a handsome reward for a recognizable picture of a cat.' It would also be useful to have voices saying pencil or pen and ... in the background; signs reading pencil or pen and ... ; or to place a 'large and unusual pencil in an unusual place clearly in sight'. 'Under such circumstances, it is highly probable that our subject will say pencil.' 'The available techniques are all illustrated in this sample.' These contributions of behav- ior theory to the practical control of human behavior are amply illustrated elsewhere in the book, as when Skinner shows (113-4) how we can evoke the response red (the device suggested is to hold a red object before the subject and say 'Tell me what color this is').
In fairness, it must be mentioned that there are certain nontrivial applications of 'op- erant conditioning' to the control of human behavior. A wide variety of experiments have shown that the number of plural nouns (for example) produced by a subject will increase if the experimenter says 'right' or 'good' when one is produced (similarly, positive attitudes on a certain issue, stories with particular content, etc.; cf. Krasner, Studies of the condi- tioning of verbal behavior, Psych. bull., Vol. 55 [1958],for a survey of several dozen experi- ments of this kind, mostly with positive results). It is of some interest that the subject is usually unaware of the process. Just what insight this gives into normal verbal behavior is not obvious. Nevertheless, it is an example of positive and not totally expected results us- ing the Skinnerian paradigm.

how can one's own name be a proper noun in this sense? A multitude of similar questions arise immediately. It appears that the word 'control' here is merely a misleading paraphrase for the traditional 'denote' or 'refer'. The assertion (115) that so far as the speaker is concerned, the relation of reference is 'simply the probability that the speaker will emit a response of a given form in the presence of a stimulus having specified properties' is surely incorrect if we take the words 'presence', 'stimulus', and 'probability' in their literal sense. That they are not intended to be taken literally is indicated by many examples, as when a response is said to be 'controlled' by a situation or state of affairs as 'stimulus'. Thus, the expression a needle in a haystack 'may be controlled as a unit by a particular type of situation' (116); the words in a single part of speech, e.g. all adjectives, are under the control of a single set of subtle properties of stimuli (121); 'the sentence The boy runs a storeis under the control of an extremely complex stim- ulus situation' (335); 'He is not at all well may function as a standard response under the control of a state of affairs which might also control He is ailing' (325); when an envoy observes events in a foreign country and reports upon his return, his report is under 'remote stimulus control' (416); the statement This is war may be a response to a 'confusing international situation' (441); the suffix -ed is controlled by that 'subtle property of stimuli which we speak of as action-in-the-past' (121) just as the -s in The boy runs is under the control of such specific features of the situation as its 'currency' (332). No characterization of the notion 'stimulus control' that is remotely related to the bar-pressing ex- periment (or that preserves the faintest objectivity) can be made to cover a set of examples like these, in which, for example, the 'controlling stimulus' need not even impinge on the responding organism.
Consider now Skinner's use of the notion 'response'. The problem of identi- fying units in verbal behavior has of course been a primary concern of linguists, and it seems very likely that experimental psychologists should be able to pro- vide much-needed assistance in clearing up the many remaining difficulties in systematic identification. Skinner recognizes (20) the fundamental character of the problem of identification of a unit of verbal behavior, but is satisfied with an answer so vague and subjective that it does not really contribute to its solu- tion. The unit of verbal behavior-the verbal operant-is defined as a class of responses of identifiable form functionally related to one or more controlling variables. No method is suggested for determining in a particular instance what are the controlling variables, how many such units have occurred, or where their boundaries are in the total response. Nor is any attempt made to specify how much or what kind of similarity in form or 'control' is required for two physical events to be considered instances of the same operant. In short, no answers are suggested for the most elementary questions that must be asked of anyone pro- posing a method for description of behavior. Skinner is content with what he calls an 'extrapolation' of the concept of operant developed in the laboratory to the verbal field. In the typical Skinnerian experiment, the problem of identify- ing the unit of behavior is not too crucial. It is defined, by fiat, as a recorded peck or bar-press, and systematic variations in the rate of this operant and its
￼34 LANGUAGE, VOLUME 35, NUMBER 1 (1959)
resistance to extinction are studied as a function of deprivation and scheduling of reinforcement (pellets). The operant is thus defined with respect to a particu- lar experimental procedure. This is perfectly reasonable, and has led to many interesting results. It is, however, completely meaningless to speak of extrapo- lating this concept of operant to ordinary verbal behavior. Such 'extrapolation' leaves us with no way of justifying one or another decision about the units in the 'verbal repertoire'.
Skinner specifies 'response strength' as the basic datum, the basic dependent variable in his functional analysis. In the bar-pressing experiment, response strength is defined in terms of rate of emission during extinction. Skinner has argued8that this is 'the only datum that varies significantly and in the expected direction under conditions which are relevant to the "learning process".' In the book under review, response strength is defined as 'probability of emission' (22). This definition provides a comforting impression of objectivity, which, however, is quickly dispelled when we look into the matter more closely. The term 'proba- bility' has some rather obscure meaning for Skinner in this book.9 We are told, on the one hand, that 'our evidence for the contribution of each variable [to response strength] is based on observation of frequencies alone' (28). At the same time, it appears that frequency is a very misleading measure of strength, since, for example, the frequency of a response may be 'primarily attributable to the frequency of occurrence of controlling variables' (27). It is not clear how the frequency of a response can be attributable to anything BUT the fre- quency of occurrence of its controlling variables if we accept Skinner's view
that the behavior occurring in a given situation is 'fully determined' by the
relevant controlling variables (175, 228). Furthermore, although the evidence for the contribution of each variable to response strength is based on observation of frequencies alone, it turns out that 'we base the notion of strength upon several kinds of evidence' (22), in particular (22-8): emission of the response (particularly in unusual circumstances), energy level (stress), pitch level, speed and delay of emission, size of letters etc. in writing, immediate repetition, and-
a final factor, relevant but misleading-over-all frequency.
Of course, Skinner recognizes that these measures do not co-vary, because
(among other reasons) pitch, stress, quantity, and reduplication may have in-
8 Aretheoriesoflearningnecessary?,Psych.rev.57.193-216(1950).
9And elsewhere. In his paper Are theories of learning necessary?, Skinner considers the
problem how to extend his analysis of behavior to experimental situations in which it is
impossible to observe frequencies, rate of response being the only valid datum. His answer is that 'the notion of probability is usually extrapolated to cases in which a frequency analysis cannot be carried out. In the field of behavior we arrange a situation in which frequencies are available as data, but we use the notion of probability in analyzing or for- mulating instances of even types of behavior which are not susceptible to this analysis' (199). There are, of course, conceptions of probability not based directly on frequency, but I do not see how any of these apply to the cases that Skinner has in mind. I see no way of interpreting the quoted passage other than as signifying an intention to use the word
'probability' in describing behavior quite independently of whether the notion of proba- bility is at all relevant.
￼REVIEWS 35
ternal linguistic functions.'0 However, he does not hold these conflicts to be very important, since the proposed factors indicative of strength are 'fully understood by everyone' in the culture (27). For example, 'if we are shown a prized work of art and exclaim Beautiful!, the speed and energy of the response will not be lost on the owner.' It does not appear totally obvious that in this case the way to impress the owner is to shriek Beautiful in a loud, high-pitched voice, repeatedly, and with no delay (high response strength). It may be equally effective to look at the picture silently (long delay), and then to murmur Beau- tiful in a soft, low-pitched voice (by definition, very low response strength).
It is not unfair, I believe, to conclude from Skinner's discussion of response strength, the 'basic datum' in functional analysis, that his 'extrapolation' of the notion of probability can best be interpreted as, in effect, nothing more than a decision to use the word 'probability', with its favorable connotations of ob- jectivity, as a cover term to paraphrase such low-status words as 'interest', 'intention', 'belief', and the like. This interpretation is fully justified by the way in which Skinner uses the terms 'probability' and 'strength'. To cite just one example, Skinner defines the process of confirming an assertion in science as one of 'generating additional variables to increase its probability' (425), and more generally, its strength (425-9). If we take this suggestion quite literally, the degree of confirmation of a scientific assertion can be measured as a simple function of the loudness, pitch, and frequency with which it is proclaimed, and a general procedure for increasing its degree of confirmation would be, for in- stance, to train machine guns on large crowds of people who have been instructed to shout it. A better indication of what Skinner probably has in mind here is given by his description of how the theory of evolution, as an example, is con- firmed. This 'single set of verbal responses ... is made more plausible- is strengthened-by several types of construction based upon verbal responses in geology, paleontology, genetics, and so on' (427). We are no doubt to inter- pret the terms 'strength' and 'probability' in this context as paraphrases of more familiar locutions such as 'justified belief' or 'warranted assertability', or something of the sort. Similar latitude of interpretation is presumably expected
when we read that 'frequency of effective action accounts in turn for what we may call the listener's "belief" ' (88) or that 'our belief in what someone tells us is similarly a function of, or identical with, our tendency to act upon the verbal stimuli which he provides' (160)."
10Fortunately, 'In English this presents no great difficulty' since, for example, 'relative pitch levels ... are not ... important' (25). No reference is made to the numerous studies of the function of relative pitch levels and other intonational features in English.
11The vagueness of the word 'tendency', as opposed to 'frequency', saves the latter quotationfromtheobviousincorrectnessoftheformer.Nevertheless, agooddealofstretch- ing is necessary. If 'tendency' has anything like its ordinarymeaning, the remarkis clearly false. One may believe strongly the assertion that Jupiter has four moons, that many of Sophocles' plays have been irretrievably lost, that the earth will burn to a crisp in ten million years, etc., without experiencing the slightest tendency to act upon these verbal stimuli. We may, of course, turn Skinner's assertion into a very unilluminating truth by defining 'tendency to act' to include tendencies to answer questions in certain ways, under motivation to say what one believes is true.
￼36 LANGUAGE, VOLUME 35, NUMBER 1 (1959)
I think it is evident, then, that Skinner's use of the terms 'stimulus', 'control', 'response', and 'strength' justify the general conclusion stated in the last para- graph of ?2 above. The way in which these terms are brought to bear on the actual data indicates that we must interpret them as mere paraphrases for the popular vocabulary commonly used to describe behavior, and as having no particular connection with the homonymous expressions used in the description of laboratory experiments. Naturally, this terminological revision adds no ob- jectivity to the familiar 'mentalistic' mode of description.
4. The other fundamental notion borrowed from the description of bar- pressing experiments is 'reinforcement'. It raises problems which are similar, and even more serious. In Behavior of organisms, 'the operation of reinforcement is defined as the presentation of a certain kind of stimulus in a temporal relation with either a stimulus or response. A reinforcing stimulus is defined as such by its power to produce the resulting change [in strength]. There is no circularity about this: some stimuli are found to produce the change, others not, and they are classified as reinforcing and non-reinforcing accordingly' (62). This is a per- fectly appropriate definitionl2for the study of schedules of reinforcement. It is perfectly useless, however, in the discussion of real-life behavior, unless we can somehow characterize the stimuli which are reinforcing (and the situations and conditions under which they are reinforcing). Consider first of all the status of the basic principle that Skinner calls the 'law of conditioning' (law of effect). It reads: 'if the occurrence of an operant is followed by presence of a reinforcing stimulus, the strength is increased' (Behavior of organisms 21). As 'reinforce- ment' was defined, this law becomes a tautology.13 For Skinner, learning is just change in response strength.'4 Although the statement that presence of reinforce- ment is a sufficient condition for learning and maintenance of behavior is vacu- ous, the claim that it is a necessary condition may have some content, depending on how the class of reinforcers (and appropriate situations) is characterized. Skinner does make it very clear that in his view reinforcement is a necessary condition for language learning and for the continued availability of linguistic responses in the adult.15However, the looseness of the term 'reinforcement' as
12 Oneshouldadd,however,thatitisingeneralnotthestimulusassuchthatisreinforc- ing, but the stimulus in a particular situational context. Depending on experimental ar- rangement, a particular physical event or object may be reinforcing, punishing, or un- noticed. Because Skinner limits himself to a particular, very simple experimental arrangement, it is not necessary for him to add this qualification, which would not be at all easy to formulate precisely. But it is of course necessary if he expects to extend his descriptive system to behavior in general.

Skinner uses it in the book under review makes it entirely pointless to inquire into the truth or falsity of this claim. Examining the instances of what Skinner calls 'reinforcement', we find that not even the requirement that a reinforcer be an identifiable stimulus is taken seriously. In fact, the term is used in such a way that the assertion that reinforcement is necessary for learning and contin- ued availability of behavior is likewise empty.
To show this, we consider some example of 'reinforcement'. First of all, we find a heavy appeal to automatic self-reinforcement. Thus, 'a man talks to himself ... because of the reinforcement he receives' (163); 'the child is reinforced automatically when he duplicates the sounds of airplanes, streetcars ...' (164);
'the young child alone in the nursery may automatically reinforce his own ex- ploratory verbal behavior when he produces sounds which he has heard in the speech of others' (58); 'the speaker who is also an accomplished listener "knows when he has correctly echoed a response" and is reinforced thereby' (68); think- ing is 'behaving which automatically affects the behaver and is reinforcing be- cause it does so' (438; cutting one's finger should thus be reinforcing, and an example of thinking); 'the verbal fantasy, whether overt or covert, is automati- cally reinforcing to the speaker as listener. Just as the musician plays or composes what he is reinforced by hearing, or as the artist paints what reinforces him visually, so the speaker engaged in verbal fantasy says what he is reinforced by hearing or writes what he is reinforced by reading' (439); similarly, care in problem solving, and rationalization, are automatically self-reinforcing (442-3). We can also reinforce someone by emitting verbal behavior as such (since this rules out a class of aversive stimulations, 167), by not emitting verbal behavior (keeping silent and paying attention, 199), or by acting appropriately on some future occasion (152: 'the strength of [the speaker's] behavior is determined mainly by the behavior which the listener will exhibit with respect to a given state of affairs'; this Skinner considers the general case of 'communication' or 'letting the listener know'). In most such cases, of course, the speaker is not present at the time when the reinforcement takes place, as when 'the artist... is reinforced by the effects his works have upon ... others' (224), or when the writer is reinforced by the fact that his 'verbal behavior may reach over cen- turies or to thousands of listeners or readers at the same time. The writer may not be reinforced often or immediately, but his net reinforcement may be great' (206; this accounts for the great 'strength' of his behavior). An individual may also find it reinforcing to injure someone by criticism or by bringing bad news, or to publish an experimental result which upsets the theory of a rival (154), to describe circumstances which would be reinforcing if they were to occur (165), to avoid repetition (222), to 'hear' his own name though in fact it was not men- tioned or to hear nonexistent words in his child's babbling (259), to clarify or otherwise intensify the effect of a stimulus which serves an important discrim- inative function (416), etc.
From this sample, it can be seen that the notion of reinforcement has totally lost whatever objective meaning it may ever have had. Running through these examples, we see that a person can be reinforced though he emits no response at all, and that the reinforcing 'stimulus' need not impinge on the 'reinforcedperson'

or need not even exist (it is sufficient that it be imagined or hoped for). When we read that a person plays what music he likes (165), says what he likes (165), thinks what he likes (438-9), reads what books he likes (163), etc., BECAUSE he finds it reinforcing to do so, or that we write books or inform others of facts BECAUSE we are reinforced by what we hope will be the ultimate behavior of reader or listener, we can only conclude that the term 'reinforcement' has a purely ritual function. The phrase 'X is reinforced by Y (stimulus, state of af- fairs, event, etc.)' is being used as a cover term for 'X wants Y', 'X likes Y', 'X wishes that Y were the case', etc. Invoking the term 'reinforcement' has no ex- planatory force, and any idea that this paraphrase introduces any new clarity or objectivity into the description of wishing, liking, etc., is a serious delusion. The only effect is to obscure the important differences among the notions being paraphrased. Once we recognize the latitude with which the term 'reinforcement' is being used, many rather startling comments lose their initial effect-for in- stance, that the behavior of the creative artist is 'controlled entirely by the contingencies of reinforcement' (150). What has been hoped for from the psy- chologist is some indication how the casual and informal description of everyday behavior in the popular vocabulary can be explained or clarified in terms of the notions developed in careful experiment and observation, or perhaps replaced in terms of a better scheme. A mere terminological revision, in which a term borrowed from the laboratory is used with the full vagueness of the ordinary vocabulary, is of no conceivable interest.
It seems that Skinner's claim that all verbal behavior is acquired and main- tained in 'strength' through reinforcement is quite empty, because his notion of reinforcement has no clear content, functioning only as a cover term for any factor, detectable or not, related to acquisition or maintenance of verbal beha- vior.'6 Skinner's use of the term 'conditioning' suffers from a similar difficulty. Pavlovian and operant conditioning are processes about which psychologists have developed real understanding. Instruction of human beings is not. The claim that instruction and imparting of information are simply matters of condi- tioning (357-66) is pointless. The claim is true, if we extend the term 'condition- ing' to cover these processes, but we know no more about them after having revised this term in such a way as to deprive it of its relatively clear and ob- jective character. It is, as far as we know, quite false, if we use 'conditioning' in its literal sense. Similarly, when we say that 'it is the function of predication to facilitate the transfer of response from one term to another or from one object to another' (361), we have said nothing of any significance. In what sense is this true of the predication Whales are mammals?Or, to take Skinner's example, what point is there in saying that the effect of The telephoneis out of orderon the listener is to bring behavior formerly controlled by the stimulus out of order under control of the stimulus telephone(or the telephone itself) by a process of simple conditioning (362)? What laws of conditioning hold in this case? Further-
1* Talk of schedules of reinforcement here is entirely pointless. How are we to decide, for example, according to what schedules covert reinforcement is 'arranged', as in thinking or verbal fantasy, or what the scheduling is of such factors as silence, speech, and ap- propriate future reactions to communicated information?

more, what behavior is 'controlled' by the stimulus out of order,in the abstract? Depending on the object of which this is predicated, the present state of motiva- tion of the listener, etc., the behavior may vary from rage to pleasure, from fixing the object to throwing it out, from simply not using it to trying to use it in the normal way (e.g. to see if it is really out of order), and so on. To speak of 'con- ditioning' or 'bringing previously available behavior under control of a new stimulus' in such a case is just a kind of play-acting at science. Cf. also foot- note 43.
5. The claim that careful arrangement of contingencies of reinforcement by the verbal community is a necessary condition for language learning has ap- peared, in one form or another, in many places.'7Since it is based not on actual observation, but on analogies to laboratory study of lower organisms, it is im- portant to determine the status of the underlying assertion within experimental psychology proper. The most common characterization of reinforcement (one which Skinner explicitly rejects, incidentally) is in terms of drive reduction. This characterization can be given substance by defining drives in some way inde- pendently of what in fact is learned. If a drive is postulated on the basis of the fact that learning takes place, the claim that reinforcement is necessary for learning will again become as empty as it is in the Skinnerian framework. There is an extensive literature on the question of whether there can be learning with- out drive-reduction (latent learning). The 'classical' experiment of Blodgett indicated that rats who had explored a maze without reward showed a marked drop in number of errors (as compared to a control group which had not ex- plored the maze) upon introduction of a food reward, indicating that the rat had learned the structure of the maze without reduction of the hunger drive. Drive-reduction theorists countered with an exploratory drive which was re- duced during the prereward learning, and claimed that a slight decrement in errors could be noted before food reward. A wide variety of experiments, with somewhat conflicting results, have been carried out with a similar design.18 Few investigators still doubt the existence of the phenomenon. Hilgard, in his general review of learning theory,'9 concludes that 'there is no longer any doubt but that, under appropriate circumstances, latent learning is demonstrable.'
More recent work has shown that novelty and variety of stimulus are sufficient
17 See, for example, Miller and Dollard, Social learning and imitation 82-3 (New York, 1941), for a discussion of the 'meticulous training' that they seem to consider necessary for a child to learn the meanings of words and syntactic patterns. The same notion is implicit in Mowrer's speculative account of how language might be acquired, in Learningtheoryand personality dynamics, Chapter 23 (New York, 1950). Actually, the view appears to be quite general.

MacCor- quodale and Meehl, in their contribution to Modernlearning theory,carry out a serious and considered attempt to handle the latent learning material from the standpoint of drive- reduction theory, with (as they point out) not entirely satisfactory results. Thorpe reviews the literature from the standpoint of the ethologist, adding also material on homing and topographical orientation (Learning and instinct in animals [Cambridge, 1956]).

to arouse curiosity in the rat and to motivate it to explore (visually), and in fact, to learn (since on a presentation of two stimuli, one novel, one repeated, the rat will attend to the novel one);20that rats will learn to choose the arm of a single-choice maze that leads to a complex maze, running through this being their only 'reward';21that monkeys can learn object discriminations and maintain their performance at a high level of efficiency with visual exploration (looking out of a window for 30 seconds) as the only reward;22and, perhaps most strikingly of all, that monkeys and apes will solve rather complex manipulation problems that are simply placed in their cages, and will solve discrimination problems with only exploration and manipulation as incentives.23In these cases, solving the problem is apparently its own 'reward'. Results of this kind can be handled by reinforcement theorists only if they are willing to set up curiosity, exploration, and manipulation drives, or to speculate somehow about acquired drives24for which there is no evidence outside of the fact that learning takes place in these cases.

Harlow has been particularly insistent on maintaining the inadequacy of physiologically based drives and homeostatic need states for explaining the persistence of motivation and rapidity of learn- ing in primates. He points out, in many papers, that curiosity, play, exploration, and ma- nipulation are, for primates, often more potent drives than hunger and the like, and that they show none of the characteristics of acquired drives. Hebb also presents behavioral and supporting neurological evidence in support of the view that in higher animals there is a positive attraction in work, risk, puzzle, intellectual activity, mild fear and frustration, etc. (Drives and the CNS, Psych. rev. 62.243-54 [1955]).He concludes that 'we need not work out tortuous and improbableways to explain why men work for money, why children learn without pain, why people dislike doing nothing.'
In a brief note (Early recognition of the manipulative drive in monkeys, British journal of animal behaviour3.71-2 [1955]),W. Dennis calls attention to the fact that early investi- gators (Romanes, 1882; Thorndike, 1901), whose 'perception was relatively unaffected by learning theory, did note the intrinsically motivated behavior of monkeys', although, he asserts, no similar observations on monkeys have been made until Harlow's experiments. He quotes Romanes (Animal intelligence [1882])as saying that 'much the most striking fea- ture in the psychology of this animal, and the one which is least like anything met with in other animals, was the tireless spirit of investigation.' Analogous developments, in which genuine discoveries have blinded systematic investigators to the important insights of earlier work, are easily found within recent structural linguistics as well.
24 ThusJ.S.Brown,incommentingonapaperofHarlow'sinCurrenttheoryandresearch in motivation (Lincoln, 1953), argues that 'in probably every instance [of the experiments cited by Harlow] an ingenious drive-reduction theorist could find some fragment of fear, insecurity, frustration, or whatever, that he could insist was reduced and hence was rein- forcing' (53). The same sort of thing could be said for the ingenious phlogiston or ether theorist.

There is a variety of other kinds of evidence that has been offered to challenge the view that drive-reduction is necessary for learning. Results on sensory- sensory conditioning have been interpreted as demonstrating learning without drive-reduction.25Olds has reported reinforcement by direct stimulation of the brain, from which he concludes that reward need not satisfy a physiological need or withdraw a drive stimulus.26The phenomenon of imprinting, long observed by zoologists, is of particular interest in this connection. Some of the most complex patterns of behavior of birds, in particular, are directed towards objects and animals of the type to which they have been exposed at certain critical early periods of life.27Imprinting is the most striking evidence for the innate disposi- tion of the animal to learn in a certain direction, and to react appropriately to patterns and objects of certain restricted types, often only long after the original learning has taken place. It is, consequently, unrewarded learning, though the resulting patterns of behavior may be refined through reinforcement. Acquisition of the typical songs of song birds is, in some cases, a type of imprinting. Thorpe
reports studies that show 'that some characteristics of the normal song have been learnt in the earliest youth, before the bird itself is able to produce any kind of full song'.28The phenomenon of imprinting has recently been investi- gated under laboratory conditions and controls with positive results.29
Phenomena of this general type are certainly familiar from everyday experi- ence. We recognize people and places to which we have given no particular attention. We can look up something in a book and learn it perfectly well with no other motive than to confute reinforcement theory, or out of boredom, or idle curiosity. Everyone engaged in research must have had the experience of working with feverish and prolonged intensity to write a paper which no one else will read or to solve a problem which no one else thinks important and which will bring no conceivable reward-which may only confirm a general opinion that the researcheris wasting his time on irrelevancies. The fact that rats and monkeys do likewise is interesting, and important to show in careful experiment. In fact, studies of behavior of the type mentioned above have an independent and posi- tive significance that far outweighs their incidental importance in bringing into question the claim that learning is impossible without drive-reduction. It is not at all unlikely that insights arising from animal behavior studies with this broadened scope may have the kind of relevance to such complex activities as
verbal behavior that reinforcement theory has, so far, failed to exhibit. In any event, in the light of presently available evidence, it is difficult to see how anyone

can be willing to claim that reinforcement is necessary for learning, if reinforce- ment is taken seriously as something identifiable independently of the resulting change in behavior.
Similarly, it seems quite beyond question that children acquire a good deal of their verbal and nonverbal behavior by casual observation and imitation of adults and other children.30It is simply not true that children can learn language only through 'meticulous care' on the part of adults who shape their verbal repertoire through careful differential reinforcement, though it may be that such care is often the custom in academic families. It is a common observation that a young child of immigrant parents may learn a second language in the streets, from other children, with amazing rapidity, and that his speech may be com- pletely fluent and correct to the last allophone, while the subtleties that become second nature to the child may elude his parents despite high motivation and continued practice. A child may pick up a large part of his vocabulary and 'feel' for sentence structure from television, from reading, from listening to adults, etc. Even a very young child who has not yet acquired a minimal repertoire from which to form new utterances may imitate a word quite well on an early try, with no attempt on the part of his parents to teach it to him. It is also perfectly obvious that, at a later stage, a child will be able to construct and understand utterances which are quite new, and are, at the same time, acceptable sentences in his language. Every time an adult reads a newspaper, he undoubtedly comes upon countless new sentences which are not at all similar, in a simple, physical sense, to any that he has heard before, and which he will recognize as sentences and understand; he will also be able to detect slight distortions or misprints. Talk of 'stimulus generalization' in such a case simply perpetuates the mystery
under a new title. These abilities indicate that there must be fundamental processes at work quite independently of 'feedback' from the environment. I have been able to find no support whatsoever for the doctrine of Skinner and others that slow and careful shaping of verbal behavior through differential re- inforcement is an absolute necessity. If reinforcement theory really requires the
30Of course it is perfectly possible to incorporate this fact within the Skinnerian frame' work. If, for example, a child watches an adult using a comb and then, with no instruction' tries to comb his own hair, we can explain this act by saying that he performs it because he finds it reinforcing to do so, or because of the reinforcement provided by behaving like a person who is 'reinforcing' (cf. 164). Similarly, an automatic explanation is available for any other behavior. It seems strange at first that Skinner pays so little attention to the literature on latent learning and related topics, considering the tremendous reliance that he places on the notion of reinforcement; I have seen no reference to it in his writings. Similarly, Keller and Schoenfeld, in what appears to be the only text written under pre- dominantly Skinnerian influence, Principles of psychology (New York, 1950), dismiss the latent-learning literature in one sentence as 'beside the point', serving only 'to obscure, rather than clarify, a fundamental principle' (the law of effect, 41). However, this neglect is perfectly appropriate in Skinner's case. To the drive-reductionist, or anyone else for whom the notion 'reinforcement' has some substantive meaning, these experiments and observations are important (and often embarrassing). But in the Skinnerian sense of the word, neither these results nor any conceivable others can cast any doubt on the claim that reinforcement is essential for the acquisition and maintenance of behavior. Behavior cer-
tainly has some concomitant circumstances, and whatever they are, we can call them 'reinforcement'.
￼REVIEWS 43
assumption that there be such meticulous care, it seems best to regard this simply as a reductio ad absurdum argument against this approach. It is also not easy to find any basis (or, for that matter, to attach very much content) to the claim that reinforcing contingencies set up by the verbal community are the single factor responsible for maintaining the strength of verbal behavior. The sources of the 'strength' of this behavior are almost a total mystery at present. Reinforcement undoubtedly plays a significant role, but so do a variety of moti- vational factors about which nothing serious is known in the case of human beings.
As far as acquisition of language is concerned, it seems clear that reinforcement, casual observation, and natural inquisitiveness (coupled with a strong tendency to imitate) are important factors, as is the remarkable capacity of the child to generalize, hypothesize, and 'process information' in a variety of very special and apparently highly complex ways which we cannot yet describe or begin to under- stand, and which may be largely innate, or may develop through some sort of learning or through maturation of the nervous system. The manner in which such factors operate and interact in language acquisition is completely unknown. It is clear that what is necessary in such a case is research, not dogmatic and per- fectly arbitrary claims, based on analogies to that small part of the experimental literature in which one happens to be interested.
The pointlessness of these claims becomes clear when we consider the well- known difficulties in determining to what extent inborn structure, maturation, and learning are responsible for the particular form of a skilled or complex per- formance.3'To take just one example,32the gaping response of a nestling thrush is at first released by jarring of the nest, and, at a later stage, by a moving object of specific size, shape, and position relative to the nestling. At this later stage the response is directed towards the part of the stimulus object corresponding to the parent's head, and characterized by a complex configuration of stimuli that can be precisely described. Knowing just this, it would be possible to con- struct a speculative, learning-theoretic account of how this sequence of behavior patterns might have developed through a process of differential reinforcement, and it would no doubt be possible to train rats to do something similar. However, there appears to be good evidence that these responses to fairly complex 'sign stimuli' are genetically determined and mature without learning. Clearly, the possibility cannot be discounted. Consider now the comparable case of a child imitating new words. At an early stage we may find rather gross correspond- ences. At a later stage, we find that repetition is of course far from exact (i.e.
31Tinbergen (op.cit., Chapter VI) reviews some aspects of this problem, discussing the primary role of maturation in the development of many complex motor patterns (e.g. flying, swimming) in lower organisms, and the effect of an 'innate disposition to learn' in certain specific ways and at certain specific times. Cf. also Schiller, Instinctive behavior 265-88, for a discussion of the role of maturing motor patterns in apparently insightful be- havior in the chimpanzee.

it is not mimicry, a fact which itself is interesting), but that it reproduces the highly complex configuration of sound features that constitute the phonological structure of the language in question. Again, we can propose a speculative ac- count of how this result might have been obtained through elaborate arrange- ment of reinforcing contingencies. Here too, however, it is possible that ability to select out of the complex auditory input those features that are phonologically relevant may develop largely independently of reinforcement, through geneti- cally determined maturation. To the extent that this is true, an account of the development and causation of behavior that fails to consider the structure of the organism will provide no understanding of the real processes involved.
It is often argued that experience, rather than innate capacity to handle in-
formation in certain specific ways, must be the factor of overwhelming dom-
inance in determining the specific character of language acquisition, since a
child speaks the language of the group in which he lives. But this is a superficial
argument. As long as we are speculating, we may consider the possibility that
the brain has evolved to the point where, given an input of observed Chinese
sentences, it produces (by an 'induction' of apparently fantastic complexity and
suddenness) the 'rules' of Chinese grammar, and given an input of observed
English sentences, it produces (by, perhaps, exactly the same process of induc-
tion) the rules of English grammar; or that given an observed application of a term to certain instances it automatically predicts the extension to a class of
complexly related instances. If clearly recognized as such, this speculation is neither unreasonable nor fantastic; nor, for that matter, is it beyond the bounds of possible study. There is of course no known neural structure capable of per- forming this task in the specific ways that observation of the resulting behavior might lead us to postulate; but for that matter, the structures capable of ac- counting for even the simplest kinds of learning have similarly defied detection.38
Summarizing this brief discussion, it seems that there is neither empirical evidence nor any known argument to support any SPECIFIC claim about the relative importance of 'feedback' from the environment and the 'independent contribution of the organism' in the process of language acquisition.
6. We now turn to the system that Skinner develops specifically for the de- scription of verbal behavior. Since this system is based on the notions 'stimulus', 'response', and 'reinforcement', we can conclude from the preceding sections that it will be vague and arbitrary. For reasons noted in ?1, however, I think it is important to see in detail how far from the mark any analysis phrased solely in these terms must be and how completely this system fails to account for the facts of verbal behavior.
Consider first the term 'verbal behavior' itself. This is defined as 'behavior
33Cf. Lashley, In search of the engram, Symposium of the Society for Experimental Biology 4.454-82 (1950). Sperry, On the neural basis of the conditioned response, British journal of animal behaviour3.41-4 (1955),argues that to account for the experimental results
of Lashley and others, and for other facts that he cites, it is necessary to assume that
high-level cerebralactivity of the type of insight, expectancy, etc. is involved even in simple
conditioning. He states that 'we still lack today a satisfactory picture of the underlying neural mechanism' of the conditioned response.
￼REVIEWS 45
reinforced through the mediation of other persons' (2). The definition is clearly much too broad. It would include as 'verbal behavior', for example, a rat pressing the bar in a Skinner-box, a child brushing his teeth, a boxer retreating before an opponent, and a mechanic repairing an automobile. Exactly how much of ordinary linguistic behavior is 'verbal' in this sense, however, is something of a question: perhaps, as I have pointed out above, a fairly small fraction of it, if any substantive meaning is assigned to the term 'reinforced'. This definition is subsequently refined by the additional provision that the mediating response of
the reinforcing person (the 'listener') must itself 'have been conditioned precisely in orderto reinforcethe behavior of the speaker' (225, italics his). This still covers the examples given above, if we can assume that the 'reinforcing' behavior of the psychologist, the parent, the opposing boxer, and the paying customer are the result of appropriate training, which is perhaps not unreasonable. A signifi- cant part of the fragment of linguistic behavior covered by the earlier definition will no doubt be excluded by the refinement, however. Suppose, for example, that while crossing the street I hear someone shout Watch out for the car and jump out of the way. It can hardly be proposed that my jumping (the mediating, reinforcing response in Skinner's usage) was conditioned (that is, I was trained to jump) precisely in order to reinforce the behavior of the speaker. Similarly for a wide class of cases. Skinner's assertion that with this refined definition 'we narrow our subject to what is traditionally recognized as the verbal field' (225) appears to be grossly in error.
7. Verbal operants are classified by Skinner in terms of their 'functional' rela- tion to discriminated stimulus, reinforcement, and other verbal responses. A mand is defined as 'a verbal operant in which the response is reinforced by a
characteristic consequence and is therefore under the functional control of rele- vant conditions of deprivation or aversive stimulation' (35). This is meant to include questions, commands, etc. Each of the terms in this definition raises a host of problems. A mand such as Pass the salt is a class of responses. We cannot tell by observing the form of a response whether it belongs to this class (Skinner is very clear about this), but only by identifying the controlling variables. This is generally impossible. Deprivation is defined in the bar-pressing experiment in terms of length of time that the animal has not been fed or permitted to drink. In the present context, however, it is quite a mysterious notion. No attempt is made here to describe a method for determining 'relevant conditions of depriva- tion' independently of the 'controlled' response. It is of no help at all to be told (32) that it can be characterized in terms of the operations of the experimenter. If we define deprivation in terms of elapsed time, then at any moment a person is in countless states of deprivation.34It appears that we must decide that the relevant condition of deprivation was (say) salt-deprivation, on the basis of the fact that the speaker asked for salt (the reinforcing community which 'sets up'
34Furthermore, the motivation of the speaker does not, except in the simplest cases, correspond in intensity to the duration of deprivation. An obvious counter-example is what Hebb has called the 'salted-nut phenomenon' (Organizationof behavior199 [New York,1949]).Thedifficultyisofcourseevenmoreseriouswhenweconsider'deprivations' not related to physiological drives.
￼46 LANGUAGE, VOLUME 35, NUMBER 1 (1959)
the mand is in a similar predicament). In this case, the assertion that a mand is under the control of relevant deprivation is empty, and we are (contrary to Skinner's intention) identifying the response as a mand completely in terms of form. The word 'relevant' in the definition above conceals some rather serious complications.
In the case of the mand Pass thesalt, the word 'deprivation' is not out of place, though it appears to be of little use for functional analysis. Suppose however that thespeakersaysGivemethebook,Takemeforaride,orLetmefix it.What kinds of deprivation can be associated with these mands? How do we determine or measure the relevant deprivation? I think we must conclude in this case, as before, either that the notion 'deprivation' is relevant at most to a minute frag- ment of verbal behavior, or else that the statement 'X is under Y-deprivation' is just an odd paraphrase for 'X wants Y', bearing a misleading and unjustifiable connotation of objectivity.
The notion 'aversive control' is just as confused. This is intended to cover threats, beating, and the like (33). The manner in which aversive stimulation functions is simply described. If a speaker has had a history of appropriate re- inforcement (e.g. if a certain response was followed by 'cessation of the threat of such injury-of events which have previously been followed by such injury and which are therefore conditioned aversive stimuli') then he will tend to give the proper response when the threat which had previously been followed by the injury is presented. It would appear to follow from this description that a speaker will not respond properly to the mand Your money or your life (38) unless he has a past history of being killed. But even if the difficulties in describing the mechanism of aversive control are somehow removed by a more careful analysis, it will be of little use for identifying operants for reasons similar to those men- tioned in the case of deprivation.
It seems, then, that in Skinner's terms there is in most cases no way to decide whether a given response is an instance of a particular mand. Hence it is meaning- less, within the terms of his system, to speak of the characteristicconsequences of a mand, as in the definition above. Furthermore, even if we extend the system so that mands can somehow be identified, we will have to face the obvious fact that most of us are not fortunate enough to have our requests, commands, advice, and so on characteristically reinforced (they may nevertheless exist in considerable 'strength'). These responses could therefore not be considered mands by Skinner. In fact, Skinner sets up a category of 'magical mands' (48-9) to cover the case of 'mands which cannot be accounted for by showing that they have ever had the effect specified or any similar effect upon similar occasions' (the word 'ever' in this statement should be replaced by 'characteristically'). In these pseudo mands, 'the speaker simply describes the reinforcement appro- priate to a given state of deprivation or aversive stimulation'. In other words, given the meaning that we have been led to assign to 'reinforcement' and 'depri- vation', the speaker asks for what he wants. The remark that 'a speaker appears to create new mands on the analogy of old ones' is also not very helpful.
Skinner's claim that his new descriptive system is superior to the traditional one 'because its terms can be defined with respect to experimental operations'

(45) is, we see once again, an illusion. The statement 'X wants Y' is not clarified by pointing out a relation between rate of bar-pressing and hours of food-depri- vation; replacing 'X wants Y' by 'X is deprived of Y' adds no new objectivity to the description of behavior. His further claim for the superiority of the new analysis of mands is that it provides an objective basis for the traditional classi- fication into requests, commands, etc. (38-41). The traditional classification is in terms of the intention of the speaker. But intention, Skinner holds, can be reduced to contingencies of reinforcement, and, correspondingly, we can explain the traditional classification in terms of the reinforcing behavior of the listener. Thus a question is a mand which 'specifies verbal action, and the behavior of the listener permits us to classify it as a request, a command, or a prayer' (39). It is a request if 'the listener is independently motivated to reinforce the speaker'; a command if 'the listener's behavior is ... reinforced by reducing a threat'; a prayer if the mand 'promotes reinforcement by generating an emotional disposi- tion'. The mand is advice if the listener is positively reinforced by the conse- quences of mediating the reinforcement of the speaker; it is a warning if 'by carrying out the behavior specified by the speaker the listener escapes from aversive stimulation'; and so on. All this is obviously wrong if Skinner is using the words 'request', 'command', etc., in anything like the sense of the corre- sponding English words. The word 'question' does not cover commands. Please pass the salt is a request (but not a question), whether or not the listener happens to be motivated to fulfill it; not everyone to whom a request is addressed is favorably disposed. A response does not cease to be a command if it is not fol- lowed; nor does a question become a command if the speaker answers it because of an implied or imagined threat. Not all advice is good advice, and a response does not cease to be advice if it is not followed. Similarly, a warning may be misguided; heeding it may cause aversive stimulation, and ignoring it might be positively reinforcing. In short, the entire classification is beside the point. A moment's thought is sufficient to demonstrate the impossibility of distinguishing between requests, commands, advice, etc., on the basis of the behavior or dis- position of the particular listener. Nor can we do this on the basis of the typical behavior of all listeners. Some advice is never taken, is always bad, etc., and similarly with other kinds of mands. Skinner's evident satisfaction with this analysis of the traditional classification is extremely puzzling.
8. Mands are operants with no specified relation to a prior stimulus. A tact, on the other hand, is defined as 'a verbal operant in which a response of given form is evoked (or at least strengthened) by a particular object or event or property of an object or event' (81). The examples quoted in the discussion of stimulus control (?3) are all tacts. The obscurity of the notion 'stimulus control' makes the concept of the tact rather mystical. Since, however, the tact is 'the most important of verbal operants', it is important to investigate the develop- ment of this concept in more detail.
We first ask why the verbal community 'sets up' tacts in the child-that is, how the parent is reinforced by setting up the tact. The basic explanation for this behavior of the parent (85-6) is the reinforcement he obtains by the fact that his contact with the environment is extended; to use Skinner's example, the
￼48 LANGUAGEV,OLUME35,NUMBER1(1959)
child may later be able to call him to the telephone. (It is difficult to see, then, how first children acquire tacts, since the parent does not have the appropriate history of reinforcement). Reasoning in the same way, we may conclude that the parent induces the child to walk so that he can make some money delivering newspapers. Similarly, the parent sets up an 'echoic repertoire' (e.g. a phonemic system) in the child because this makes it easier to teach him new vocabulary, and extending the child's vocabulary is ultimately useful to the parent. 'In all these cases we explain the behavior of the reinforcing listener by pointing to an improvement in the possibility of controlling the speaker whom he reinforces' (56). Perhaps this provides the explanation for the behavior of the parent in inducing the child to walk: the parent is reinforced by the improvement in his control of the child when the child's mobility increases. Underlying these modes of explanation is a curious view that it is somehow more scientific to attribute to a parent a desire to control the child or enhance his own possibilities for action than a desire to see the child develop and extend his capacities. Needless to say, no evidence is offered to support this contention.
Consider now the problem of explaining the response of the listener to a tact. Suppose, for example, that B hears A say fox and reacts appropriately, looks around, runs away, aims his rifle, etc. How can we explain B's behavior? Skinner rightly rejects analyses of this offered by Watson and Bertrand Russell. His own equally inadequate analysis proceeds as follows (87-8). We assume (1) 'that in the history of [B] the stimulus fox has been an occasion upon which looking around has been followed by seeing a fox' and (2) 'that the listener has some current "interest in seeing foxes"-that behavior which depends upon a seen fox for its execution is strong, and that the stimulus supplied by a fox is therefore reinforcing'. B carries out the appropriate behavior, then, because 'the heard stimulus fox is the occasion upon which turning and looking about is frequently followed by the reinforcement of seeing a fox'; i.e. his behavior is a discriminated operant. This explanation is unconvincing. B may never have seen a fox and may have no current interest in seeing one, and yet may react appropriately to the stimulus fox.35 Since exactly the same behavior may take place when neither of the assumptions is fulfilled, some other mechanism must be operative here.
Skinner remarks several times that his analysis of the tact in terms of stimulus control is an improvement over the traditional formulations in terms of reference and meaning. This is simply not true. His analysis is fundamentally the same as the traditional one, though much less carefully phrased. In particular, it differs only by indiscriminate paraphrase of such notions as denotation (reference) and connotation (meaning), which have been kept clearly apart in traditional formulations, in terms of the vague concept 'stimulus control'. In one tradi- tional formulation a descriptive term is said to denote a set of entities and to connote or designate a certain property or condition that an entity must possess
35Just as he may have the appropriate reaction, both emotional and behavioral, to such utterances as The volcano is erupting or There's a homicidal maniac in the next room without any previous pairing of the verbal and the physical stimulus. Skinner's discussion of Pav- lovian conditioning in language (154) is similarly unconvincing.

or fulfil if the term is to apply to it.36Thus the term vertebraterefers to (denotes, is true of) vertebrates and connotes the property 'having a spine' or something of the sort. This connoted defining property is called the meaning of the term. Two terms may have the same reference but different meanings. Thus it is ap- parently true that the creatures with hearts are all and only the vertebrates. If so, then the term creaturewith a heartrefers to vertebrates and designates the property 'having a heart'. This is presumably a different property (a different general condition) from having a spine; hence the terms vertebrateand creature with a heart are said to have different meanings. This analysis is not incorrect (for at least one sense of meaning), but its many limitations have frequently been pointed out.37The major problem is that there is no good way to decide whether two descriptive terms designate the same property.38As we have just seen, it is not sufficient that they refer to the same objects. Vertebrateand creaturewith a spine would be said to designate the same property (distinct from that designated by creaturewith a heart). If we ask why this is so, the only answer appears to be that the terms are synonymous. The notion 'property' thus seems somehow
36 Mill, A system of logic (1843). Carnap gives a recent reformulation in Meaning and synonymy in natural languages, Phil. studies 6.33-47 (1955), defining the meaning (inten- sion) of a predicate 'Q' for a speaker X as 'the general condition which an object y must fulfill in order for X to be willing to ascribe the predicate "Q" to y'. The connotation of an expression is often said to constitute its 'cognitive meaning' as opposed to its 'emotive meaning', which is, essentially, the emotional reaction to the expression.
Whether or not this is the best way to approach meaning, it is clear that denotation, cognitive meaning,and emotive meaning are quite differentthings. The differencesare often obscured in empirical studies of meaning, with much consequent confusion. Thus Osgood has set himself the task of accounting for the fact that a stimulus comes to be a sign for another stimulus (a buzzer becomes a sign for food, a word for a thing, etc.). This is clearly (for linguistic signs) a problem of denotation. The method that he actually develops for quantifying and measuring meaning (cf. Osgood, Suci, Tannenbaum, The measurementof meaning [Urbana, 19571)applies, however, only to emotive meaning. Suppose, for example, that A hates both Hitler and science intensely, and considers both highly potent and 'active', while B, agreeing with A about Hitler, likes science very much, although he con- siders it rather ineffective and not too important. Then A may assign to 'Hitler' and 'sci- ence' the same position on the semantic differential, while B will assign 'Hitler' the same position as A did, but 'science' a totally different position. Yet A does not think that 'Hit- ler' and 'science' are synonymous or that they have the same reference, and A and B may agree precisely on the cognitive meaning of 'science'. Clearly it is the attitude toward the things (the emotive meaning of the words) that is being measured here. There is a gradual shift in Osgood's account from denotation to cognitive meaning to emotive meaning. The confusion is caused, no doubt, by the fact that the term 'meaning'is used in all three senses (and others). [See Carroll's review of the book by Osgood, Suci, and Tannenbaum in this number of LANGUAGE.]

Carnap (op.cit.) presents a very similar idea (?6), but somewhat misleadingly phrased, since he does not bring out the fact that only extensional (referential) notions are being used.

language-bound, and appeal to 'defining properties' sheds little light on questions of meaning and synonymy.
Skinner accepts the traditional account in toto, as can be seen from his defini- tion of a tact as a response under control of a property (stimulus) of some physi- cal object or event. We have found that the notion 'control' has no real sub- stance, and is perhaps best understood as a paraphrase of 'denote' or 'connote' or, ambiguously, both. The only consequence of adopting the new term 'stimulus control' is that the important differences between reference and meaning are obscured. It provides no new objectivity. The stimulus controlling the response is determined by the response itself; there is no independent and objective method of identification (see ?3 above). Consequently, when Skinner defines 'synonymy' as the case in which 'the same stimulus leads to quite different re- sponses' (118), we can have no objection. The responses chair and red made alternatively to the same object are not synonymous, because the stimuli are called different. The responses vertebrateand creaturewith a spine would be con- sidered synonymous because they are controlled by the same property of the object under investigation; in more traditional and no less scientific terms, they evoke the same concept. Similarly, when metaphorical extension is ex- plained as due to 'the control exercised by properties of the stimulus which, though present at reinforcement, do not enter into the contingency respected by the verbal community' (92; traditionally, accidental properties), no objection can be raised which has not already been levelled against the traditional account. Just as we could 'explain' the response Mozart to a piece of music in terms of subtle properties of the controlling stimuli, we can, with equal facility, explain the appearance of the response sun when no sun is present, as in Juliet is [like] the sun. 'We do so by noting that Juliet and the sun have common properties, at least in their effect on the speaker' (93). Since any two objects have indefinitely many properties in common, we can be certain that we will never be at a loss to explain a response of the form A is like B, for arbitrary A and B. It is clear, however, that Skinner's recurrent claim that his formulation is simpler and more scientific than the traditional account has no basis in fact.
Tacts under the control of private stimuli (Bloomfield's 'displaced speech') form a large and important class (130-46), including not only such responses as familiar and beautiful, but also verbal responses referring to past, potential, or future events or behavior. For example, the response There was an elephant at the zoo 'must be understood as a response to current stimuli, including events within the speaker himself' (143).39 If we now ask ourselves what proportion of
39In general, the examples discussed here are badly handled, and the success of the proposed analyses is overstated. In each case, it is easy to see that the proposed analysis, which usually has an air of objectivity, is not equivalent to the analyzed expression. To take just one example, the response I am looking for my glasses is certainly not equivalent to the proposed paraphrases: 'When I have behaved in this way in the past, I have found my glasses and have then stopped behaving in this way', or 'Circumstances have arisen in which I am inclined to emit any behavior which in the past has led to the discovery of my glasses; such behavior includes the behavior of looking in which I am now engaged.' One may look for one's glasses for the first time; or one may emit the same behavior in

the tacts in actual life are responses to (descriptions of) actual current outside stimulation, we can see just how large a role must be attributed to private stimuli. A minute amount of verbal behavior, outside the nursery, consists of such remarks as This is red and Thereis a man. The fact that 'functional analysis' must make such a heavy appeal to obscure internal stimuli is again a measure of its actual advance over traditional formulations.
9. Responses under the control of prior verbal stimuli are considered under a different heading from the tact. An echoicoperantis a response which 'generates a sound pattern similar to that of the stimulus' (55). It covers only cases of immediate imitation.40No attempt is made to define the sense in which a child's echoic response is 'similar' to the stimulus spoken in the father's bass voice; it seems, though there are no clear statements about this, that Skinner would not accept the account of the phonologist in this respect, but nothing else is offered. The development of an echoic repertoire is attributed completely to differential reinforcement. Since the speaker will do no more, according to Skinner, than what is demanded of him by the verbal community, the degree of accuracy in- sisted on by this community will determine the elements of the repertoire, whatever these may be (not necessarily phonemes). 'In a verbal community which does not insist on a precise correspondence, an echoic repertoire may re- main slack and will be less successfully applied to novel patterns'. There is no discussion of such familiar phenomena as the accuracy with which a child will pick up a second language or a local dialect in the course of playing with other children, which seem sharply in conflict with these assertions. No anthropologi- cal evidence is cited to support the claim that an effective phonemic system does not develop (this is the substance of the quoted remark) in communities that do not insist on precise correspondence.
A verbal response to a written stimulus (reading) is called 'textual behavior'.
looking for one's glasses as in looking for one's watch, in which case I am looking for my glasses and I am looking for my watch are equivalent, under the Skinnerian paraphrase. The difficult questions of purposiveness cannot be handled in this superficial manner.
40 Skinner takes great pains, however, to deny the existence in human beings (or parrots) of any innate faculty or tendency to imitate. His only argument is that no one would suggest an innate tendency to read, yet reading and echoic behavior have similar 'dynamic proper- ties'. This similarity, however, simply indicates the grossness of his descriptive categories.
In the case of parrots, Skinner claims that they have no instinctive capacity to imitate, but only to be reinforced by successful imitation (59). Given Skinner's use of the word 'reinforcement', it is difficult to perceive any distinction here, since exactly the same thing could be said of any other instinctive behavior. For example, where another scientist would say that a certain bird instinctively builds a nest in a certain way, we could say in Skin- ner's terminology (equivalently) that the bird is instinctively reinforced by building the nest in this way. One is therefore inclined to dismiss this claim as another ritual introduction of the word 'reinforce'. Though there may, under some suitable clarification, be some truth in it, it is difficult to see how many of the cases reported by competent observers can be handled if 'reinforcement' is given some substantive meaning. Cf. Thorpe, op.cit. 353 f.; Lorenz, King Solomon's ring 85-8 (New York, 1952); even Mowrer, who tries to show how imitation might develop through secondary reinforcement, cites a case, op.cit. 694, which he apparently believes, but where this could hardly be true. In young children, it seems
most implausible to explain imitation in terms of secondary reinforcement.
￼52 LANGUAGE, VOLUME 35, NUMBER 1 (1959)
Other verbal responses to verbal stimuli are called 'intraverbal operants'. Paradigm instances are the response four to the stimulus two plus two or the response Paris to the stimulus capital of France. Simple conditioning may be suf- ficient to account for the response four to two plus two,41but the notion of intra- verbal response loses all meaning when we find it extended to cover most of the facts of history and many of the facts of science (72, 129); all word association and 'flight of ideas' (73-6); all translations and paraphrase (77); reports of things seen, heard, or remembered (315); and, in general, large segments of scientific, mathematical, and literary discourse. Obviously the kind of explanation that might be proposed for a student's ability to respond with Paris to capital of France, after suitable practice, can hardly be seriously offered to account for his ability to make a judicious guess in answering the questions (to him new) What is the seat of the French government?,... the source of the literary dialect?, ... the chief targetof the Germanblitzkrieg?,etc., or his ability to prove a new theorem, translate a new passage, or paraphrase a remark for the first time or in a new way.
The process of 'getting someone to see a point', to see something your way, or to understand a complex state of affairs (e.g. a difficult political situation or a mathematical proof) is, for Skinner, simply a matter of increasing the strength of the listener's already available behavior.42Since 'the process is often exemplified by relatively intellectual scientific or philosophical discourse', Skinner considers it 'all the more surprising that it may be reduced to echoic, textual, or intraverbal supplementation' (269). Again, it is only the vagueness and latitude with which the notions 'strength' and 'intraverbal response' are used that save this from absurdity. If we use these terms in their literal sense, it is clear that understand- ing a statement cannot be equated to shouting it frequently in a high-pitched voice (high response strength), and a clever and convincing argument cannot be accounted for on the basis of a history of pairings of verbal responses.43
41Though even this possibility is limited. If we were to take these paradigm instances seriously, it should follow that a child who knows how to count from one to 100could learn an arbitrary 10 X 10 matrix with these numbers as entries as readily as the multiplication table.
42 Similarly,'theuniversalityofaliteraryworkreferstothenumberofpotentialreaders inclined to say the same thing' (275;i.e. the most 'universal' work is a dictionary of cliches and greetings); a speaker is 'stimulating' if he says what we are about to say ourselves (272); etc.
43Similarly, consider Skinner's contention (362-5) that communication of knowledge or facts is just the process of making a new response available to the speaker. Here the anal- ogy to animal experiments is particularly weak. When we train a rat to carry out some peculiar act, it makes sense to consider this a matter of adding a response to his repertoire. In the case of human communication, however, it is very difficult to attach any meaning to this terminology. If A imparts to B the information (new to B) that the railroads face col- lapse, in what sense can the response Therailroadsface collapsebe said to be now, but not previously, available to B? Surely B could have said it before (not knowing whether it was true), and known that it was a sentence (as opposed to Collapseface railroads the). Nor is there any reason to assume that the response has increased in strength, whatever this means exactly (e.g. B may have no interest in the fact, or he may want it suppressed). It is not clear how we can characterize this notion of 'making a response available' without reducing Skinner's account of 'imparting knowledge' to a triviality.

10. A final class of operants, called autoclitics, includes those that are involved in assertion, negation, quantification, qualification of responses, construction of sentences, and the 'highly complex manipulations of verbal thinking'. All these acts are to be explained 'in terms of behavior which is evoked by or acts upon other behavior of the speaker' (313). Autoclitics are, then, responses to already given responses, or rather, as we find in reading through this section, they are responses to covert or incipient or potential verbal behavior. Among the auto- clitics are listed such expressions as I recall, I imagine, for example, assume, let X equal ..., the terms of negation, the is of predication and assertion, all, some, if, then, and, in general, all morphemes other than nouns, verbs, and adjectives, as well as grammatical processes of ordering and arrangement. Hardly a remark in this section can be accepted without serious qualification. To take just one example, consider Skinner's account of the autoclitic all in All swans are white (329). Obviously we cannot assume that this is a tact to all swans as stimulus. It is suggested, therefore, that we take all to be an autoclitic modify- ing the whole sentence Swans are white. All can then be taken as equivalent to always, or always it is possible to say. Notice, however, that the modified sentence Swans are white is just as general as All swans are white. Furthermore, the pro- posed translation of all is incorrect if taken literally. It is just as possible to say Swans are green as to say Swans are white. It is not always possible to say either (e.g. while you are saying something else or sleeping). Probably what Skinner means is that the sentence can be paraphrased 'X is white is true, for each swan X'. But this paraphrase cannot be given within his system, which has no place for true.
Skinner's account of grammar and syntax as autoclitic processes (Chapter 13) differs from a familiar traditional account mainly in the use of the pseudoscientific terms 'control' or 'evoke' in place of the traditional 'refer'. Thus in The boy runs,
the final s of runs is a tact under control of such 'subtle properties of a situation' as 'the nature of running as an activity rather than an object or property of an object'.44 (Presumably, then, in The attemptfails, The difficulty remains, His anxiety increases, etc., we must also say that the s indicates that the object described as the attempt is carrying out the activity of failing, etc.) In the boy's gun, however, the s denotes possession (as, presumably, in the boy's arrival,... story, ... age, etc.) and is under the control of this 'relational aspect of the situation' (336). The 'relational autoclitic of order' (whatever it may mean to call the order of a set of responses a response to them) in The boy runs the store is under the control of an 'extremely complex stimulus situation', namely, that the boy is running the store (335). And in thehat and theshoeis under the control of the property 'pair'. Throughin the dog went throughthe hedgeis under the con- trol of the 'relation between the going dog and the hedge' (342). In general, nouns are evoked by objects, verbs by actions, and so on.
Skinner considers a sentence to be a set of key responses (nouns, verbs, ad- jectives) on a skeletal frame (346). If we are concerned with the fact that Sam

rented a leaky boat, the raw responses to the situation are rent, boat, leak, and Sam. Autoclitics (including order) which qualify these responses, express rela- tions between them, and the like, are then added by a process called 'composi- tion' and the result is a grammatical sentence, one of many alternatives among which selection is rather arbitrary. The idea that sentences consist of lexical items placed in a grammatical frame is of course a traditional one, within both philosophy and linguistics. Skinner adds to it only the very implausible specula- tion that in the internal process of composition, the nouns, verbs, and adjectives are chosen first and then are arranged, qualified, etc., by autoclitic responses to these internal activities.45
This view of sentence structure, whether phrased in terms of autoclitics, syncategorematic expressions, or grammatical and lexical morphemes, is in- adequate. Sheep providewool has no (physical) frame at all, but no other arrange- ment of these words is an English sentence. The sequences furiously sleep ideas green colorless and friendly young dogs seem harmless have the same frames, but only one is a sentence of English (similarly, only one of the sequences formed by reading these from back to front). Struggling artists can be a nuisance has the same frame as marking papers can be a nuisance, but is quite different in sentence structure, as can be seen by replacing can be by is or are in both cases. There are many other similar and equally simple examples. It is evident that more is involved in sentence structure than insertion of lexical items in grammatical frames; no approach to language that fails to take these deeper processes into account can possibly achieve much success in accounting for actual linguistic behavior.
11. The preceding discussion covers all the major notions that Skinner intro-
duces in his descriptive system. My purpose in discussing the concepts one by one was to show that in each case, if we take his terms in their literal meaning, the description covers almost no aspect of verbal behavior, and if we take them metaphorically, the description offers no improvement over various traditional formulations. The terms borrowed from experimental psychology simply lose their objective meaning with this extension, and take over the full vagueness of ordinary language. Since Skinner limits himself to such a small set of terms for paraphrase, many important distinctions are obscured. I think that this analysis supports the view expressed in ?1 above, that elimination of the independent contribution of the speaker and learner (a result which Skinner considers of great importance, cf. 311-2) can be achieved only at the cost of eliminating all significance from the descriptive system, which then operates at a level so gross and crude that no answers are suggested to the most elementary questions.46
46 One might just as well argue that exactly the opposite is true. The study of hesitation pauses has shown that these tend to occur before the large categories-noun, verb, adjec- tive; this finding is usually described by the statement that the pauses occur where there is maximum uncertainty or information. Insofar as hesitation indicates on-going composi- tion (if it does at all), it would appear that the 'key responses' are chosen only after the 'grammatical frame'. Cf. C. E. Osgood, unpublished paper; Goldman-Eisler, Speech analy- sis and mental processes, Language and speech 1.67 (1958).

￼REVIEWS 55
The questions to which Skinner has addressed his speculations are hopelessly premature. It is futile to inquire into the causation of verbal behavior until much more is known about the specific character of this behavior; and there is little point in speculating about the process of acquisition without much better understanding of what is acquired.
Anyone who seriously approaches the study of linguistic behavior, whether linguist, psychologist, or philosopher, must quickly become aware of the enor- mous difficulty of stating a problem which will define the area of his investiga- tions, and which will not be either completely trivial or hopelessly beyond the range of present-day understanding and technique. In selecting functional analysis as his problem, Skinner has set himself a task of the latter type. In an extremely interesting and insightful paper,47K. S. Lashley has implicitly delimited a class of problems which can be approached in a fruitful way by the linguist and psychologist, and which are clearly preliminary to those with which Skinner is concerned. Lashley recognizes, as anyone must who seriously con- siders the data, that the composition and production of an utterance is not simply a matter of stringing together a sequence of responses under the control of outside stimulation and intraverbal association, and that the syntactic organi- zation of an utterance is not something directly represented in any simple way in the physical structure of the utterance itself. A variety of observations lead him to conclude that syntactic structure is 'a generalized pattern imposed on the specific acts as they occur', and that 'a consideration of the structure of the
sentence and other motor sequences will show ... that there are, behind the overtly expressed sequences, a multiplicity of integrative processes which can only be inferred from the final results of their activity'. He also comments on the great difficulty of determining the 'selective mechanisms' used in the actual construction of a particular utterance.
Although present-day linguistics cannot provide a precise account of these integrative processes, imposed patterns, and selective mechanisms, it can at least set itself the problem of characterizing these completely. It is reasonable to regard the grammar of a language L ideally as a mechanism that provides
what stimuli are in 'control' in a specific case? When are stimuli 'similar'? And so on. (It is not interesting to be told e.g. that we say Stop to an automobile or billiard ball because they are sufficiently similar to reinforcing people [46].)
The use of unanalyzed notions like 'similar' and 'generalization' is particularly dis- turbing, since it indicates an apparent lack of interest in every significant aspect of the learning or the use of language in new situations. No one has ever doubted that in some sense, language is learned by generalization, or that novel utterances and situations are in some way similar to familiar ones. The only matter of serious interest is the specific 'simi- larity'. Skinner has, apparently, no interest in this. Keller and Schoenfeld (op.cit.) proceed to incorporate these notions (which they identify) into their Skinnerian 'modernobjective psychology' by defining two stimuli to be similar when 'we make the same sort of response to them' (124;but when are responses of the 'same sort'?). They do not seem to notice that this definition converts their 'principle of generalization' (116), under any reasonable in- terpretation of this, into a tautology. It is obvious that such a definition will not be of much help in the study of language learning or construction of new responses in appropriate situations.

an enumeration of the sentences of L in something like the way in which a deduc- tive theory gives an enumeration of a set of theorems. ('Grammar', in this sense of the word, includes phonology.) Furthermore, the theory of language can be regarded as a study of the formal properties of such grammars, and, with a precise enough formulation, this general theory can provide a uniform method for determining, from the process of generation of a given sentence, a structural description which can give a good deal of insight into how this sentence is used and understood. In short, it should be possible to derive from a properly formu- lated grammar a statement of the integrative processes and generalized patterns imposed on the specific acts that constitute an utterance. The rules of a gram- mar of the appropriate form can be subdivided into the two types, optional and obligatory; only the latter must be applied in generating an utterance. The optional rules of the grammar can be viewed, then, as the selective mechanisms involved in the production of a particular utterance. The problem of specifying these integrative processes and selective mechanisms is nontrivial and not be- yond the range of possible investigation. The results of such a study might, as Lashley suggests, be of independent interest for psychology and neurology (and conversely). Although such a study, even if successful, would by no means answer the major problems involved in the investigation of meaning and the causation of behavior, it surely will not be unrelated to these. It is at least possible, fur- thermore, that such notions as 'semantic generalization', to which such heavy appeal is made in all approaches to language in use, conceal complexities and specific structure of inference not far different from those that can be studied and exhibited in the case of syntax, and that consequently the general character of the results of syntactic investigations may be a corrective to oversimplified approaches to the theory of meaning.
The behavior of the speaker, listener, and learner of language constitutes, of course, the actual data for any study of language. The construction of a grammar which enumerates sentences in such a way that a meaningful structural descrip- tion can be determined for each sentence does not in itself provide an account of this actual behavior. It merely characterizes abstractly the ability of one who has mastered the language to distinguish sentences from nonsentences, to understand new sentences (in part), to note certain ambiguities, etc. These are very remarkable abilities. We constantly read and hear new sequences of words, recognize them as sentences, and understand them. It is easy to show that the new events that we accept and understand as sentences are not related to those with which we are familiar by any simple notion of formal (or semantic or sta- tistical) similarity or identity of grammatical frame. Talk of generalization in this case is entirely pointless and empty. It appears that we recognize a new item as a sentence not because it matches some familiar item in any simple way, but because it is generated by the grammar that each individual has somehow and in some form internalized. And we understand a new sentence, in part, because we are somehow capable of determining the process by which this sentence is derived in this grammar.
Suppose that we manage to construct grammars having the properties out- lined above. We can then attempt to describe and study the achievement of the speaker, listener, and learner. The speaker and the listener, we must assume,
￼REVIEWS 57
have already acquired the capacities characterized abstractly by the grammar. The speaker's task is to select a particular compatible set of optional rules. If we know, from grammatical study, what choices are available to him and what conditions of compatibility the choices must meet, we can proceed meaningfully to investigate the factors that lead him to make one or another choice. The listener (or reader) must determine, from an exhibited utterance, what optional rules were chosen in the construction of the utterance. It must be admitted that the ability of a human being to do this far surpasses our present understanding. The child who learns a language has in some sense constructed the grammar for himself on the basis of his observation of sentences and nonsentences (i.e. cor- rections by the verbal community). Study of the actual observed ability of a speaker to distinguish sentences from nonsentences, detect ambiguities, etc., apparently forces us to the conclusion that this grammar is of an extremely com- plex and abstract character, and that the young child has succeeded in carrying out what from the formal point of view, at least, seems to be a remarkable type of theory construction. Furthermore, this task is accomplished in an astonish- ingly short time, to a large extent independently of intelligence, and in a com- parable way by all children. Any theory of learning must cope with these facts.
It is not easy to accept the view that a child is capable of constructing an extremely complex mechanism for generating a set of sentences, some of which he has heard, or that an adult can instantaneously determine whether (and if so, how) a particular item is generated by this mechanism, which has many of the properties of an abstract deductive theory. Yet this appears to be a fair description of the performance of the speaker, listener, and learner. If this is correct, we can predict that a direct attempt to account for the actual behavior of speaker, listener, and learner, not based on a prior understanding of the struc-
ture of grammars, will achieve very limited success. The grammar must be re- garded as a component in the behavior of the speaker and listener which can only be inferred, as Lashley has put it, from the resulting physical acts. The fact that all normal children acquire essentially comparable grammars of great complexity with remarkable rapidity suggests that human beings are somehow specially designed to do this, with data-handling or 'hypothesis-formulating' ability of unknown character and complexity.48The study of linguistic structure
48 There is nothing essentially mysterious about this. Complex innate behavior patterns and innate 'tendencies to learn in specific ways' have been carefully studied in lower or- ganisms. Many psychologists have been inclined to believe that such biological structure will not have an important effect on acquisition of complex behavior in higher organisms, but I have not been able to find any serious justification for this attitude. Some recent studies have stressed the necessity for carefully analyzing the strategies available to the organism, regarded as a complex 'information-processing system' (cf. Bruner, Goodnow, andAustin,Astudyofthinking[NewYork,1956];Newell,Shaw,andSimon,Elementsofa theory of human problem solving, Psych. rev. 65.151-66 [1958]), if anything significant is to be said about the character of human learning. These may be largely innate, or devel- oped by early learning processes about which very little is yet known. (But see Harlow, The formation of learning sets, Psych. rev. 56.51-65 (1949), and many later papers, where strik- ing shifts in the character of learning are shown as a result of early training; also Hebb, Organizationof behavior109ff.) They are undoubtedly quite complex. Cf. Lenneberg, op.cit., and Lees, review of Chomsky's Syntactic structuresin Lg. 33.406f. (1957), for discussion of
the topics mentioned in this section.
￼58 LANGUAGE, VOLUME 35, NUMBER 1 (1959)
may ultimately lead to some significant insights into this matter. At the moment the question cannot be seriously posed, but in principle it may be possible to study the problem of determining what the built-in structure of an information- processing (hypothesis-forming) system must be to enable it to arrive at the grammar of a language from the available data in the available time. At any rate, just as the attempt to eliminate the contribution of the speaker leads to a
'mentalistic' descriptive system that succeeds only in blurring important tradi- tional distinctions, a refusal to study the contribution of the child to language learning permits only a superficial account of language acquisition, with a vast and unanalyzed contribution attributed to a step called 'generalization' which in fact includes just about everything of interest in this process. If the study of language is limited in these ways, it seems inevitable that major aspects of verbal behavior will remain a mystery.
The measurement of meaning. By CHARLESE. OSGOOD,GEORGEJ. SUCI, and PERCYH. TANNENBAUM.Pp. [vii], 342. Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 1957.
ReviewedbyJOHNB.CARROLLH,arvardUniversity
The title of this book provides scant indication of the wide-angle view which the authors have given of a variety of subjects in psycholinguistics and the study of communication processes in both their theoretical and their practical aspects. One can find a little of everything, from pure psychological theory (in the tradi- tion of Clark L. Hull), personality theory, and attitude research, to journalism and advertising. All this is by way of presenting the rationale and the uses of the measuring technique which Osgood has called the semantic differential (here- after SD). Linguists will be most concerned to learn how the authors have dealt with what they call meaning and how the SD can aid in the development of the branch of linguistics which is covered by the widely used and misused term semantics.
Both in the introduction and towards the close of the book (318) the reader is warned that it represents largely a 'progress report'; he is asked therefore to discount the 'tone of assurance not actually felt'. Certainly he cannot but admire the energy and imagination with which the studies described in this volume have been pursued; he will take note of the fact that psychologists here, there, and everywhere have been quick to adopt the SD as a tool of broad usefulness.' But he will ponder. Indeed, the authors predict (320) that he will raise ques- tions-about whether the SD is really a measure of 'meaning', about whether there are really only three main dimensions of the 'semantic space', and about how much the results of SD research can contribute to our understanding of the nature of meaning.

PREFACE
The APA Guidelines for the Undergraduate Psychology Major (hereinafter referred to as the Guidelines) captures a set of optimal expectations for performance at the completion of the baccalau- reate degree by students who major in psychology. The document out- lines 10 goals and suggested learning outcomes that represent reasonable departmental expectations for the undergraduate psychology major across educational contexts. The goals are divided into two major categories:
• Knowledge, skills, and values consistent with the science and application of psychology
• Knowledge, skills, and values consistent with liberal arts education that are further developed in psychology
Although the Guidelines can aid in curriculum design, goal setting, and assessment planning, faculty are encouraged to consider local factors, such as institutional and departmental missions and student characteristics, in their application. In this spirit, broad discussion of the document can facilitate departmental leadership in designing programs distinctively suited to the institution’s mission and students’ needs while attending to good practice benchmarks.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Why Do We Need the APA Guidelines for the Undergraduate Psychology Major?
For some time, there has been widespread concern about the quality of education at all levels in the United States, along with increasing pressure for accountability. Current best practices in
higher education rely on setting clear expectations for student learning, aligning curricula with these expectations, assessing student attainment, and using assessment results to effect changes that promote better stu- dent learning.
It was in this context that the Board of Educational Affairs (BEA) of the American Psychological Association (APA) appointed a task force to describe a set of learning goals and outcomes for student performance at the completion of the baccalaureate degree. The APA Guidelines for the Undergraduate Psychology Major was developed to articulate a common set of outcomes. A baccalaureate degree in psychology should document that students have the ability to think scientifically about behavior, the skills related to the conduct of research, and the values that reflect psychology as both a science and an applied discipline.
Variations in psychology’s academic organization in institutions of higher education across the country make it difficult to achieve consen-
sus on learning goals and outcomes. In some colleges and universities, psychology is part of a school or college comprising the social sciences.
In others, psychology is aligned with the natural sciences, the humani-
ties, or education. In addition to having organizational diversity, psychol- ogy departments differ with respect to programmatic emphases, student characteristics, faculty expertise, and resources. Undergraduate programs vary—as they should—to meet local, state, and regional needs. Despite 1 these differences, the BEA task force developed goals and outcomes that could be applied broadly across diverse educational contexts (e.g., campus-based programs, online instruction) in the context of liberal education at the undergraduate level.
The Guidelines captures a set of optimal expectations for student performance at the completion of the baccalaureate degree. Applying

these to individual departments, faculty must take into account local factors such as institutional and departmental missions and student characteristics. Regardless of department size and resources, the Guidelines presents reasonable overarching goals for the undergraduate psychology curriculum. Toward this end, these guidelines were developed to aid in curriculum design, goal setting, and assessment planning for the psychology major.
In addition to providing guidance about what constitutes a high-quality undergraduate education for majors in psychology, the Guidelines responds to a number of other important related needs:
•
•
•
•
The Guidelines firmly establishes the major as a science and reinforces a common identity within the discipline. Promoting psychology as a science is increasingly important given the enormous breadth of the discipline and the diversity of professional opportunities and psychological perspectives, including new interdisciplinary configurations.
The Guidelines describes a set of learning goals and outcomes for the psychology major. By making the expectations (outcomes) clear, the Guidelines serves as the basis for assessment plans.
Development of the Guidelines is an important step for the disci- pline and a means of contributing to a growing international effort to articulate goals and outcomes for the major. Dissemination and implementation of the Guidelines could also generate research on effective practices in undergraduate education in psychology.
Building on APA’s earlier efforts when approving the National Standards for the Teaching of High School Psychology (APA, 1999) and the revised National Standards for High School Psychology Curricula (APA, 2005), the Guidelines continues APA’s national focus on quality improvement. Completing expectations for appropriate education at the 4-year level adds an important piece of the
overall education and training context in psychology (see Benjamin, 2001).
The Guidelines provides a common set of outcomes that could aid in the development and evaluation of distance-learning courses and programs by promoting expectations for student learning compara- ble to those used in traditional classrooms.

APA GUIDELINES FOR THE UNDERGRADUATE PSYCHOLOGY MAJOR
Assumptions Underlying the Undergraduate Learning Outcomes
The learning goals and outcomes in this document rest on several key assumptions about the psychology major, the dynamic nature of the discipline, the diversity of psychology departments across the United States, and the assessment of performance relative to out- comes. As a framework for understanding the Guidelines, these assump- tions are that the learning goals and outcomes
• encompass the knowledge, skills, and values that are important for students to acquire in an undergraduate major in psychology within the context of a liberal education;
• incorporate the broad theoretical and research bases of psychology;
• reflect the use of a variety of pedagogical models, including service- learning, research and laboratory experiences, online applications, and traditional classroom approaches;
• foster the development of lifelong learning skills and include competencies that will prepare students for entrance into the workforce or acceptance into graduate or professional schools upon receipt of the baccalaureate degree;
• reflect the importance of diversity and cross-cultural issues in the discipline, as well as the growing internationalization of psychology and the need to prepare psychology majors to understand behavior and experience that may transcend geographic boundaries;
• apply to psychology departments across institutional settings that contribute to student achievement at the baccalaureate level;
• reflect the views that any outcome is meaningful only to the extent that it is accurately assessed and that the outcomes assessment process will focus on student performance if it is to improve learning and teaching;
3
￼• allow for many legitimate ways to reach a learning outcome, especially given that outcomes are developmental in nature; individual psychology departments determine the performance levels appropriate for their students and the assessment procedures and tools appropriate to measuring their students’ performance.
APA GUIDELINES FOR THE UNDERGRADUATE PSYCHOLOGY MAJOR
Use of the Term Guidelines
The term guidelines generally refers to pronouncements, statements, or declarations that recommend or suggest specific actions, goals, or endeavors. In this spirit, they are aspirational in intent. They are not intended to be mandatory or exhaustive and may not be applica- ble to every situation, nor are they intended to take precedence over the judgment of college and university faculty.
This use of the term guidelines is consistent with general practices
in the undergraduate education community. A primary consideration related to the nature of the document is the issue of academic freedom. The American Association of University Professors (AAUP) published a seminal paper articulating the principles of academic freedom meant to ensure the fundamental advancement of truth (see AAUP, 2006). Teachers are explicitly granted the right to exercise freedom in their discussions about respective disciplinary matters. Therefore, the Guidelines should be used only as a broad and general framework for
the undergraduate psychology major.
The term guidelines is also consistent with terminology used by other scientific organizations. The American Chemical Society (ACS; 2003) provides guidelines for the undergraduate major in chemistry. Although the ACS guidelines are for the purpose of accreditation, they offer only general curricular goals rather than an exact curriculum. Similarly, the American Physical Society, through the American Association of Physics Teachers (see Hilborn, Howes, &amp; Krane, 2003), provides general guidance for the undergraduate major in their report on the status of the undergraduate major in physics.
Finally, as used in this document, the term guidelines is consistent with the provisions of the APA policy on Developing and Evaluating Standards and Guidelines Related to Education and Training in Psychology
4 (Section I C[1]) (APA, 2004), as passed by the APA Council of Representatives.
Process of Developing the Guidelines
Five reports preceded the development of these guidelines, and many individuals and groups contributed to their initial develop- ment. Study of the curriculum can be traced back to the summer
￼APA GUIDELINES FOR THE UNDERGRADUATE PSYCHOLOGY MAJOR
of 1951 with the issuance of the Cornell Conference Report. This report emphasized psychology as a science grounded in the tradition of the liber- al arts. The report merely suggested that one introductory course should be followed by intermediate core courses (e.g., statistics and perception) and finally by advanced courses (e.g., social psychology and learning). The Michigan Conference Report followed approximately 10 years later, with less consensus about the structure of the undergraduate curriculum. Similarly, the Kulik Report (in 1973) and the Schreirer and Rogers Report (in 1985) provided only descriptive information about the undergraduate major (for more information on these reports, see Brewer et al., 1993). Ultimately, at the St. Mary’s Conference in 1991, Charles Brewer and his committee from the APA National Conference on Enhancing the Quality of Undergraduate Education in Psychology provided a broad structure for the undergraduate curriculum. Defining seven goals for the undergraduate major, Brewer and his colleagues suggested that the curriculum should include an introductory course, methodology courses, subfield content courses, and an integrative experience.
It was in this context, together with the movement in higher education to identify competencies as learning objectives, that the BEA appointed the Task Force on Psychology Major Competencies in 2000 to develop learning goals and outcomes for the undergraduate psycholo- gy major. Members of the task force represented a variety of institutional perspectives on the nature of the undergraduate curriculum and its aims. Under the leadership of Jane S. Halonen (chair), task force members included Drew C. Appleby, Charles L. Brewer, William Buskist, Angela R. Gillem, Diane Halpern, G. William Hill IV, Margaret A. Lloyd, Jerry L. Rudmann, and Valjean M. Whitlow. APA staff who contributed their expertise included Bernard C. Beins, now at Ithaca College, Maureen McCarthy, presently at Kennesaw State University, and Martha Boenau of the APA Education Directorate.
In the early stages of their work, the task force patterned its document after the guidelines developed by the Task Force on Outcomes for the California State University System, led by Mary Allen and Diane Halpern (past president of APA). The task force prepared a document that would serve as a resource to undergraduate psychology departments and faculty to assist with academic review processes and curriculum planning. As described in the Undergraduate Psychology Major Learning Goals and Outcomes (APA, 2002b), the task force identified 10
5
￼APA GUIDELINES FOR THE UNDERGRADUATE PSYCHOLOGY MAJOR
goals and suggested learning outcomes representing reasonable depart- mental expectations for the undergraduate psychology major across educational contexts. The goals were divided into two major categories: (a) knowledge, skills, and values consistent with the science and applica- tion of psychology and (b) knowledge, skills, and values consistent with liberal arts education that are further developed in psychology.
To extend representation to a diverse array of institutions and relevant organizations, the task force assembled an advisory panel to review drafts of the document. Through this process, the document was widely distributed to faculty at research universities, comprehensive universities, 4-year colleges, 2-year colleges, and high schools. Their comments were integrated into the Guidelines. The task force also sought and received helpful feedback from members of related profes- sional organizations with interests in psychology curricula. A final version of this document was endorsed by the BEA in March 2002 and made available to the undergraduate community as a report published on the APA Education Directorate Web site (see APA, 2002b).
By July 2002, the report was disseminated broadly to APA gover- nance groups and APA divisions, with a request for review and feedback. The Guidelines was also reviewed for attention to individual and cultural diversity issues consistent with the Guidelines on Multicultural Education, Research, Practice, and Organizational Change for Psychologists (APA, 2003); in addition, it was reviewed by the APA Committee on Ethnic Minority Affairs and the Committee on Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual Concerns. APA Boards and Committees received a final draft of the document in the spring of 2006. Subsequently, upon recommendation of the APA Board of Directors, the APA Council of Representatives adopted the Guidelines in August 2006.
Resource Documents
6 In developing the Guidelines, the task force reviewed the existing guidelines used by science-based disciplinary societies similar to APA, such as the American Chemical Society, the American
Physical Society (APS), and the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (ASBMB). These guidelines on the undergraduate curriculum were found to be similar in structure to the APA guidelines. For example, ASBMB (see Voet et al., 2003) explicitly stated that it was
￼APA GUIDELINES FOR THE UNDERGRADUATE PSYCHOLOGY MAJOR
no longer recommending a course-based curriculum. Instead, ASBMB provided content and student-outcome-focused guidance. Additional resources included use of the APA Ethical Principles of Psychologists and Code of Conduct (APA, 2002a) and the Handbook for Enhancing Undergraduate Education in Psychology (McGovern, 1993). The content contained in the Guidelines is consistent with APA’s Ethics Code.
Feedback
The Guidelines is a “living document.” Accordingly, APA has established a systematic plan for periodically reviewing and revising such documents to reflect developments in the discipline and in education. Reviews will occur every 7 years, which is consistent with APA Association Rule 30-8.3 requiring cyclical review of approved standards and guidelines within periods not to exceed 10 years. Comments and sug- gestions are welcomed.

￼APA GUIDELINES FOR THE UNDERGRADUATE PSYCHOLOGY MAJOR
APA GUIDELINES FOR THE UNDERGRADUATE PSYCHOLOGY MAJOR
Structure of the Guidelines
The APA Guidelines for the Undergraduate Psychology Major provides details for 10 suggested goals and related learning outcomes for the psychology major, grouped into two major categories.
Categories of Learning Goals and Outcomes
I. Knowledge, Skills, and Values Consistent With the Science and Application of Psychology
This category represents activities that provide hallmarks of psychology education. Responsibility for development in and assessment of these areas rests primarily with the psychology faculty in coursework or psychology advising.
II. Knowledge, Skills, and Values Consistent With Liberal Arts Education That Are Further Developed in Psychology
This category includes activities that are usually part of a general education program or liberal education. Responsibility for student development in these areas and assessment of students’ achievements tend to be shared across a broader range of disciplines than just psychology; however, psy- chology coursework can contribute to and expand upon these general edu- cation goals in significant ways. In turn, well-developed liberal education skills can contribute to student achievement within the psychology major.
Learning Goals
I. Knowledge, Skills, and Values Consistent With the Science and Application of Psychology 9
Goal 1: Knowledge Base of Psychology
Students will demonstrate familiarity with the major concepts, theoretical perspectives, empirical findings, and historical trends in psychology.
Goal 2: Research Methods in Psychology
Students will understand and apply basic research methods in
￼
￼10
psychology, including research design, data analysis, and interpretation.
Goal 3: Critical Thinking Skills in Psychology
Students will respect and use critical and creative thinking, skep- tical inquiry, and, when possible, the scientific approach to solve problems related to behavior and mental processes.
Goal 4: Application of Psychology
Students will understand and apply psychological principles to personal, social, and organizational issues.
Goal 5: Values in Psychology
Students will be able to weigh evidence, tolerate ambiguity, act ethically, and reflect other values that are the underpinnings of psychology as a discipline.
II. Knowledge, Skills, and Values Consistent With Liberal Arts Education That Are Further Developed in Psychology
Goal 6: Information and Technological Literacy
Students will demonstrate information competence and the ability to use computers and other technology for many purposes.
Goal 7: Communication Skills
Students will be able to communicate effectively in a variety of formats.
Goal 8: Sociocultural and International Awareness
Students will recognize, understand, and respect the complexity of sociocultural and international diversity.
Goal 9: Personal Development
Students will develop insight into their own and others’ behavior and mental processes and apply effective strategies for self-management and self-improvement.
Goal 10: Career Planning and Development
Students will emerge from the major with realistic ideas about how to implement their psychological knowledge, skills, and val- ues in occupational pursuits in a variety of settings.
APA GUIDELINES FOR THE UNDERGRADUATE PSYCHOLOGY MAJOR
Learning Outcomes
Each of the 10 goals includes specific, numbered outcomes that articu- late suggested strategies for how the goals can be demonstrated. Each goal can be addressed in departments’ curriculum designs and assess- ment plans; however, departments may choose formally to emphasize selected goals and outcomes depending on their emphases, traditions, or resources. Separate subpoints for particular outcomes provide further assistance in developing performance expectations.
An emphasis on certain content areas included as part of the learning goals and outcomes should not be construed as dictating course require- ments. For example, the emphasis on the development of career skills
does not imply that these activities must transpire in a formal course on careers in psychology. Similarly, the Guidelines should not be interpreted as advocating that separate courses in the history of psychology or group dynamics be included in the undergraduate curriculum. Rather, these guidelines are intended to empower and encourage departments to determine contexts in which students can learn those relevant skills
and perspectives.

iple 8. Client Relationship. The psy- t informs his prospective client of the im- aspects of the potential relationship that affect the client's decision to enter the rela-
Aspects of the relationship likely to affect the client's dccision include the recording of an interview, the use of interview material for training purposes, and observation of an interview by other persons.
When the client is not competent to evaluate tbe
situation (as in the case of a child)' the person ,, reponsible for the client is informed of the circum-
strnces rvhich may influence the relationship.
Xle psychologist does not normally enter into a pro- .fessional relationship with members of his own family, intimate friends, close associates, or others whose velfare might be jeopardized by such a dual relation- ,stip.
9. Impersonal Services. Psycholog- lcrvices for the purpose of diagnosis, treatment, lized advice are provided only in the
of a professional relationship and are not by means of public lectures or demonstra-
newspaper or magazine articles, radio or programs, mail, or similar media.
I]be preparation of personnel reports and recom- Irmdations based on test data secured solely by mail l,b unethical unless such appraisals are an integral part nl a continuing client relationship with a company, $ a result of which the consulting psychologist has c knowledge of the ctent's personnel situation lud can be assured thereby that his written appraisals .iill be adequate to the purpose and will be properly
ed by the client. These reports must not embellished with such detailed analyses of the sub- personality traits as would be appropriate only intensive interviews with the subject. The
nrust not make specific recommendations as tmplolment or placement of the subject which go the psychologist's knou'ledge of the job re-
quirements of the company. The reports must not purport to eliminate the company's need to carry on such other regular employment or personnel practices as appraisal of the work history, ctrecking of refer- ences, past performance in the company.
Principle 10. Announcement of Services. A psychologist adheres to professional rather than commercial standards in making known his avail- ability for professional services.
a. A psychologist does not directly solicit clients for individual diagnosis or therapy.
b. Individual listings in telephone directories are limited to name, highest relevant degree, certifrcation status, address, and telephone number. They may also in- clude identification in a few words of the psychologist's major areas of practice; for example, child tberapy, personnel selection, industrial psychology. Agency listings are equally modest.
c. Announcements of individual private practice are limited to a simple statement of the name, higbest relevant degree, certification or diplomate status, address, telephone number, offrce hours, and a brief explanation of the types of services rendered. An- nouncements of agencies may list names of stafr members with their qualifications. They conform in other particulars with the same standards as in-
dividual announcements, making certain that the true
nature of the organization is apparent.
d. A psychologist or agency announcing noncliuical pro-
fessional services may use brochures that are descrip- tive of services rendered but not evaluative. They may be sent to professional persons, schools, business firms, government agencies, and other similar organiza- tions.
e. The use in a brochure of "testimonials from satisfied users" is unacceptable. The offer of a free trial of services is unacceptable if it operates to misrepresent in any way the nature or the efficacy of the services rendered by the psychologist. Claims that a psy- chologist has unique skills or unique devices not available to others in the profession are made only if the special efficacy of these unique skills or devices has been demonstrated by scientifically acceptable
evidence.
f. The psychologist must not encourage (nor, within his
porver, even allow) a client to bave exaggerated ideas as to the efficacy of services rendered. Claims made to clients about the efficacy of his services must not go beyond those which the psychologist would be willing to subjcct to professional scrutiny through publishing his results and his claims in a professional journal.
Principle 11. Interprofessional Relations. A psychologist acts with integrity in regard to col- leagues in psychology and in other professions.
a. A psychologist does not normally offer professional services to a person rcceiving psychological assistance from anotber professional worker except by agxeement

            <Title>Key concepts</Title>
            <Text>### Overview of the conceptual issues at stake
In many ways, this is not a game about Psychology or Psychiatry, it is a game about the Philosophy of Science. This shouldn't really be surprising, as the history of the Psychology and Psychiatry is intimately linked to the history of the Philosophy of Science. Arguments made by Wundt, Freud, Watson, Hull Skinner and Miller all rely heavily on claims regarding what is or is not a legitimate scientific claim. This issues has not disappeared from undergraduate Psychological classroom either.  The APA's current guidelines for the Undergraduate Major in Psychology, published 2010, lists 10 learning outcomes for a major. The first is:

	&gt; Goal 1: Knowledge Base of Psychology
&gt; Demonstrate familiarity with the major concepts, theoretical perspectives, empirical findings, and historical trends in psychology
	&gt; Suggested Learning Outcomes
  1.1.	Characterize the nature of psychology as a discipline
  a)	Explain why psychology is a science.
  b)	Identify and explain the primary objectives of psychology: describing, understanding, predicting, and controlling behavior and mental processes.
  c)	Compare and contrast the assumptions and methods of psychology with those of other disciplines
  d)	Describe the contributions of psychology perspectives to interdisciplinary collaboration.

If the reader compares (b) to the definitions offered by the various historical figures in the 'Brief History of Psychology' in the gamebook, you will no doubt recognize the theoretical pluralism embodied in that statement.  My main for quoting this document is, however, (a).

The question if psychology is a science is a question of demarcation – the classic issue in the Philosophy of Science.  Answering why psychology is a science assumes a positive answer to the demarcation problem, and hence, a particular view in the Philosophy of Science.  Thus, Wundt charged Hebart with non-scientific investigations into introspection, because they did not adequately control the environment. Watson charged that McDougall's notion of behaviors having a 'purpose' was non-scientific, because they did not follow strict verificationism in the philosophy of science. When Hull charged that Tolman's explanations were unscientific because they positing internal entities, he did so by citing Newton (who, the critic would note, posited 'force', an invisible entity that was criticized at the time as an 'occult' power) (1935). Miller and Chomsky rejected Skinner's arguments by citing Philosophers of Science such as Patrick Suppes, who contend that the history of science shows that scientists do posit internal entities, if they can modeled.

### Textbooks: A
 brief review of introductory textbooks in psychology demonstrates that the current crop of answers here is not good-

### Philosophy of Science
Many of the issues raised in the course of the game are appropriately philosophical.  While we've instructed the students to focus on the evidence, and its relationship with the claims asserted, one is often forced to notice how few of the great conflicts in the history of psychology and psychiatry are actually about the quality of the evidence presented. The conflicts are, most frequently, actually about whether the evidence in question can be considered 'scientific.' 

Some of these issues that will make an appearance in the game are:

	* Is mental illness a disorder of an individual or a society? (i.e. are the entities studied in psychology individual humans or human societies?) -Clark, Albee, Szasz
	* Is medical model an appropriate model for the classification, diagnostic criteria and treatment of mental disorders? Szasz, Albee v. Spitzer
* Related: Should mental disorders be classified in terms of their causes (etiology), or their symptoms? (psychoanalysts v. Spitzer)
	* Are mental health norms defined in terms of statistical frequency of a given behavior in the population, or ideals of human behavior? (Anastasi v. Bieber)
	* Is modeling / abductive reasoning a scientific method, or is science limited to explanations of observable behavior in terms of observable behavior? (cognitivists v. behaviorists)
	* What are the responsibilities of scientists who study humans and human societies for social advocacy? (Chomsky, Skinner, Albee, Clark v. Tyler, Bieber)

            <Text>## Leona Tyler, PhD
### Your Biography
You are Leona Tyler, Psychologist.
You were born in Chetek, Wisconsin in 1906. When you were a child, your family moved to Mesabi Iron Range in Minnesota, where you would live until college.
You originally studied English literature as an undergraduate. You met the applied psychologist D.G. Paterson and started a PhD In Psychology at the University of Minnesota.  In 1940, as ABD, you was appointed the head of the Personnel Research Bureau at the University of Oregon. After WWII, you established a veteran’s counseling service funded by the VA at U Oregon. In 1951-52, you traveled to Maudsley Hospital in England to work with the Psychiatrist Hans Eysenck. And in 1962-63, you held a Fulbright in Amsterdam.

In 1947, building on your experience at the University of Oregon, you published The Psychology of Human Differences. Still a classic of counseling, in it you suggest that the best way to understand individuals in counseling session is to see them as making choices between an infinite array of possible alternatives. You do not have a taste for theoretical bickering. As a counselor, you take a pragmatic approach to theoretical issues, but various commentators have noticed your similarity to theories of Piaget, Carl Rogers, Erik Erikson and others.  Your practice blends psychoanalytic, behavioral and cognitive therapies.

The primary focus of your work is 'individuality,' not in a philosophical or moral sense, but in the sense that you reject the idea that an individual personality can be represented as a profile of scores in an n-dimensional space. On the contrary, you argue that an individual personality can be best described by the series of choices that that individual has made. It is possible, you hypothesize, to identify patterns in choice-making behavior. Your 'Choice Pattern Technique,' which asks people to choose and sort cards representing careers and leisure-time activities, is still widely used by psychological and career counselors today.

In recent years, however, you have come to theorize that in order to make choices, an individual must be able to represent possible courses of actions or states of affairs that are not actual (i.e. possible but not currently real). At times, the internal representations discussed by these new 'Cognitive Scientists' like Chomsky and Miller, sound very similar to your hypothetical structures. But you're not willing to give up the obvious successes of behavioral therapy.

 To understand an individual, then, we must understand both that the individuals' cognitive / representational abilities and their patterns of choosing between possibilities to make them actual.
### Game Objectives
As an initial member of the Research committee, you'll be called upon to judge the scientific legitimacy and ethical acceptability of proposed research programs.  You should make yourself familiar with the sections of the game book titled 'A Primer on Research Methods' and 'Ethics of Human Research'.  Your gamemaster will give you an additional sheet outlining the responsibilities of members of the research committee in evaluating proposals.

Notice that the official documents of the APA, as included in the game book, are written in gender-specific language: I.B states “a nonmember of the APA may read a paper provided that he is sponsored...”. The implication here is, of course, that a female nonmember is not allowed to present. As this document is an official representation of the policies of the APA, it should be clarified to reflect the policies of the organization. You should make those proposals in 1973.

If you become president, it is almost certain that there will be a number of proposed proclamations on the table.  You should insist on the following the 'advocacy' principle. If you can make it policy, so much the better:

&gt;As citizens, members of the APA have the right to advocate for any cause through the myriad of political advocacy organizations, but when psychologists and psychiatrists speak for the profession through APA public stances and proclamations, it should be from science and professional experience.

&gt;On occasion psychiatrists are asked for an opinion about an individual who is in the light of public attention or who has disclosed information about himself/herself through public media. In such circumstances, a psychiatrist may share with the public his or her expertise about psychiatric issues in general. However, it is unethical for a psychiatrist to offer a professional opinion unless he or she has conducted an examination and has been granted proper authorization for such a statement.

You can split these two paragraphs into two proposals, if you believe it will be easier to pass them. The second is a direct result of the Goldwater affair (see the gamebook 'Playing a psychologist or psychiatrist in the 1970s’), and anticipates the problems associated with the APA’s stand on abortion in 1970’s.  You can mine the history of both of these issues for arguments in favor of your proposal. You should also look at Principle 5 of the APA Ethical Standards of Psychologists for support.

You should organize your efforts on these manners with the other women in the organization. As you'll notice from the brief history in the gamebook, the APA had women members since its second year of existence, and Mary Whiton Calkins was a president in its 12th year (1905).  There has not, however, been a women in a leadership position since that time.  You are a serious candidate to be the first woman president in over 50 years.

You are neutral on the issue of the definition of mental illness, so long as it is clearly not gendered in any way.
#### Specific Assignments
You should present a paper introducing your view of counseling and a 'hopeful' psychology (based on your actual 1973 presidential address) whether or not you are elected president. If elected president, this should be your presidential address. If not, you'll have to propose it as a conference paper to the Program committee.

            <Comments>Many of the first-person stories on the 'treatments' of homosexuality that are collected at http://treatmentshomosexuality.org.uk/ come from Maudsley.
In 1964, a magazine called Fact asked 12,000 psychiatrists if they would be willing to diagnose conservative presidential candidate Barry Goldwater. Of the more than 2000 that responded 1,189 responded that he appeared to have a 'personality disorder'--that slippery category between psychosis and neurosis.  The headline proclaimed (under the magazine's title 'fact:') that “1,198 Psychiatrists Say Goldwater Is Psychologically Unfit To Be President! You may recall that the 1964 election witnessed Johnson's famous 'Daisy' ad, which suggested that the election of Barry Goldwater would lead to nuclear annihilation.⁠1  


1 For a brief history see Pinsker, H. (2007). “Goldwater Rule' History”, Psychiatric News, 42 (15), p. 33 (http://pn.psychiatryonline.org/content/42/15/33.1.full)
In 1969, the American Psychological Association issued a public proclamation, citing lack of evidence to the contrary that:
WHEREAS in many state legislature, bills have recently been introduced for the purpose of repealing or drastically modifying the existing criminal codes with respect to the termination of unwanted pregnancies; and whereas, termination of unwanted pregnancies is clearly a mental health and child welfare issue, and a legitimate concern of APA; be it resolved, that termination of pregnancy be considered a civil right of the pregnant woman, to be handled as other medical and surgical procedures in consultation with her physician, and to be considered legal if performed by a licensed physician in a licensed medical facility.⁠1

The American Psychiatric Association followed in 1977 with:
The emotional consequences of unwanted pregnancy on parents and their offspring may lead to long-standing life distress and disability, and the children of unwanted pregnancies are at high risk for abuse, neglect, mental illness, and deprivation of the quality of life. Pregnancy that results from undue coercion, rape, or incest creates even greater potential distress or disability in the child and the parents. The adolescent most vulnerable to early pregnancy is the product of adverse sociocultural conditions involving poverty, discrimination, and family disorganization, and statistics indicate that the resulting pregnancy is laden with medical complications which threaten the well-being of mother and fetus. The delivery that ensues from teenage pregnancy is prone to prematurity and major threats to the health of mother and child, and the resulting newborns have a higher percentage of birth defects, developmental difficulties, and a poorer life and health expectancy than the average for our society. Such children are often not released for adoption and thus get caught in the web of foster care and welfare systems, possibly entering lifetimes of dependency and costly social interventions. The tendency of this pattern to pass from generation to generation is very marked and thus serves to perpetuate a cycle of social and educational failure, mental and physical illness, and serious delinquency.
Because of these considerations, and in the interest of public welfare, the American Psychiatric Association
1)	opposes all constitutional amendments, legislation, and regulations curtailing family planning and abortion services to any segment of the population; 2) reaffirms its position that abortion is a medical procedure in which physicians should respect the patient's right to freedom of choice - psychiatrists may be called on as consultants to the patient or physician in those cases in which the patient or physician requests such consultation to expand mutual appreciation of motivation and consequences; and 3) affirms that the freedom to act to interrupt pregnancy must be considered a mental health imperative with major social and mental health implications.⁠2
You'll recall that the US Supreme court decided that abortion was covered by the constitutional dictate to a 'right to privacy,' thereby blocking all laws that had kept abortion illegal.

Interpersonal dynamics in a prison environment are to be studied experimentally by designing a functional simulation of a prison in which subjects role-pay prisoners and guards for an extended period of time. To assess the power of the social forces on the emergent behavior in this situation, alternative explanations in terms of pre-existing dispositions are to be eliminated through subject selection. A homogeneous, “normal” sample is to be chosen after extensive interviewing and diagnostic testing of a large group of volunteer male college students. Half of the subjects are to be randomly assigned to role-play prison guards for eight hours each day, while the others role-play prisoners incarcerated for nearly one fill week. Neither group will receive any specific training in these roles. The primary investigator will role-play the prison warden, and consultants from the real prison population (both prisoners and prison officials) will be recruited to assist in the planning and implementation of the prison environment. 
Continuous, direct observation of behavioral interactions will be supplemented by video-taped recording, questionnaires, self-report scales and interviews. All these data sources are likely to converge on the conclusion that this simulated prison will develop into a psychologically compelling prison environment.

### Your Biography
You are Robert Spitzer, psychiatrist. You were recently profiled by Alix Spiegel, grandson of John P. Spiegel, for the New Yorker (issue 2005-01-03). It is available online at http://metzelf.info/articles/Spitzer.html
 Allow me to quote excerpts of that article here:
“In the mid-nineteen-forties, Robert Spitzer, a mathematically minded boy of fifteen, began weekly sessions of Reichian psychotherapy. Wilhelm Reich was an Austrian psychoanalyst and a student of Sigmund Freud who, among other things, had marketed a device that he called the orgone accumulator — an iron appliance, the size of a telephone booth, that he claimed could both enhance sexual powers and cure cancer. Spitzer had asked his parents for permission to try Reichian analysis, but his parents had refused—they thought it was a sham—and so he decided to go to the sessions in secret. He paid five dollars a week to a therapist on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, a young man willing to talk frankly about the single most compelling issue Spitzer had yet encountered: women. Spitzer found this methodical approach to the enigma of attraction soothing and invigorating. The real draw of the therapy, however, was that greatly reduced Sptizer's anxieties about his troubled family life: his mother was a “professional patient” who cried continuously, and his father was cold and remote. Spizer, unfortunately, had inherited his mother's unruly inner life and his father's repressed affect; though he often found himself overpowered by emotion, he was somehow unable to express his feelings. The sessions helped him, as he says, “become alive,” and he always looked back on them with fondness. It was this experience that confirmed what would become your guiding principle: the best way to master the wilderness of emotion was through systematic study and analysis.
Robert Spitzer isn't widely known outside the field of mental health, but he is,e without question, one of the most influential psychiatrists of the twentieth century. It was Spitzer who took the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders — the official listing of all mental diseases recognized by the American Psychiatric Association (APA) — and established it as a scientific instrument of enormous power. Because insurance companies now require a DSM diagnosis for reimbursement, the manual is mandatory for any mental-health professional seeking compensation. It’s also used by the court system to help determine insanity, by social-services agencies, schools, prisons, and government, and, occasionally, as a plot device on “The Sopranos”. This magnitude of cultural authority, however, is a relatively recent phenomenon. Although the DSM was first published in 1952 and a second edition (DSM-II) came out in 1968, early versions of the document were largely ignored....
…Spitzer first came to the university as a resident and student at the Columbia Center for Psychoanalytic Training and Research, after graduating from N.Y.U School of Medicine in 1957. He had a brilliant medical-school career, publishing in professional journals a series of well-received papers about childhood schizophrenia and reading disabilities. He also established yourself by helping to discredit his erstwhile hero Reich. In addition to his weekly sessions on the Lower East Side,  the teen-age Spitzer had persuaded another Reichian doctor to give him free access to an orgone accumulator, and he spent many hours sitting hopefully on the booth’s tiny stool, absorbing healing orgone energy, to no obvious avail. In time, he became disillusioned, and in college he wrote a paper critical of the therapy, which was consulted by the Food and Drug Administration when they later prosecuted Reich for fraud.
At Columbia psychoanalytic, however, Spitzer's career faltered. Psychoanalysis was too abstract, too theoretical, and somehow his patients rarely seemed to improve.  “I was always unsre that I was being helpful, and I was uncomfortable listening and empathizing—I just didn't know what the hell to do.” Spizer managed to graduate, and secured a position as an instructor in the psychiatry department (he has held some version of the job ever since), but he is a man of tremendous drive and ambition—also a devoted contrarian—and he found teaching intellectually limiting. For satisfaction, he turned to research. He worked on depression and on diagnostic interview techniques, but neither line of inquiry produced the radical innovation or epic discovery that he would need to make his name.
As you struggled to find your professional footing in the nineteen-sixties, the still young field of psychiatry was also in crisis. The central issue involved the problem of diagnosis: psychiatrists couldn’t seem to agree on who was sick and what ailed them. A patient identified as a textbook hysteric by one psychiatrist might easily be classified as a hypochondriac depressive by another. Blame for this discrepancy was assigned to the DSM. Critics claimed that the manual lacked what in the world of science is known as “reliability” — the ability to produce a consistent, replicable result — and therefore also lacked scientific validity. In order for any diagnostic instrument to be considered useful, it must have both.
Spitzer had no particular interest in psychiatric diagnosis, but in 1966 you happened to share a lunch table in the Columbia cafeteria with the chairman of the DSM-II task force.”

According to Speigel, you struck up a conversation, got along well, and by the end of the meal you had been offered the job of note-taker on the nomenclature committee.  You were soon promoted to the chairmanship, which you hold when the game begins.
### Game Objectives
Your main concern is the perceived lack of legitimacy of psychiatry and psychology in the scientific community at the end of the 1960's.  Thomas Szasz's critiques of mental illness struck a chord in you.  You worry that the current classification system—especially the concept of 'neurosis'—is unreliable in the technical sense discussed in the 'Research methods' section of the gamebook. You worry that the public perceives psychiatry as convenient politically, particularly insofar as it's history is so closely tied to military needs. And most importantly, you believe that the classification of disease in terms of hypothetical causes that have no basis in biology makes psychiatry the laughing stock of contemporary medicine.

#### Declassification: 1971-1973
At the beginning of the game, you believe (at least you report that you believe) that homosexuality is a disorder.
Your role in this process is extraordinarily complicated, and the historical materials available contradictory and potentially disingenuous.  That means that you, as the student, will have to make some decisions about Spitzer's real motivations.  Here's the story as it is usually told:
 In 1972, you 'just happen' to attend a session on behavioral therapy for homosexuality. There, you are confronted by Ron Gold, a journalist and gay activist, on why you believe homosexuality is a disorder. He challenges you to cite reliable evidence, but you can't (you think Socarides and Bieber are Freudian ideologues).  You agree to set up a meeting with the nomenclature committee and a symposium in 1973 (in the game, Kameny &amp; Gittings will arrange it if they are characters). Gold then invites you and other members of the nomenclature committee to a secret meeting of the Gay-PA to happen at the Honolulu conference in 1973. You agree to go. While many of the psychiatrists at the meeting were distinctly uncomfortable with your presence, you witness an event that you report changed your life. The NPR program “This American Life” produced a wonderful episode titled '81 words' that covers the story.  I'll quote the crucial scene here. Alix Spiegel, the reporter, is the grandson of J. Spiegel.
Ronald Gold: I got invited to it but I was told you know keep it all very quiet and don't say anything and just come to this bar and we'll all be there. So I decided to invite Spitzer to come to this because he had told me essentially that he didn't know any gay psychiatrists and wasn't quite sure there were any. And I said, you just come along.
Alix Spiegel: Ron warned Spitzer not to say anything, he was instructed not to speak, or stare, or indicate in any way that he was anything other than a closeted gay man.
Ronald Gold: But once he got there and saw that the head of the Transaction Analysis Association and the guy who handed out all the training money in the United States, and the heads of various prestigious psychiatry departments at various universities were all there, he couldn't believe it. And he started asking all these dimwitted questions...
Alix Spiegel: Such as?
Ronald Gold: Oh I can't remember, but questions that no gay person would ask.
Alix Spiegel: At the time members of the GayPA were still completely hidden. They hadn't been active in the struggle to change the DSM; they were too fearful of losing their jobs to identify themselves publicly. So when Robert Spitzer, an obviously straight man in a position of power at the APA, appeared at the bar the men of the GayPA were completely unnerved.
Ronald Gold: So the grand dragon of the GayPA, whoever he was I can't remember now, came up to me and said, 'Get rid of him, get him out of here! You've got to get rid of him.' And I said I'm doing nothing of a kind, he's here to help us and you are not doing anything.
Alix Spiegel: And that's when it happened. There in front of Robert Spitzer and the grand dragon of the GayPA. There in the midst of neon coloured drinks and grass skirted waitresses a young man in full army uniform walked into the bar. He looked at Robert Spitzer, he looked at Ronald Gold, he looked at the grand dragon of the GayPA. And then the young man in uniform burst into tears. He threw himself into Ron's arms and remained there, sobbing.
Ronald Gold: Well I had no idea who he was. It turned out he was a psychiatrist, an army psychiatrist based in Hawaii who was so moved by my speech, he told me, that he decided he had to go to a gay bar for the first time in his life. And somehow or other he got directed to this particular bar and saw me and all the gay psychiatrists and it was too much for him, he just cracked up. And it was a very moving event, I mean this man was awash in tears. And I believe that that was what decided Spitzer, right then and there, let's go. Because it was right after that that he said, 'Let's go write the resolution.' And so we went back to Spitzer's hotel room and wrote the resolution.
This is an incredible story. And it may be true.  But there are some problems with the standard tale.
When questioned why you would meet the activists in 1972, you quipped “I could think of no reason not to.” But here is what is wrong with this standard narrative: you (as Spitzer) were already chair of the nomenclature committee when you attended Socarides' session on behavioral therapy.  Everyone know who you were, and what you had been tasked with.  Everyone knew that the APA was going to make a major decision in 1973 on homosexuality, and that that decision was the responsibility of the nomenclature committee. At the same time, you knew, given the protests in 1970 and 1971, that this panel was probably going to be shut down by protesters. With the distance of history, we now know that the protesters had maps of the conference hotel with their plans to disrupt this session laid out in detail. Some of these maps may well have made their way into the hands of the APA administration – i.e. you. So why where you there?
Spitzer reports not changing his mind about homosexuality until the events at the Tiki bar – but the proposal was put forward by Spitzer and passed at the same conference that the Tiki bar event took place. Despite what Gold and you say, it seems that there is not enough time to orchestrate such an important move with the careful, deliberate method you managed in the handful of days at a conference.
Third, this standard story leaves out the contributions of Judd Marmor and John Spiegel, both of whom worked hard to draft the proposal, and push it through the executive board in 1973.  
We leave it up to you (the student) to determine if Spitzer really did change his mind in 1973, or if he knew what he was doing all along. What you have to accomplish between 1971 and 1973 is:
Work with Judd Marmor and John Spiegel to draft a proposal to remove homosexuality from the list of mental disorders as they appear in the DSM-II. Balance the psychoanalysts, who may worry about their position of power in the psychiatric community, with the demands of the gay activists and the evidence produced by Hooker and Marmor that homosexuality is not per se damaging to the mental health of the individuals. The original wording of Spitzer's proposal (which you should not copy, but use as a model) is available – see the game master for the PDF.  It is APA Position Statement 197310.
You wish to retain, however, a diagnosis for those who believe that their homosexuality is damaging to their mental health, and who seek out help for homosexuality.  This new category, which you wish to call 'Sexual Orientation Disturbance,' is meant to provide a middle ground position between Marmor and Socarides, as it would allow treatment for individuals who found their homosexual orientation disturbing, thus producing subjective distress.  At the same time, it said nothing about those homosexuals who were comfortable with their orientation.
After the vote in 1973, petition the board for the dissolution of the nomenclature committee, which will be replaced by a task force to rewrite the DSM. This task force should be entirely under your control, from the appointing of members to the criteria of completion.
#### Task Force: 1973-1975
The first thing you must do is propose how the new DSM will be written.  You want the new DSM to be reliable across psychiatrists. Currently, the same behaviors could be classified as different diseases depending on the psychiatrists' theoretical commitments to the origin of those behaviors.  You want to change the taxonomy so that psychological disorders are classified according to “the criteria that have been shown by research study to have some validity in terms of variables such as course, response to specific therapy, familial pattern, etc,” (1979) thereby unifying diagnosis across theoretical traditions.
##### Proposed Study
Propose to the research committee a meta-study of existing research on the reliability of psychiatric diagnosis according to Cohen's Kappa. There are five existing studies available to survey:
•	Schmidt, H. O. &amp; Fonda, C.P. (1956) “The reliability of psychiatric diagnosis: a new look” J abnor. Soc., Psychol., 52, 262-7 - 426 patients admitted to a state hospital in CT.
•	Kreitman, N. (1961) “The Reliability of Psychiatric Diagnosis” J ment. Sci., 107, 876-86 – 90 consecutive new referrals to an out-patient clinic in England
•	Beck, A.T., Ward, C.H. Mendleson, H., Mock, J.E. &amp; Ebaugh , J.K. (1962) “Reliability of psychiatric diagnosis: 2. A study of consistency of clinical judgments and ratings.” Amer. J. Psychiat. 119, 351-7   - 153 patients randomly selected from new referrals to out-patient services in Philadelphia
•	Sandifer, M.G. Hordern, A. Timbury, G.C. &amp; Green, L. M. (1964) “Psychiatric diagnosis: A comparative study in North Carolina, London and Glasgow” Brit. J. Psychiat. 114, 1-9 – 91 patients at three hospitals in NC
•	The US-UK Diagnostic Project [Cooper, J. E., Kendell, R. E., Gurland, B. J., Sharpe, L., Copeland, J.R.M., &amp; Simon, R. (1972) Psychiatric Diagnosis in New York and London, London: Oxford University Press – multiple studies
 The details of this meta-study are in Spitzer &amp; Fleiss (1974). Your instructor will specify whether you ought to preform these calculations yourself, and report your findings, or whether you can report the findings of the actual Spitzer and Fleiss, depending on the level of the class and your familiarity with statistics.
##### Defining 'Mental Illness'
During the process of drafting the definition of 'Sexual Orientation Disturbance', it became clear to you that the lack of a clear definition of 'mental illness' or its corollary 'mental health' was hindering the discussion.
You have two objectives during this period.  Your task force has to propose a new definition of mental illness that will be included in the DSM-III. Your group will not actually write the DSM-III for this game (in reality, it took until 1980), but you are to pass two major parts of that process: first, that the classification be based on symptoms and not putative causes; and second, that 'mental disorder' is a subset of 'medical disorder' and should be investigated and treated according to the medical model.  These two features make up what the core of what we now call 'descriptive psychiatry.' Prior to this period, a single patient could be diagnosed with different conditions, depending on the theoretical bent of the psychiatrist treating that patient. The unreliability of that classification scheme made many in the medical community—as well as psychiatrists like Thomas Szasz—question the legitimacy of the entire discipline. By unifying and regularizing the diagnostic criteria for psychiatric diagnosis, you can provide a firm basis for justifying psychiatry's role in medicine.
The first of these two tasks entails that you replace the current classification in terms of 'neurosis' and 'psychosis' with evidence-based classifications. Your approach is based on what was called the 'St Louis' approach after psychiatrists at Washington University in St Louis' Barnes Hospital developed it in the 1960s. The approach is summarized in Feighner et al. (1972), which you should present to the APA in 1972.
In Spitzer's own words:
Whereas in the standard system the clinician determines to which of the various diagnostic stereotypes his patient is closest, in the St. Louis system the clinician determines whether his patient satisfies explicit criteria.  For example, for a diagnosis of the depressive form of primary affective disorder the three requirements are dysphoric mood, a psychiatric illness lasting at least one month with no other pre-existing psychiatric condition, and at least five of the following eight symptoms: poor appetite or weight loss; sleep difficulty; loss of energy; agitation or retardation; loss of interest in usual activities or decrease in sexual drive; feelings of self-reproach or guilt; complaints or actual diminished ability to think or concentrate; and thoughts of death or suicide.” (1974, p. 345-6)

The second of these entails that the classifications focus on the treatments of conditions, rather than the causes of the conditions—thus, if two conditions are treated the same, they likely are the same. According to the St. Louis approach, it doesn't matter if the depressive form of primary affective disorder originates in childhood or recent trauma, the diagnosis—and hence the treatment—would be the same.
Allow me to take a moment to point out your conflict with other psychiatrists: Freud repeatedly asserted that the psychoanalysts was not interested in the outward manifestation of psychosis or neurosis, (e.g. p. 318 of Introductory Lectures), but rather in their origin. For Freudian psychiatry, a symptom was only a clue to how the individual mind in question had hidden away the true cause. It was the goal of psychiatry not to describe and classify symptoms, but to understand from where they originated.
In course of this reclassification, it becomes clear to you that constructing a taxonomy of mental disorders without a clear criteria for which conditions should appear in the nomenclature is not a viable strategy (see Sptizer, 1978, p. 15-16).  As a part of the redrafting of the DSM-III, you need to convince the APA to create a criteria for identifying mental disorders.  
Your strategy is to define 'mental disorder' as a subset of 'medical disorder'.  The concept of a 'medical disorder' entails (a) negative consequences of the condition, (b) an inferred or identified orgasmic disfunction and (c) an implicit call to action (ibid, p. 17). You intentionally use the term 'disorder' instead of 'disease' or 'illness,' as the former does not imply a progressive pathophysiological condition. Classifying medical disorders is an exercise in identifying conditions of orgasmic disfunction that, because of the negative consequences of that condition contain an implicit call to action. Implicit in the call to action is “the assumption that something has gone wrong with the human organism.” (italics his, ibid p. 18).
You propose the following definition of mental disorder:
A Medical disorder is a relatively distinct condition resulting from an organismic dysfunction which in its fully developed or extreme form is directly and intrinsically associated with distress, disability, or certain other types of disadvantage.  The disadvantage may be of a physical, perceptual, sexual, or interpersonal nature. Implicitly there is a call for action on the part of the person who has the condition, the medical or its allied professions, and society.
A mental disorder is a medical disorder whose manifestations are primarily signs or symptoms of a psychological (behavioral) nature, or if physical, can be understood only using psychological concepts. (1978, p. 18)
You should arrange an open session in 1974 to present your proposed definition of mental disorder prior to presenting it to the executive committee for vote in 1975.
Both of your tasks in this time period will put you at odds with psychoanalysts – including those who have been your allies on the removal of homosexuality. While you are welcome to create your own arguments for both of these claims, the strongest argument you probably have is that the DSM-III should be theoretically neutral.  
While you championed the removal of 'homosexuality' from the list of mental disorders, you are more concerned with the major changes you are attempting in the DSM-III.  Since homosexuality is such a flash-point in these debates, you believe it advisable to include a condition for homosexuals who are dissatisfied with their orientation.  You would like to propose 'homodysphilia.' Members of the taskforce, which you selected, may object to this classification. They will be hard to disagree with-- they are, after all, experts in human sexuality who you chose precisely because they had expertise you lacked. But you truly believe that you will not get your changes to pass without a compromise here.
You are amenable to other names: 'ego-dystonic homosexuality' may be more to their liking – and it's a political compromise anyway, so the name doesn't really matter that much.
Fission: Stick with the APA.
##### Summary
Your main task is to purge the DSM of taxonomies based in theory in favor of 'evidence-based' taxonomies.  In your words, you want to remove all diagnoses based on theoretical inter-psychic conflicts, and replace them with diagnoses based on behavior. For example, 'neurotic depression' is distinguished from 'depression' simply in terms of the notion of the Freudian concept of 'neurosis'.  At the same time, the psychopharmacological treatment for 'anxiety' and 'depression' are identical. What use is there in taxonomically distinguishing between two conditions for which the treatment is identical—especially if the causes of these conditions are entirely theoretical.
####Specific Assignments:
Present a paper on the Feighner Criteria to the APA in 1972, distinguishing it from the approach of the DSM-II.
Also in 1973, through the Nomenclature committee, propose a new DSM that will be based on descriptions of symptoms, not etiology of the condition.
In 1973, work with Ron Gold to draft a proposal to remove homosexuality immediately.  The argument here is the one alluded to above: the listing of 'homosexuality' in the official nomenclature does more harm than good, and that is unconscionable for a medical doctor.
Also in '73, propose that the nomenclature committee be disbanded, and the task of producing a new DSM be given to a taskforce under your direction.
Propose a research study on the reliability of psychiatric diagnosis in '73
Hold an open hearing in '74 on the definition of mental illness.

            <Text>#### Committee structure
The APA is overseen by a Board of Directors, which is responsible for maintaining the organization, and approving all official public proclamations and publications of the organization.  The president, who opens the conference with his or her presidential address, also serves as chair of the Board of Directors during that conference. The secretary of the Board of Directors is responsible for maintaining the minutes for that meeting and implementing whatever policy decisions are required.

##### Responsibilities of the Board of Directors:
* Issue public proclamations.
* Maintain official publications, such as the DSM
* Create ad-hoc committees and task forces, as necessary.
* Oversee and receive reports from the standing committees.


 The membership of the Board of Directors is:

\caption{Terms for Board of Directors members}
\label{table: boardMembership}
\end{longtable}--&gt;

The Board of Directors is one of a handful of standing committees of the APA. Standing committees are permanent institutions, whose membership is elected by the membership at large. Ad hoc (literally 'after the fact') committees or 'task forces' are created by simple majority vote of the Board of Directors and are tasked with generating a report on a specific problem or area of research. Usually, these are formed when the Board of Directors believes it has inadequate information on a specific subject. For the purposes of this game, ad hoc committees will conduct literature reviews on behalf of the Board of Directors and report to the membership. Ad hoc committees disband after the report is accepted by the Board of Directors.  

The Board of Directors has the power to create ad hoc committees or task forces as it sees fit. The membership of those committees may be specified directly by the Board of Directors at the time of creation, left to the chair of the newly created committee to decide, or even determined by popular vote of the membership. That decision is left to the Board of Directors.

Unlike the creation of ad hoc committees or task forces, the creation of new permanent standing committees require a majority vote of the APA membership, not just the Board of Directors. A full proposal for such a committee, specifying its membership structure, voting procedures, rights and responsibilities should be distributed to the membership at least 48 hours before the vote. Dissolving a standing committee requires a majority vote of the membership.

The Board of Directors represents the membership, it does not act in opposition.  It is incredibly important, then, that the Board seeks approval from the membership as a whole at every turn.  The Board is a capable of assigning duties to various subcommittees on its own, but all matters of policy should be turned over to the membership for an up or down vote.

##### Standing Committees
In addition to the Board of Directors, there are currently three standing committees of the APA. All standing committees report directly to the Board of Directors annually.  All standing committees have the right to request an open session at the general conference for whatever they wish. If they want to initiate a vote by membership, however, they must file a request with the Board of Directors. If the Board of Directors approves the request, the standing committee can administer a vote.

###### Research Committee
The research committee is charged with distributing grants to fund research as well as enforcing the APA's Ethical Standards in the practice of Psychology and Psychiatry (see Appendix 7). The Research committee should solicit proposals in the form of a 'Call for Research Grants' that specifies both the deadline for submissions, as well as the time frame for reviewing submissions. The Research Committee should revise the enclosed 'Call for Research Grants' on p. 17 to suit their needs.

In the context of the game, winning a grant entitles the bearer to access the student body for a period of one class session, during which time he or she can perform his or her approved research project. After that period, the grantee will be expected to present his or her findings to the membership as a conference paper / report.

The Research committee should take great care in considering the scientific value of each proposal. The APA does not want to be seen supporting poor or biased research! As such, members of the Research committee are strongly advised to carefully consult the ‘&lt;!--\ref{basicscientificresearch}--&gt;’ on p. &lt;!--\pageref{basicscientificresearch}--&gt;. as well as the '&lt;!--\ref{ethicsofhumanresearch}--&gt;., on p. &lt;!--\pageref{ethicsofhumanresearch}--&gt;. of the gamebook.

The Research committee is also charged with hearing and ultimately ruling on charges of ethical transgression. It alone has the power to censure a member of the APA. And because these powers apply equally to all members, including those sitting on the Board of Directors, this power can be exercised without approval by the Board of Directors.

 The Board of Directors should hold an election each year for a new member of the Research committee.  

Members of the Research committee in 1971:

* L. Tyler (expiring 1972)
* K. Clark (expiring 1973)
* J. Marmor (expiring 1974)
###### Nomenclature Committee
The Nomenclature committee is charged with maintaining the official terminology of psychology and psychiatry.  This is embodied by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, which is the definitive source for definitions and classifications of mental disorders.  It determines who can be diagnosed with what, what treatments are considered responsible and what disorders will be covered by medical insurance. If a condition does not appear in the DSM, psychiatrists cannot treat patients with that condition. Given the increasing importance of health insurance in the 1970s, it is vital to have a standardized diagnostic system to support billable treatments.

Members of the nomenclature committee serve for six years.

Members of the nomenclature committee are strongly advised to carefully consult the ‘&lt;!--\ref{historyofclassificationsofmentalillness}--&gt;,’ starting on p. &lt;!--\pageref{historyofclassificationsofmentalillness}--&gt;. of the gamebook.

Members of the nomenclature committee in 1971:

* G. Albee (expiring 1972)
* J. Spiegel (expiring 1974)
* R. Spitzer (expiring 1976)

###### Program Committee

The Program Committee is charged with scheduling the conferences. The committee must remember that each conference opens with a public address from the sitting president, and each standing committee has the right to a session at each conference. Not all the standing committees will make use of that time, but each should be approached before the schedule is drawn up.

Proposals for symposia and presentations should be solicited from the general population. The committee meets in closed session (i.e. after class) to determine the conference schedule after reviewing all of the materials submitted. It is vitally important that the symposia and papers accepted represent the highest standard for academic work. They should be judged by that standard alone, not with respect to theoretical commitment or viewpoint. The conference schedule should be made available to the membership at least 48 hours before the conference begins (i.e. by Friday evening before a new conference).

The Program Committee is composed of three members, each of which serve three year terms. Hence, the Board of Directors must hold an election for a new member every year.

The schedule for the conference is set by the 'Program Committee', but there are a number of business events that must take place each year. These are outlined in Table 4.

Program committee in 1971:

* E. Hooker (expiring 1972)
* A. Anastasi (expiring 1973)
* P. Gebhard (expiring 1974)

#### Elections

The following shows elections that must be held each year, and the character vacating that position in parentheses. Characters serve through to the end of the conference in the year indicated. The VP immediately becomes the president: so while Bandura vacates the position of VP at the end of the conference in 1971, he becomes President at that moment.  The election in 1971 is for the VP of 1972, who will be President in 1973.

Homosexuality-Socandes 1199
￼a conservative estimate is that be tween 2,500,000 and 4,000,000 adult American males sufier from this con- dition. By way of comparison, a Public Health Service report esti- mates the four major illnesses in this country (1963 to 1965) as: heart disease, 3,619,000; arthritis and rheumatism, 3,481,00O; impairment (except paralysis) of the back and spine, 1,769,000; mental and nervous disease, 1,767,000.u
The female homosexual finds her- self in a paradoxical situation. Al- though suffering in essence with the same disorder as her male counter- part, little concern has been manifest by either the medical or legal pro- fessions about her condition. She too, however, needs special medical, legal, and sociological consideration.
Many writers prefer to use the term "lesbianism" to describe the clinical condition of female homo- sexuality. This reflects an attempt to romanticize and minimize it. Ho- mosexual relations between women are often considered superficial and some sources do not regard female homosexual contacts as sexual at all despite intense orgastic experiences between the women involved. Never- theless, their plight is as grave if not more so than that of the male homo- sexuals. For example, the loss of a homosexual partner can lead the bereft female homosexual to severe depressions and suicide with greater frequency than in the male.
I have dealt intensively with the illnesses diagnosed as perversions,'' '5 especially with homosexuality, fol the past 15 years-both in clinical practice and in teaching. Our first step is to ask ourselves "What is a homosexual?" fn essence, a homo- sexual is a person who consistently and from inner necessity engages in homosexual acts. This pattern arises from faulty sexual identity, a prod- uct of the earliest years of life. Typ- ically, we find a pathological family constellation in which there is a domineering, crushing mother who will not allow the developing child to
achieve autonomy from her and an absent, weak, or rejecting father.
There are two categories of home' sexuality: obligatory (true) homo- sexuality and episodic homosexual behavior. The latter is characterized by isolated homosexual acts without the stereotypy, the corhpulsivity, of the former and is due to the con- scious desire for variational experi- ence, the achievement of "sPecial gains," such as power and Prestige, or the quest for unusual sensations. Such transient behavior may occur in specific situations as well; it may be rampant in prisons, remote set- tlements, or during other tYPes of confinement where persons of the opposite sex are not available. Ex- cept for those already predisposed to homosexuality through early psy- chological trauma, the individual reverts to heterosexual behavior when members of the oPPosite sex are again available. Current research points to the fact that a person does not become a true obligatorY homo- sexual if the initial design is not laid out by 3 years of age, that is, during the preoedipal period of develoP- ment.
There is a high incidence of Para- noia or paranoid-like symptomato- logy in overt homosexuals. This is related to the medical fact that overt obligatory homosexuality is either a fixation or regression to the earliest stages of ego development. As a re- sult, archaic and primitive mental mechanisms belonging to the earliest stages of life characterize the homo- sexual's behavior. Also, homosexual- ity, obligatory or not, can be seen in the schizophrenic in his frantic at- tempt to establish some vestige of object relations as an expression of the fragmented and disorganized psychic apparatus with which he has to struggle.
It is misleading to classifY homo- sexuality as a sociopathic disorder. Not all homosexuals or perhaps even a majority display the "absence of conscience" mechanism so charac- teristic of the so-called psychopath.
The compulsivity of the sexual pression, its insistence for despite all dangers to the
and all risks, gives the
that one does not care about lished social institutions or oneself. The annals of political tory include personalities at very highest levels, men with exceptionally well-developed

2. Homosexual obiect choice is .not innate or instinctual nor is hetcr- cexual object choice since botlr are learned behavior. The choice of sex- rul object is not predetermined by
chromosomal tagging. Heter&lt;lsexual object choice is determined from birth due to cultural and environ- mental indoctrination. It is support- .ed by universal human concepts of lnating and the family unit with the omplementariness and contrast be-
the two sexes- It is further determined bv zVz billion years of
evolution and is a producl of sexual differentiation, at first y based on reproduction but widened to include sexual ification, eg, from one-celled
al fission the development of two-celled sexual reproduction to
rate entire organ differentiation finally to the development of rate individuals reciprocally
to each other anatomically. nologically, psychologically,
in many other ways.
Only massive childhood fears can
ge and disrupt the standard female pattern. Such early un- ious feals are responsible for
later development of homosex- ty.
3. Homosexual behavior which is igatory ( episodic t is prac- by individuals through choice a variety of motivations and ld not be confused with true
xuality. These motivations as complex as any other moti- which may influence humnn ior: personal gain. power, Farch for a variational experience (an extra sexual "thrill" r, pr.eferred and position, etc. This form not caused by unconscious fears ensuing guilt but is due to con- deliberate choice. One must ull.y differentiate between the tory and the nonobligatoly as latter type would like to mask
behind true honrosexuality in order to save plidc and iustify its occur- rence.
4. Since thc obligator.v lromosex- ual is suflering fronr an illness it is obvious that hc should not be lren- alized fol tlre consequent activities carried out in private, not oflensive to public decency, and in Jlartner- ship with a consenting adult. He should not be made to suffer special penalties because of the manifesta- tion of his illness so long as it is not
ac&lt;omp:rnied b-y antisrrcial or crim- inal behavior.
The view that obligatory homo- sexuality per se is punishable by law and thc view that it is, in fact, a medical problern are antithetical and this matter requires revision. How- ever. any change in the legal code should be accompanied by a clear- cut statement as to the nature of obligatory homosexualit.y, its diag- nosis as a form of mental illness, and a universal declaration of support
for its treatment by qualified medical practitioners.
The Wolfenden report'' succeed- ed in having legislation passed in England redressing the inequities Iaced by the homosexual but it re- grettably failed both the homosexual and the public by not making it ex- plicit that homosexuality is an emo- tional illness and, therefore, lies within the province of medicine. One might have recommended this addition to the Wolfenden report:
Homosexurtlitv is a form of e'motional disorder q'hit'h mav cause such grave clisruptiori to the equililrrium of thc in- dividual that all meaningful rt'lation- .ships in life are damaged from the outsel anrl peculiarly susceptible to breakdou'n :lnd destruction. Furlher. attitudes tou':rrd the olrllosite s€x ar€ so fille&lt;l q'ith dislrust, abhorrence, hate. anrl revulsion as tcl render thcnr imp&lt;lssiblc of anv relationshilr except on the' mo.st superficial and briltle basis, if then. The.sc characteristi&lt;'s are an outcome of childhood fears u'hich r.ripl&gt;lr, the individual in his total ad:rptation.
All nrale homosexuals suffer, para- doxically, fronr the yearning to be a
mart, not a woman ils conlmonly as- sumeal. They ho1;c to :rchieve a "shot" of nrasculinity in the homo- sexual act. Ostensitrly they ma.\'l)e- have in an alTcctionitte and kindly way towtird the sexuirl parttter bttt this is a veneer, a rationillization, to cover the life-saving, ego-saving o1t- er{rtion of obligatory homosuxualitv. The homosexuill must carry out his act; unless he does he will sufler in- tolerable anxiety and experience massive threat to his psychic organ-
ization nnd functioning. Like the addict, he must have his "fix."
In the light of clinical research the honrosexual symptom can be seen as an intricately designed de- fense whose purpose is to maintain the equilibrium of a severely disturb- ed individual. Tampering with his psyche by unqualificd persons is to be condemned as he may become seriously disorganized if a prema- turc attempt is made to interrupt his homosexual activities. Conversely, an individual, however impelled to- ward them, who has refrained from homosexual activities may be tragi- cally pushed into them by unwise guidance.
5. There is no obligatory homo- sexual who can be considered to be health.y. The very existence of this condition precludes it. Despite the appearance at any given time of adequate life performance, there is always extreme conflict present which threatens to disrupt this frag- ile adiustment.
6. As oblig:rtory homosexuality carl not be considered to be a legal isstre, so it can not be viewed as a problem of morality. As with psy- chosis and neurosis, it can not be regarded as n consequence of im- molality ol a manifestation of evil spilits occupying the body for which special tortures were devised and special legal punishment was ex- acted.
These misconceptions must be corrected. It would, however, be the utmost folly to remed.Y then.r and then disrniss or overlook the deeP

￼psychological disturbance which is the basis of the homosexual condi- tion. Some well-intentioned groups would have us not only do away with legal and moral issues but have us announce that homosexuals are not ill at all. They point to disturbances among heterosexuals and attempt to make a comparison. While the ex- istence of psychosis and neurosis are, of course, found in heterosexual- ity, the heterosexual orientation is not, of itself, an indication of path- ological condition while homosex- uality always is. The inability to function heterosexually and the ex- treme hostility toward the opposite sex originating in the fear of one's impulses toward the mother has led to a wholesale flight from the female forever and to a compromise adapta- tion of choosing a male for sexual gratification and to save the self from intolerable anxiety.
We practice today in the atmos- phere of a sweeping sexual revolu- tion. Together with the mainstream heterosexual revolt has come the an- nouncement that a homosexual rev- olution is also in progress and that homosexuality should be granted total acceptance as a valid form of sexual functioning, different from but equal to heterosexuality. Such acceptance of homosexuality, as being a simple variation of normal- ity, is naive, not to say grounded in ignorance. Equally misleading is the idea that it is merely an asPect of normal development, a transient stage of adolescence, without mean- ingful sequallae. That we, as phy- sicians, could be persuaded to overlook such tcnden&lt;'ies among our young people is a harmful fantasy as shown by the fact that colleges can be pressured to charter homo- sexual groups on campus with all the privileges of other scholastic alrd social organizations, thereby lending tacit approval.
The implications of such trends are profound. I'or the adolescent, they make him uncertilin and con- fused. Even for an adult, struggling
to strengthen what may be a frail heterosexual- organization, the vi- cissitudes of maintaining sexual adequacy may drive him into a self- despising homosexual pattern. He does not know how else to resolve the deep conflicts which have per- sisted and tortured him since early childhood. Homosexuality is a fore- doomed attempt to find a panacea for the tormenting fear which origi- nated in early childhood and like any unrealistic solution remains un- satisfactory at all times and disas- trous much of the time.
It is vitally important to realize this fundamental point: the diag- nosis of homosexuality can not be self-made, imposed by jurists, ar- ticulated by clergy, or speculated about by social scientists. True ob- ligatory homosexuality is a complex condition and has to be difrerenti- ated from episodic homosexual be- havior entered into for a variety of conscious motivations as stated.
If the homosexual is to be granted his human right as a medical pa- tient, issues which becloud his status should be clarified. Above all, the homosexual must be recognized as an individual who presents a med- ical problem.
The whole issue of homosexuality must be transformed into one more scientific challenge to medicine which has time and again been :rble to alleviate the plaguing illnesses of man. With this respected leadership on the part of the physician, we will see a surge of support for the study and treatment of the disorder by all the techniques and knowledge nvail- able through the great resources and medical talent of the United States.

### Your Biography
You are Thomas S. Szasz, MD, Professor of Psychiatry at State University of New York at Syracuse.
In 1960, you published The Myth of Mental Illness (T. Szasz, 1960), which defends your view that “there is no such thing as ‘mental illness’” (p 1).  To you, psychiatry and psychology are the study of human behavior. Scientists who practice these fields engage in the most common of all human behaviors: they talk to people. Their regular use of terminology like ‘patient,’ ‘diagnosis’, and ‘treatment’ obscures this fact and makes us think psychiatrists are doing something other than simply communicating. Worse yet, the use of nouns like ‘libido’ and ‘psychic energy,’ implies objects that can be studied, and hence, when we use them, we think we’re talking about some actual thing rather than just a mere theoretical construct. All of this medicalizes normal human behavior, and makes normal human communication a ‘treatment.’  
Your views have not, shall we say, been received with open arms. In 1961, The Commissioner of the New York State Department of Mental Hygiene publicly demanded that you be fired from your tenured position, on the grounds that your views—as articulated in The Myth of Mental Illness—were inconsistent with your position as Professor of Psychiatry. These events added to your notoriety, making you widely known, but often misrepresented.
You are often accused of ‘not believing in mental illness.’ That isn’t quite right. The phrase ‘mental illness’ is, after all, a noun phrase. That means it denotes an entity or a state of being. You do not deny that there are people who behave in ways that are destructive to themselves and others; nor do you deny that talking to another person—especially one trained in communication—can be very helpful indeed. But you do deny that there is any thing called ‘mental illness.’ That is, you deny that the phrase ‘mental illness’ refers to an entity or a state of being. If it has any meaning at all, it refers to a set of actions or behaviors.
The Philosopher of Science Karl Popper heavily influences your reasoning for this position. Popper famously held that for an area of inquiry to be scientific, it had to make bold, surprising conjectures that were, in principle, falsifiable. This was the criterion of demarcation between scientific inquiry and 'pseudoscientific' inquiry: if a theory was able to explain away any possible phenomenon that might threaten that theory, that theory was thereby pseudoscientific, rather than scientific. To be scientific, a theory must make claims that  might be wrong. The more explicit a theory is in specifying the ways in which it might be wrong, the more that theory is scientific.  One of Popper’s famous and controversial examples was Freudian psychoanalysis.  According to Popper, Freudianism had developed to such a point that any evidence presented against the theory would be incorporated into the theory by Freudians as evidence for ‘repression’ or ‘sublimation.’ Famously, he pointed out, Freud was never, himself, psychoanalyzed. When asked why, he would retort that he 'did it himself,' but that response was frequently rejected as illegitimate when produced by his patients.
But Popper went a step further. He also questioned the doctrine of ‘historicism’ that he saw underlying much of social and psychological “science” of the early 20th century (Popper, 1957). Popper believed that the founders of the ‘human sciences’ had become enamored with the progress made by the ‘natural sciences’ in the 18th and 19th centuries. This progress rested largely on the belief that for any given event in the physical world, one could fully explain that event by specifying the physical conditions of the world prior to that event. In short, that all physical events were physically determined by pre-existing states of affairs. Early psychologists and sociologists adopted this belief wholesale, and inappropriately assumed that in order to explain the actions of a person or a society, one only need to look at the pre-existing conditions, and wait for the laws of nature to take their course. The most obvious example of this reasoning is the work of Karl Marx, who held that socialist revolution was the inevitable arc of human development.  
The same kind of reasoning exists in Freudian and Jungian psychology. Each of them believes, largely as a hypothesis not a defended conjecture, that a true explanation for a person’s behavior is one that specifies the relevant events in that person’s childhood. This belief can be found in the earliest history of psychiatry and psychology (see the “Psychoanalysis” section of the gamebook).
You reject all of this.  To you, the human being cannot be explained in these historicist or deterministic ways. Communication between people is not determined by psychosocial antecedents.  It is free and voluntary.
Thus, to you, psychiatry should be based on the analysis of what you call ‘sign-behavior’: the manipulation and interpretation of symbols for the sake of communication by humans. Psychiatry constructed in this way, you argue, would less resemble medicine than it would other traditional disciplines focused on the understanding of symbols and their manipulation: philosophy, linguistics, semiotics, etc.  On the other hand, the brain is best understood using the terminology of biology and chemistry, and the new and improving field of neurology and neuroscience. Psychiatry as practiced today is trapped by its own nomenclature, which descends from the unfortunate identification with medicine and the idealization of historicist explanations.
Consider, for example, the following passage in the Myth of Mental Illness:
There is, as I noted before, a serious discrepancy between what psychotherapists and psychoanalysts do and what they say they do. What they do, quite simply, is to communicate with other persons (often called “patients”) by means of language,m nonverbal signs and rules; they analyze—that is, discuss, explain and speculate about—the communicative interactions which they observe and in which they themselves engage; and they often recommend engaging in the same types of conduct and avoiding others.  I believe that these phrases correctly describe the actual operations of psychoanalysts and psychosocially orientated psychiatrists. But what do these experts tell themselves and others concerning their work? They talk as if they were physicians, physiologists, biologists or even physicists. We hear about “sick patients” and “treatments,” “diagnoses” and “hospitals,” “instincts” and “endocrine functions,” and, of course, “libido” and “psychic energies,” both “free” and “bound.” All this is fakery and pretense whose purpose is to “medicalize” certain aspects of the study and control of human behavior. (p 4-5)
Another common theme in your work is the comparison between advocates of psychiatry and religious zealots. In the Myth of Mental Illness, you claimed:
While Freud criticized revealed religion for the patent infantilism that it is, he ignored the social characteristics of closed societies and the psychological characteristics of their loyal supporters. He thus failed to see the religious character of the movement he himself was creating. It is in this way that the paradox that is psychoanalysis—a system composed of a historicist theory and an antihistoricist therapy—come into being. (p 7)
In this case, Freud himself is at fault for failing to anticipate the fervor with which his followers would pursue his theory. It is the psychoanalysts of today who have turned psychiatry into an ideology.
Your most recent book, The Manufacture of Madness: A Comparative Study of the Inquisition and the Mental Health Movement, argues that society constantly worries about the unknown and threatening, whether those come from outside or inside the particular society. Throughout the ages, charlatans have offered society comfort and security in the form of witchcraft and religion. By classifying and controlling a perceived threat from the ‘mentally ill’, psychiatry has taken over this role as ‘protector’. And hence, is not significantly different than those who prosecuted the Spanish inquisition (T. S. Szasz, 1970).
### Victory Objectives
Take your role as gadfly seriously. Question everyone and everything. Object strongly to speakers to assert, without evidence, explanations that appeal to non-existent entities, or that classify actions (behaviors) as states of being.
The re-writing of the DSM is an important moment in the history of psychology. While you agree with many of the critiques of the DSM-II, you worry that those leading the charge for a new DSM have ulterior motives. The economics of medicine is increasingly dependent upon both medical insurance (a new entity in the American economy) and pharmaceuticals.  Both of these entities are highly regulated; and both insist on careful categorization and 'scientific reliability' before paying for treatments.  You suspect that some of the individuals (including Robert Spitzer) involved in the rewriting of the DSM are motivated not by a dissatisfaction with the scientific validity of existing categories like you, but rather to create a diagnostic manual that will meet the requirements of the insurance and pharmaceutical companies. A DSM that results from these pressures, and not intellectual virtues, will reflect more the demands of economic policy than concern for patients well-being.
At the same time, you want to promote your theory of psychiatry as analysis of sign-behavior as a relevant alternative to psychoanalysis. To that end, you strongly support anything that characterizes psychology as talk-therapy, but reject any attempt to replace talk therapy with psychoactive drugs.
When, and if, the game reaches a point of attempting to define mental illness, you need to propose, and work to pass, an official statement from the APA that states:
	There is no 'thing' called 'mental illness,' only  sets of behaviors that may be destructive to an individual and his or her society.
#### Game Strategy
Your notoriety is a double-edged sword. Yes, people listen when you talk. But most people at the APA publicly disagree with everything you say. That does not mean that they don't privately agree.
You are, in many respects, like the Socratic gadfly. You question the hidden assumptions upon which the entire industry of psychiatry and psychology is built. So while some may privately agree with your arguments, they suspect that your position would undermine their livelihoods, and hence will do nothing to support you in public.
It is important then not to make grand public pronouncements that will alienate your colleagues. The fact is that you believe that psychiatry, correctly constructed, does have an important role to play in contemporary society. You are thrilled that the APA has decided to drop the DSM II. But you are deeply concerned about what will replace it. You need to find ways to work with your colleagues to ensure that the new version of the DSM avoids hollow, meaningless terminology ‘libido’, avoids pseudoscientific (i.e. not falsifiable) claims, and remains cognizant of the dangers of medicalizing normality.
### Specific Assignments
Present a version of your argument in Myth of Mental Illness in 1971. This is already on the schedule, so you should get working now.
Propose either a paper in which you critique the medical model used by psychiatry, or collaborate with G. Albee on a symposium on the medical model. This would be best presented in 1972, before the DSM-III is in the works.
Oppose the proposal to create a special committee on the psychology of women and the committee on women in psychology, NOT because you are sexist, but for three reasons (1) it isn't clearly distinguished from other areas of psychology, such as 'social psychology', (2) the name itself is separatist and exclusionary and (3) the organization seems to be a pressure group affiliated with feminist political causes. (the last of these can be tied to the Leona Tyler principle).  GAME NOTE: There is no evidence that the real Szasz actually put forward any arguments like these, or that he is against the women's movement. Quite the contrary: he has long been a supporter of the empowerment of women. But it is consistent with his outspoken libertarianism and his views on science to avoid the rigidification of terms (such as 'woman') when they are put into policy. Thus, you must NOT articulate an argument against women's empowerment, but rather about the ways in which codifying a classification in the official language tends to exclude and reify the identity of a group of people, which then excludes others and leads to self-limitations.
Warning: Your arguments against psychiatry are almost entirely against psychoanalysts.  You argue that ‘mental illness’ cannot be a disease because it has no basis in physiology. But the growing success of psychopharmacology threatens to derail your argument. In short: you hold that if it is a disease, it must have a physiological explanation. But here’s where you might have a problem: if neuroscience and/or psychopharmacology were capable of providing a coherent explanation of schizophrenia, for example, would you allow schizophrenia as a genuine mental illness? Or would still hold that ‘mental illness’ is only a metaphor for human behavior?

            <Comments>The careful reader will notice that your critiques here parallel the 'idols' outlined by Francis Bacon in his classic Novum Organon. See the discussion of Bacon in the 'History of the Definition of Mental Illness' in the gamebook.
Actually, this is historically inaccurate. Popper did, in fact, use Freud and Adler, along with Marx, as his primary examples of pseudoscientific research in Conjectures and Refutations (1962), which was published after Szasz' The Myth of Mental Illness. Popper's work before 1960 includes his The Logic of Scientific Discovery (1959), which lays out the theory of falsifiability as demarcation criterion, but does not illustrate it with Freudianism. In the same way, his 1945 The Open Society and Its Enemies—which Szasz cites as influential—contains a few off-hand comparisons between Freud and Marx, but does not articulate the connection in a systematic way.
The historian of ideas may notice that this view is Kantian in nature: human language, which is the essential, identifying ability of humanity, is itself uncaused and spontaneous.</Comments>

            <Title>Definitions used by the APA</Title>
            <Text>#### Definitions used by the APA

The following are quoted from current websites of the American Psychological Association and the American Psychiatric Association.

##### Definition of "psychologist"

APA policy on the use of the title "psychologist" is contained in the General Guidelines for Providers of Psychological Services, which define the term "Professional Psychologist" as follows:

&gt;Psychologists have a doctoral degree in psychology from an organized, sequential program in a regionally accredited university or professional school.

The APA is not responsible for the specific title or wording of any particular position opening, but it is general pattern to refer to master's-level positions as counselors, specialists, clinicians, and so forth (rather than as "psychologists"). In addition, it is general practice to refer to APA accredited programs as "APA-accredited" rather than "APA approved." The position as described must be in conformity with the statute regulating the use of the title psychologist and the practice of psychology in the state in which the job is available.

##### Definition of "psychology"

Psychology is the study of the mind and behavior. The discipline embraces all aspects of the human experience — from the functions of the brain to the actions of nations, from child development to care for the aged. In every conceivable setting from scientific research centers to mental health care services, "the understanding of behavior" is the enterprise of psychologists.
##### Definition of “psychiatrist”

A psychiatrist is a physician who specializes in the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of mental illnesses and substance use disorders. It takes many years of education and training to become a psychiatrist: He or she must graduate from college and then medical school, and go on to complete four years of residency training in the field of psychiatry. (Many psychiatrists undergo additional training so that they can further specialize in such areas as child and adolescent psychiatry, geriatric psychiatry, forensic psychiatry, psychopharmacology, and/or psychoanalysis.) This extensive medical training enables the psychiatrist to understand the body's functions and the complex relationship between emotional illness and other medical illnesses. The psychiatrist is thus the mental health professional and physician best qualified to distinguish between physical and psychological causes of both mental and physical distress.

            <Text>## Robert Hopcke, MD
### Your Biography
You are Robert Hopcke. Your character is actually a bit of a historical anachronism.  
The other characters in this game are were actually around in the early 1970s, typically in their 40's and 50's at the time. You were not. In fact, your first book doesn't appear until 1989. That means that today, in 2011, you are active in psychoanalytic circles.  Your autobiography is available online at http://www.robhopcke.com/MyProfessionalExperience.en.html. I'll quote the summary here:
I have two degrees in counseling: a Master of Arts in Theology, with a Pastoral Counseling emphasis, from Pacific Lutheran Theological Seminary, which is the degree under which I received my Marriage and Family Therapist license in 1986, and a second Master of Arts in Clinical Counseling from California State University, Hayward (now Cal State East Bay). My background encompasses a number of different models and approaches.  I am most known for being a Jungian-oriented therapist but also important to my professional identity has been formal training in pastoral counseling and spiritual direction, long-term object-relations psychodynamic treatment, cognitive-behavioral approaches to depression, health and sexuality concerns, and many years of being an "out" gay male therapist and activist in the Bay Area GLBT community. I am a best-selling author, public speaker, teacher, supervisor and professional consultant.
We've included you in the game to voice a gay-positive Jungian perspective. Jung, himself,  was not very gay-friendly. And those who follow his theory strictly continued that tradition throughout the 1970’s.  Thus, in order to find a gay-positive Jungian, we have to break the historical accuracy of the game. As a matter of actual history, you didn't publish this perspective on Jungian psychology until the late 1980's, but that's not important here.
### Game Objectives
Working with your fellow psychiatrists (MD's), create a proposal to limit the treatment of the mentally ill to medical doctors.  This should be presented in 1972. Expect a furious response from Albee, and maybe even Szasz.  You may choose to work out a compromise with Albee via E. Hooker, who, like you, has multiple degrees.
Your role in this game is to represent the aspect of the Jungian psychoanalytic tradition that was friendly to homosexuals. Jung himself was not.  Your primary work has been to reformulate a version of Jungian theory that is consistent with the new taxonomy of sexuality in the DSM. You should present that vision as a paper in 1975.
You should oppose any attempt to remove psychoanalytic language or categories from the DSM. At the same time, you should make sure that the Jungian perspective is protected in the manual.
When, and if, the game reaches a point of trying to define mental illness, you must pass a psychoanalytic interpretation of mental disorder / illness.

##### Little Albert

Contrary to most textbooks that repeat the myth that 'Little Albert' was successfully deconditioned by Watson, was adopted by a family in North Baltimore and went on to live a long, happy, normal life; there is recent evidence to suggest that Little Albert died as a child. 

Using photographs from the family and FBI forensics experts, Beck et al. (2009) argue  that 'Little Albert' was likely Douglas Merritte, who died at age 6 of acquired hydrocephalus, after his mother had left Hopkins.  Watson never deconditioned Little Albert, and we simply have no evidence to determine if his conditioned fears remained until his death.  

See Beck, H. P., Levinson, S., &amp; Irons, G. (2009).  “Finding Little Albert: A Journey to John B. Watson’s Infant Laboratory.” American Psychologist, 64, 605-614. doi: 10.1037/a0017234. The authors conclude:

None of the folktales we encountered during our inquiry had a factual basis. There is no evidence that the baby's mother was 'outraged‚' at her son's treatment or that Douglas's phobia proved resistant to extinction. Douglas was never deconditioned, and he was not adopted by a family north of Baltimore.

Nor was he ever an old man. Our search of seven years was longer than the little boy's life. I laid flowers on the grave of my longtime 'companion' turned, and simultaneously felt a great peace and profound loneliness.

The APA's Monitor carried the story January 2010, 41(1): http://www.apa.org/monitor/2010/01/little-albert.aspx.

There were a number of blog posts that followed, including: http://mindhacks.com/2009/10/22/little-albert-lost-and-found. 

##### Socarides &amp; Bieber

The dates I used in the introduction are not exact, although I've tried to remain faithful where I could. Part of the problem here is that many of the stories that are circulated, even by eyewitnesses, vary.  Ron Gold, for example, dates the events in Hawaii to 1972, but the APA records the 1972 conference in Dallas, and the Hawaii conference to 1973.  

The Dr. H. Anonymous speech actually happened in 1972 during a symposium titled “Psychiatry: Friend or Foe to Homosexuals: A Dialogue”. It also featured Kameny and Gittings in addition to John Fryer. In 1971, Kameny, Gittings and   The panel titled “Lifestyles of non-patient homosexuals,” which the participants joking referred to as “Lifestyles of impatient homosexuals.” It featured Larry Littlejohn of the Society for Individual Rights in San Francisco, Del Martin, a founder the Lesbian activist organization Daughters of Bilitis, Lilli Vincenz, another lesbian activists, and Jack Baker, the gay president-elect of the student body of the University of Minnesota.1 I've found a number of websites and personal stories that get these two distinct events confused. At the risk of perpetuating these confusions, I've combined them into a single event in 1971.

Socarides petitioned the New York District branch for hist task force on sexual deviation. It was granted, and his report filed in 1972.  The leadership rejected the report, on the grounds that its basis in psychoanalytic theory was unacceptable. 

Complicating matters is the existence of NARTH, which has been adopted by many on the religious right in recent years.  In 1995, Socarides gave an interview to the NY Times, promoting his book “Homosexuality: A Freedom Too Far - A Psychoanalyst Answers 1,000 Questions About Causes and Cure and the Impact of the Gay Rights Movement on American Society”, in which he claimed that the declassification occurred because of political pressure and not scientific evidence.  The themes of the interview will be familiar to anyone with even tangential knowledge of the rhetoric of the far right: persecution of conservatives, liberal media bias, gay agendas and conspiracies, etc.  His son, Richard Socarides, who is gay, became a gay activist, advised President Clinton on LGBT issues, and ultimately was elected to the presidency of the activist organization 'Equality Matters.'  That fact has lead many defenders of Socarides to accuse any press figure who mentions it of making an 'ad hominem' attacks against Socarides. 

NARTH continues today under the directorship of Socarides' student Nicolosi.

The UK Newspaper 'The Independent' ran a story in January 2010 by Patrick Strudwick about his experience in gay-to-straight conversion program inspired by Nicolosi. The story created a national concern about psychiatrists in the UK who still may be offering psychotherapy to 'treat' or 'cure' homosexuality. The story is available here: http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/features/the-exgay-files-the-bizarre-world-of-gaytostraight-conversion-1884947.html

##### Leona Tyler Principle / Goldwater Rule

Following the Goldwater affair, the American Psychiatric Association added  section7.3 to their The Principles of Medical Ethics With Annotations Especially Applicable to Psychiatry, which states:

On occasion psychiatrists are asked for an opinion about an individual who is in the light of public attention or who has disclosed information about himself/herself through public media. In such circumstances, a psychiatrist may share with the public his or her expertise about psychiatric issues in general. However, it is unethical for a psychiatrist to offer a professional opinion unless he or she has conducted an examination and has been granted proper authorization for such a statement.

This section has become known as 'The Goldwater Rule.' For a full history, see Mayer, John D. (2010) “The Goldwater Rule: The rationale of the Goldwater Rule” Psychology Today Blog (http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-personality-analyst/201005/the-goldwater-rule)

The American Psychological Association adopted  'Leona Tyler principle' was adopted in 1973 by the American Psychological Association, and still holds today. It states:

&gt; As citizens, members of the APA have the right to advocate for any cause through the myriad of political advocacy organizations, but when psychologists and psychiatrists speak for the profession through APA public stances and proclamations, it should be from science and professional experience.  

The principle was named for Leona Tyler simply because she was president at the time, not necessarily because she advocated for it, as she does in this game. 

##### Marr

David Marr joins Miller and Chomsky at MIT in 1977 and then dies in 1980 of Leukemia. His posthumously published book *Vision* is still standard reading in cognitive science courses.

##### Declassification

The story of the declassification of homosexuality as a mental illness has been retold a couple of times in recent years.  Famously, Alix Spiegel, grandson of John P. Spiegel, produced a version of the story for NPR's show 'This American Life'. The episode, named '81 words' is available online at http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/204/81-words. It is an excellent retelling of these events, and partially inspired this game. Ron Gold's retelling of the event is available here: http://www.queerstories.org/custom.html.

In the character sheet for Spitzer, I express some doubts about the standard story told by Spiegel, because Spitzer's timing and motivation for inserting himself into the controversy doesn't seem to match up for normal person. In a 2005 issue of The New Yorker Magazine, Spiegel writes that 

Despite Spitzer’s genius at describing the particulars of emotional behavior, he didn’t seem to grasp other people very well. Jean Endicott, his collaborator of many years, says, “He got very inv.ved with issues, with ideas, and with questions. At times he was unaware of how people were responding to him or to the issue. He was surprised when he learned that someone was annoyed. He’d say, ‘Why was he annoyed? What’d I do?’” After years of confrontations, Spitzer is now aware of this shortcoming, and says that he struggles with it in his everyday life. “I find it very hard to give presents,” he says. “I never know what to give. A lot of people, they can see something and say, ‘Oh, that person would like that.’ But that just doesn’t happen to me. It’s not that I’m stingy. I’m just not able to project what they would like.” Frances argues that Spitzer’s emotional myopia has benefitted him in his chosen career: “He doesn’t understand people’s emotions. He knows he doesn’t. But that’s actually helpful in labeling symptoms. It provides less noise.”2

If this is correct, my argument about the implausibility of the Chair of the Nomenclature Committee attending Socarides' speech in New York without expectation of a demonstration may be wrong. I leave it in, because a student playing the part needs to think himself or herself into Spitzer's position, not his particular characteristics—and whatever unique mind Robert Spitzer has, it is probably uncommon in undergraduates.

##### Spitzer Task force

 See ch 3 of  Kutchins &amp; Kirk (2003) Making Us Crazy.  

Homdysphilia was proposed by Spitzer without consultation with the subcommittee on human sexuality.  Green sent Spitzer a strongly worded criticism of both the classification and the method Sptizer used to introduce it and resigns in protest.  Spitzer constructs a 'survey' instrument that he sends out to the entire taskforce and finds that there isn't enough agreement on the issue to leave it with the subcommittee, and presents the idea to the entire taskforce, thus outmaneuvering Green. The committee narrowly approves 'ego-dystonic homosexuality', but isn't thrilled. Judd Marmor, who voted in favor, writes later that he would have preferred no mention of homosexuality, but politics required it.

##### Averson Therapy

(from wikipedia) Since 1994, the American Psychological Association has declared that aversion therapy is a dangerous practice that does not work.[citation needed] Since 2006, the use of aversion therapy to treat homosexuality has been in violation of the codes of conduct and professional guidelines of the American Psychological Association and American Psychiatric Association. The use of aversion therapy to treat homosexuality is illegal in some countries. The standard in psychotherapy in America and Europe is currently Gay Affirmative Psychotherapy. Guidelines for Gay Affirmative Psychotherapy can be found by APA. [4]

From Issues in Psychotherapy with Lesbian and Gay Men: A Survey of Psychologists. Linda Garnets, Los Angeles, CA Kristin A. Hancock, Berkeley, CA Susan D. Cochran, California State University, Northridge Jacqueline Goodchilds, University of California, Los Angeles Letitia Anne Peplau, University of California, Los Angeles. Report of the APA. http://search.apa.org/search?facet=classification%3aSexuality||classification%3aTherapy&amp;query=Aversion%20Therapy

In 1975, the American Psychological Association (APA) took a strong stance regarding bias toward lesbians and gay men, resolving that homosexuality per se implies no impairment in judgment, reliability or general social and vocational abilities (see Appendix A for the full text of the resolution). The APA urged psychologists to take the lead in removing the stigma of mental illness long associated with homosexual orientations (Conger, 1975). In recent years, attention has been drawn to ways in which a client's ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, or physical disability can affect clinical judgment and treatment strategies. There has been a corresponding effort to develop guidelines to help practitioners avoid bias in psychotherapy (APA, 1975). Recognizing that practice does not spontaneously or quickly follow policy changes, the Committee on Lesbian and Gay Concerns (CLGC), sponsored jointly by the Board of Social and Ethical Responsibility in Psychology (BSERP) and the Board of Professional Affairs (BPA), formed a task force in 1984 to investigate the range of bias that may occur in psychotherapy with lesbians and gay men. This article is an abridged report of the task force's research, findings, and recommendations.

##### Reparative therapy

rejected repeatedly by the APA, most recently in 2008.

##### Evelyn Hooker

E. Hooker was given 1991 Award for Distinguished Contribution to Psychology in the Public Interest, presented by the American Psychological Association. The citation read:

"When homosexuals were considered to be mentally ill, were forced out of government jobs, and were arrested in police raids, Evelyn Hooker courageously sought and obtained research support from the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) to compare a matched sample of homosexual and heterosexual men. Her pioneering study, published in 1957, challenged the widespread belief that homosexuality is a pathology by demonstrating that experienced clinicians using psychological tests widely believed at the time to be appropriate could not identify the nonclinical homosexual group. This revolutionary study provided empirical evidence that normal homosexuals existed, and supported the radical idea then emerging that homosexuality is within the normal range of human behavior. Despite the stigma associated with homosexuality, she received an NIMH Research Career Award in 1961 to continue her work. In 1967, she became chair of the NIMH Task Force on Homosexuality, which provided a stamp of validation and research support for other major empirical studies. Her research, leadership, mentorship, and tireless advocacy for an accurate scientific view of homosexuality for more than three decades has been an outstanding contribution to psychology in the public interest."

The gamemaster's central responsibility will be to ensure that the conferences run smoothly.  The gamemaster must therefore maintain a robust relationship with the program committee.  In a small class, the gamemaster may prefer to the responsibilities of the program committee for himself or herself.

* Act as secretary to the Board of Directors if there is no preceptor available.
* Remind / cajole the program committee to prepare the schedule at least 48 hours in advance of each class.
* Maintain the election cycle (see the table in the instructor's manual)
* Distribute research reports were appropriate.

            <Text> While there is a great deal to prepare for this game, my experience has taught me that the largest challenge the students will face is understanding that psychology and psychiatry were not always as they are now presented.  Most students come to the game believing that (a) psychology is a science and (b) psychiatry is a medical practice.  Both of those claims were not settled in the public mind in 1970.  In fact, most of the tension in this game revolves around the efforts to make psychiatry conform to 'the medical model' and psychology conform to the model of the natural sciences, thereby legitimizing them as worthwhile endeavors.

Psychology, on the other hand, had been suffering a crisis of legitimacy since its inception, which is why so many of their arguments are really metatheoretical arguments on the nature of science.  The behaviorists believe that introducing new methodologies, like the cognitivists propose, would further weaken their claims to be a scientific discipline. 

Generally speaking, our students come to psychology and psychiatry through textbooks. And as a result, they are primed to believe, unreflectively, that contemporary narrative of these disciplines is settled fact. Furthermore, these students know nothing of the rise and regularization of health insurance companies and billing procedures following the inception of Medicare and Medicade in 1965. For them, managed care, billable hours and check-box diagnoses have always been a part of their medical experience. It was not in 1970. Since the 1970s, the psychiatrists and clinical psychologists have been under extraordinary pressure to create a system of diagnosis that will allow them to be compensated for their work under this system. Spitzer's shift from etiological psychiatry to descriptive psychiatry was a major salvo in that struggle. 

It is difficult to get them to feel the pressure to legitimize psychiatry and psychology that drove much of the work in this era. But one can make progress by explicitly emphasizing the crisis of legitimacy before beginning the game.

Many of the stories of this period—especially those from the members of the Spitzer task force—recall a time of great confusion. Spitzer is often characterized as acting almost singlehandedly, ignoring the hard work that others put into the classifications they proposed. If students feel confused and overwhelmed with all of the proposals being brought forward and the changes being made, that is partially intentional. 

While I believe that the removal of homosexuality was the correct decision, both morally and scientifically, that does not mean that the dissenters who point out the political bullying that went into passing the resolutions do not have a point. I want the students to come away with the sense that this period in the history of psychology and psychiatry was an all out scramble for legitimacy. Creating a sense of confusion and chaos is a necessary part of that environment.

### Your Biography
#### Charles Socarides' Biography
When you were 13, you read a biography of Sigmund Freud and immediately decided to become a psychoanalyst. You were trained in Psychoanalytic Medicine Columbia University Center for Psychoanalytic Training and Research, graduating in 1952.
You have been practicing psychoanalysis in New York City since 1954, focusing on the treatment of homosexuality. You report that 'about a third' of your patients became heterosexual after psychoanalytic treatment. Following Freud, you believe that homosexuality is a neurotic adaptation to unresolved conflict, usually originating in the Oedipal stage of development.  You do not argue that homosexuality is immoral in the sense of 'against god's will' or anything like that, you simply believe that it is a maladapation to normal development. You actually see yourself as an advocate for homosexuals, for you do not believe homosexuality is criminal or immoral, you believe it an illness like any other.
According to a 1995 interview in the NY Times “Socarides offered the closest thing to hope that many gay people had in the 1960s: the prospect of a cure. Rather than brand them as immoral or regard them as criminal, Socarides told gay people that they suffered from an illness whose effects could be reversed.”
#### Irving Bieber's Biography
You were born in New York City in 1909. You graduated from New York University Medical College in 1930, but went on to work at Yale Medical College, New York University, and starting in 1953 at the New York Medical College, where you taught a course in psychoanalysis.  Your 1962 book Homosexuality: A Psychoanalytic Study of Male Homosexuals is, in many ways, a response to the Kinsey Report. It reports on you study of 106 male homosexuals and 100 male heterosexuals seeking psychoanalysis for various problems.
In 1970, you attended a meeting of the American Psychiatric Association in San Francisco that was disrupted by gay activists, one of whom called you a "motherfucker." According to Charles Socarides, you took this very hard after having "been working all these years to help these people." In 1973, you told an interviewer that "a homosexual is a person whose heterosexual function is crippled, like the legs of a polio victim." You believed that, "although this change may be more easily accomplished by some than by others, in our judgment a heterosexual shift is a possibility for all homosexuals who are strongly motivated to change.”
### Your View
You are a Freudian, through and through. But more than that, you are a leader in the psychoanalytic treatment of homosexuality.  Your theory, that male homosexuality resulted from suppressed feelings of rejection caused by a cold, distant father and a misidentification of gender identity because of an overbearing mother, is orthodoxy.  Not only has it become  the popular notion of homosexuality in the public discourse, but it informs dominate treatment paradigm in the psychoanalytic community.
It is not, however, Freud's view.  Your theory is 'Freudian,' not Freud.  And it is worth pointing out that the theoretical explanation and treatment paradigms for homosexuality are different in England and Europe.
Freud mentions homosexuality a number of places in Introductory Lectures on Psychoanalysis, and it is crucially important that you study these carefully.  Freud believes that sexual life of children, which is regarded at the time as 'normal' includes a number of activities that would later in life be viewed as 'perverse', including same-sex contact.  In Freud's theory, heterosexuality develops with puberty in normal people. In 'inverts' or homosexuals, something goes wrong in this development. The object of ones' 'natural' desire--the genitals of the opposite sex—becomes transformed into parts of the body that represent those parts in the same sex.  Thus, homosexuality is no different in psychological mechanism than a foot fetish or any other neurotic 'perversion' (see p. 376-384 of Introductory Lectures) Homosexuality is not a psychologically isolated condition. According to Freud:
“We are compelled, however, to regard the choice of an object of one's own sex as a divergence in erotic life which is of positively habitual occurrence, and we are learning more and more to ascribe an especially high importance to it.” (p. 381)
In short, homosexuality is a kind of neurosis, yet it is not, itself, particularly worrying. The action itself is merely 'habitual,' and hence can be cured through standard habit-blocking therapy (Freud suggests that paranoia stops homosexuality on p. 381 of the Introductory Lectures).  It is, however, invariably an indicator of deeper psychological problems, as the transference and substitution of the 'natural' object of sexual desire to a different object will cause neurosis. See Ch 26 of the Introductory Lectures, especially p. 530, for Freud's explanation of homosexuality as neurotic narcissism.
For you, Bieber and Socarides, this theory is transformed somewhat.  You argue, in your 1962 study Homosexuality, that the normal course of development of puberty includes the identification of genders with innate 'active or passive tendencies' (p 4), and then self-identification with one of those tendencies. If a child has an innate tendency towards activity or passivity out of line with his or her gender, he or she is more likely to develop 'homosexual habits'.
At the same time, if an adolescent develops a pathological fear of heterosexual contact—specifically a fear of the gentiles of the opposite sex—that subconscious fear will motivate the ego to transform the object of sexual desire into something that is familiar: a part of the adolescent's own body. These fear are usually the result of some disturbed parent-child relationship. Just as the Oedipal phase is a normal part of development, fear of the opposite sex is a normal part of development. Heterosexuals are those for whom those fears resolve through maturation.
Homosexuals are, then, those who never fully mature in their sexuality, getting stuck at a stage where children are fearful of the other and fascinated with their own bodies. They pathologically project that self-love onto members of their own gender, instead of resolving their fears through heterosexual exploration.
You characterize Freud's theory of the development of homosexuality in three steps:
1.	The autoerotic phase partially persists and object cathexis is partially accomplished, but on a narcissistic level.
2.	Mental attitudes that exist during the phallic stage remain into adulthood.
3.	There are difficulties associated with the Oedipus phase.
It is worth noting that Bieber's analysis was only of male homosexuality.  Freud wrote one study of Lesbianism, which is included in the appendix of the game book.
Regardless of the particulars of your or Freud's view, you are absolutely committed to the thesis that
“All psychoanalytic theories assume that adult homosexuality is psychopathologic and assign differing weights to constitutional and experiential determinants. All agree that experiential determinants are in the main rooted in childhood and are primarily related to the family. Theories which do not assume psychopathology hold homosexuality to be one type of expression of a polymorphous sexuality which appears pathologic only in cultures holding it to be so.” (p 18)
### Game Objectives
Complicating matters somewhat, you (Bieber) were once classmates with Judd Marmor!  You were friends then, and that personal relationship may be at stake in this debate.
During your presentations, you must be able to both articulate the current psychoanalytic understanding of homosexuality and its connection to Freud's theory as presented in Introductory Lectures on Psychoanalysis.  You should also be ready to present any evidence that you may have that this theory is accurate.  You'll find that evidence in Ch 2 Bieber's 1962 book, listed under 'Must Read' below.   The first chapter contains Biebers' critiques of the Kinsey study (p. 16), Hooker's study (p. 17),  as well as the movement to declassify homosexuality as a mental illness in the UK (p. 15).
Your theory is summarized in Ch 9 of your 1962 book:
We consider Homosexuality to be pathologic bio-social, psychosexual adaptation to pervasive fears surrounding the expression of heterosexual impulses. In our view, every homosexual is, in reality, a “latent” heterosexual; hence we expected to find evidences of heterosexual strivings among the H-patients in our study.  (p. 220)
As a student, we leave it to you to decide if the evidence presented therein is sufficient motivation for the theoretical mechanism you are proposing.
 As the character, you have to make the best case you can for your position – the audience will determine if the evidence you present motivates the mechanism you defend. You have few, if any, friends in this effort.  We're sorry about that, but it is historically accurate. Marmor and Spiegel have  begun to be successful in separating psychoanalysis from your views on homosexuality. Your job in this game, then, is to advocate for a position that is almost certainly going to lose.  
While you need to make your case, you might want to put most of your energy focusing on something you can win: continuing the dominance of psychoanalysis in psychiatry and allowing treatment for individuals who see therapy for homosexuality voluntarily. The DSM often determines which conditions a therapist can treat in a clinical setting, or get funding to study scientifically. If 'homosexuality' is removed entirely, no one in psychiatry will be allowed to help individuals seeking treatment, or conduct scientific research into homosexuality. Those consequences are things you cannot live with.  
Look back at the definition of 'psychic illness' presented by Freud in Introductory Lectures (p. 445, but quoted in the gamebook 'History of Mental Illness: Freud' section.  For Freud (and Freudians), a psychic illness is something detrimental to one's life as a whole, something that the patient complains about, or that brings the patient displeasure.  Removing homosexuality from the list of mental illness will likely not change these facts for your patients, but you will no longer be allowed to treat them—and that seems to go against your oath as a medical doctor.
If the proposal from Marmor comes to the floor in 1971, present a proposal to stall the vote until after a taskforce conducts a literature review on the efficacy of treatment for homosexuality. You will request total control of that task force, including appointing its members. If you are successful, you will appoint yourself and yourself (Socarides and Bieber).  
You report should present aversion therapy as an effective method for stopping homosexual behavior. This is something of a anachronism for the sake of the game, as Socarides and Bieber were psychoanalysts.  But it's use was widespread in the treatment of homosexuality at the time, and you are the most famous defender of the medicalization of homosexuality.
If you are unsuccessful in getting the taskforce, you can join with Albee in his call for an ad hoc committee to be formed to study the history of the homosexuality in psychology and psychiatry. You're goal here is to make it acceptable to continue to treat homosexuals if they request it, even if it homosexuality itself was not considered a mental illness.
If it looks like the vote to remove homosexuality will pass in 1973 (and it almost certainly will), start collecting 'signatures' on a petition calling for the abdication of that vote, on the grounds that the decision was political (i.e. the board caved to the demands of the activists) and not scientific. If you can get 10% of the class to sign, you may be able to force a postponement or revote.
If the 'Leona Tyler' principle passes in 1973, banning the APA from making taking public positions on things not motivated by evidence, reintroduce your proposals, arguing that the removal of homosexuality was on the basis of politics, not science. If none of this works and 'homosexuality' is removed, and research and treatment of homosexuality is banned by the APA,  quit (in 1975) and found your own private organization called 'NARTH': North American association for Research and Therapy on Homosexuality (as a student, look it up).
Finally, when and if the game gets to a point where the APA attempts to create a definition of ‘mental illness’, work to get a psychoanalytic version passed.  You must also advocate for a theory of mental illness that takes into account the 'natural function' of a body.  Recall Freud's criteria for neurosis: if an individual's psychology is out of step with their biology, it will cause that individual to always be unfulfilled, and hence, will be detrimental to their overall outlook.  A healthy person is one who recognizes his or her own physical function and seeks a life in accordance with those functions.
#### Specific Assignments
Propose a taskforce to study sexual deviation in 1971, which will report back to the membership in 1973. Your report should summarize and present your Freudian view carefully.
R. Green and J. Spiegel will likely propose a taskforce on the history of homosexuality in psychiatry and psychology that will report in 1972. You should be ready to give an 'official' response to this report.  Marmor probably will as well, so be prepared for a  head-to-head debate in public.
SECRET: you are bound by patient-client confidentiality.  Your patients are not.  This is particularly difficult because many of the street activists who are disrupting meetings are your former patients. No one (other than them) can know that. By your best estimates, your therapy is effective only about 1/3 of the time. Many of your patients are brought to you by their parents. In a classic transference reaction, their anger against their parents is transferred to you, and drives them to classic father-rebellion activities after therapy ends.  
One in particular: Ron Gold, has you concerned. Ron is now a journalist for Variety, and you saw him at the incident in New York arguing with Robert Spitzer. Ron Gold may not be a character, depending on the size of the class.
DSM III: Vehemently oppose any attempt to remove psychoanalytic language from the DSM.

Fission: split to the American Psychoanalytic Association (APsaA).

##### John P. Spiegel, MD  Director, Lemberg Center for the Study of Violence, Brandeis University

World-famous for his study of combat fatigue, co-authored with Dr. Roy Grinker in the 1945 book Men Under Stress.  Grinker and Spiegel argued, quite persuasively, that combat fatigue was not a result of a character flaw, but rather the social circumstances of war. It should, therefore, be treated, not punished. Spiegel is a former president of the American Academy of Psychoanalysis.

Initial member of the nomenclature committee, term expiring 1974.

#### Behaviorists

##### Albert Bandura, PhD  Professor of Psychology, Stanford
Initially serving the APA as Vice president (or President-elect) of the APA in 1971, will become president in 1972. He is therefore an initial member of the board of directors.

Bandura was trained in Behaviorism while at the University of Iowa, where Hull's advocate Spense taught. He was not, however, attracted to the strict mathematical-deductive model proposed by Hull, tending towards the work of Tolman.  After graduating Iowa, he went west to work with other like-minded Tolman followers. Currently, Bandura is a Professor of Psychology at Stanford University. His work on 'social learning,' which was started by his 'bobo-doll' studies, is widely known. Many expect his presidential address in 1972 to both explain his notion of 'vicarious reinforcement,' and articulate the relationship between his behavioristic approach and Miller's new 'cognitive psychology'.

Bandura was elected as a Fellow of the APA in 1964.

##### Harry Harlow, PhD Professor of Psychology, University of Wisconsin

Initially 'former' president, serving on the board of directors.

Harlow is most well known for his series of experiments on separation anxiety in baby rhesus monkeys, Harry Harlow has become one of the most important advocates for behaviorism in the APA today.  Harlow's primate lab at the University of Wisconsin is widely recognized as one of the top places for training young researchers in experimental psychology.  Harlow won the Society for Experimental Psychology's Howard Crosby Warren medal in 1956 and the National Medal of Science in 1967.  He served as President of the APA in 1970.

##### Evelyn Hooker, PhD  Emeritus Professor of Psychology, UCLA 

Evelyn Hooker studied with Karl Meunzinger and Robert Yerkes, pioneers in the fields of animal behavior. Starting in the 1950s, Hooker became interested in human sexuality. In 1953, she won a grant from the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) to study the mental health of 'non-patient, non-inmate homosexuals'.  Hooker showed that if homosexuality itself were removed from the diagnostic information, homosexual men were no more likely to be diagnosed as 'neurotic' than heterosexual men.

On the program for the first class with Dr. H. Anonymous as a panelist on the topic 'Psychiatry: Friend or Foe to Homosexuals: A Dialogue'

Initial member of the Program committee, term expiring 1972.

#### Cognitivists

##### Noam Chomsky, PhD Professor of Linguistics, MIT

In 1971, Noam Chomsky is a quickly rising star in the academy. Currently a professor of Linguistics at MIT, his work is revolutionizing the field, changing the very idea of linguistics from the descriptive study of existing languages to the understanding of how languages result from formal (logical) rules. Chomsky is also a harsh critic of Skinner's radical behaviorism. His review of Skinner's 'Verbal Behavior' is widely seen as a devastating blow to behaviorism. It is contained in the appendix.

##### George Miller, PhD Professor of Psychology, Harvard 

President of the APA in 1971. When the game begins, Miller is serving on the board of directors and responsible for the Presidential address to open the first game session. Miller was trained in behaviorism, but, in part because of his friendship with Chomsky, has developed a new approach he calls 'Cognitive Psychology.' Miller has a side interest in the history of psychology, having worked with E.G. Boring and authored Psychology: the science of mental life.

#### Independents

##### George W. Albee, PhD Professor of Psychology, University of Vermont (Psychologist)

Clinical Psychologist.  Albee worked as the executive secretary for the APA from 1951-1953, along side Harry Harlow's wife. Many of the committee structures and procedures followed today were actually refined by Albee during his time as secretary.In the 1950s, he chaired a task force to survey the resources available to mental heath professionals. The astonishing clarity of the resulting report, along with Albee's unwavering commitment to preventative mental health practices caused a great stir in psychiatric and psychological circles.

Author of 'A declaration of independence for psychology' (1964), Albee is a major figure in the often 'acrimonious' debate regarding the suitability of the medical model for understanding mental illness. If any questions arise regarding the APA's decision-making procedures, Albee is the person to ask.  He has held every position of responsibility in the organization save the Presidency and Vice-Presidency.

Initial member of the nomenclature committee, term expiring 1972. In classes over 16, also 'member at large' for the board of directors starting in 1971.

##### Kenneth Clark, PhD Professor of Psychology, CCNY (psychologist)

Kenneth Clark, along with his wife  Mamie Phipps Clark, are the authors of a hugely famous study of the racial attitudes of young children. Ken and Mamie presented four identical plastic dolls that different only with respect to color to black children between the ages of three and seven. When asked which doll they preferred, the majority selected the white doll. When asked to color in a drawing 'the same color' as themselves, most of the black children choose yellow or white crayons. Ken Clark testified as an expert in three of the five cases that were combined into the landmark school desegregation decision Brown v. The Board of Education, and his summary was cited by Chief Justice Warren (footnote 11) as influencing the court's decision.

If the game master chooses, he or she may introduce or encourage the development of a compromise position like the DSM-IV: 

&gt;… although this manual provides a classification of mental disorders, it must be admitted that no definition adequately specifies precise boundaries for the concept of ‘mental disorder.’ The concept of mental disorder, like many other concepts in medicine and science, lacks a consistent operational definition that covers all situations. All medical conditions are defined on various levels of abstraction--for example, structural pathology (e.g., ulcerative colitis), symptom presentation (e.g., migraine), deviance from a physiological norm (e.g., hypertension), and etiology (e.g., pneumococcal pneumonia). Mental disorders have also been defined by a variety of concepts (e.g., distress, dyscontrol, disadvantage, disability, inflexibility, irrationality, syndromal pattern, etiology, and statistical deviation). Each is a useful indicator for a mental disorder, but none is equivalent to the concept, and different situations call for different definitions.” 

With something like the 7 part definition included there in:

*Features*
	&gt;A a clinically significant behavioral or psychological syndrome or pattern that occurs in an individual

	&gt;B is associated with present distress (e.g., a painful symptom) or disability (i.e., impairment in one or more important areas of functioning) or with a significantly increased risk of suffering death, pain, disability, or an important loss of freedom

	&gt;C must not be merely an expeMillctable and culturally sanctioned response to a particular event, for example, the death of a loved one

	&gt;D a manifestation of a behavioral, psychological, or biological dysfunction in the individual

	&gt;E neither deviant behavior (e.g., political, religious, or sexual) nor conflicts that are primarily between the individual and society are mental disorders unless the deviance or conflict is a symptom of a dysfunction in the individual

*Other Considerations*
	&gt;F no definition adequately specifies precise boundaries for the concept of “mental disorder”
	&gt;G the concept of mental disorder (like many other concepts in medicine and science) lacks a consistent operational definition that covers all situations

#### Emotional responses in a human child.
##### Background: 
Many psychologists--Freud included--have held, with little evidence in support, that the human mind is built on a variety of instincts, such as self-preservation, sexual activity, etc. Emotional responses to fearful stimuli, such as rats and spiders, is commonly considered to be innate, possibly as a result of evolutionary pressures to avoid infectious or poisonous creatures.  This experiment seeks to condition a fear-response in a human infant, thus establishing that there is no need for theoretical innate entities in our explanation of emotion in humans.

##### Rationale: 
The success of Pavlov's work conditioning reflex responses to novel stimuli in canines has shown that behaviors previously believed to be instinctual are likely to have resulted from conditioning.  The current experiment seeks to determine if that insight can be extended to humans, by conditioning a emotional response in a child—fear—that is widely believed to be instinctual. Demonstrating that these reflexes can appear without appeal to 'instinct' or 'adaptation' undermines the need for theoretically innate entities in our understanding of human behavior.

##### Experimental Design: 
A child of a single destitute mother, currently employed as a wet nurse at a local hospital (Hopkins), has been recruited for the experiment. Given the nature of his mother's employment, the child is familiar with the clinical setting of a hospital, and hence an ideal subject for this experimental protocol. Previous work with this subject at the age of 8 months has demonstrated that he exhibits fear-like responses to loud sounds: the experimenter stood behind the subject, outside of eye sight and struck a steel bar with a hammer. On the first presentation, the subject startled and raised his hands. On the second, he began to tremble. On the third, he cried and seemed to be having a fit.

The experimenter proposes the following:

At 9 months of age, we will present the subject with (randomly): a white rat, a rabbit, a dog, a monkey, with masks with and without hair, cotton wool, and burning newspapers. Given the child's upbringing, it is unlikely that he has ever encountered any of these objects before.  We expect him to have no emotional response to any of them, but if he responds, that object will be removed from the study before proceeding.

At the age of 11 months, one of the objects will be presented to him again. When he moves towards contact with the object, the experimenter will make the loud noise already established as causing a fear reaction.  Each movement towards the stimulus object will cause another loud noise stimulus.  Once the fear reaction is well conditioned, the experimenter will present the subject with the fear-conditioned object and record the response.  The child's reaction than will be compared with other similarly-aged children's reaction for typicality of fear-reactions in children.

The fear-conditioned object will be reintroduced over the subsequent weeks and months at regular intervals to determine the persistence of the conditioned response. 

##### Significance and Contribution
This research has the potential to experimentally confirm or deny the commonly held belief that the fear response is innate, or at least instinctual. Pavlov's experiments with classical conditioning in dogs has shown that reflexes that were previously believed to be instinctual—such as salivation—could be conditioned in response to novel stimuli. If Pavlov's approach is to be applied to humans, it is incumbent that psychologists determine the existence and nature of human instinctual reactions, and if they can be conditioned like those of the canine.

            <Text>
#### Mental rotation of three-dimensional objects
##### Background: 
Mentally rotating 3-dimensional objects is one indicator of spatial reasoning in humans. And it is one that is tempting to explain in terms of internal mental imagery. The 'cognitive hypothesis' holds that in order to solve mental rotation problems, a cognitive representation of the presented object must be rotated in the mind before an identification can be made - and it is that hypothesis that we wish to test here.
##### Rationale: 
When asked to match three-dimensional objects presented in two-dimensional format, individuals report imagining the object in three-dimensions and rotating them mentally to test against the other possibilities. Introspective reports are, of course, notoriously difficult to address in a scientific way, but that does not mean that we cannot study the phenomenon. If individuals are manipulating mental representations, we would expect a measurable difference in reaction time given a matching task.
##### Experimental Design: 
A number of adult subjects (the size of the class) will presented with pairs of two-dimensional line drawings of three-dimensional blocks. Each subject will be asked to indicate as quickly as possible if the two were drawings of the same object rotated in space or different objects. Half of the experimental set will be rotated versions of the same object, the other half not. They will be presented to the subjects in random order. The time it takes to respond will be measured using computer software. We hypothesize that the amount of time necessary to respond will be correlated with the angle of rotation of the two objects, thus establishing the cognitive hypothesis.

#### On Being Sane in Insane Places

##### Background

However much mental health practitioners may be personally convinced that we can tell the normal from the abnormal, the evidence is simply not compelling. It is commonplace, for example, to read about murder trials wherein eminent psychiatrists for the defense are contradicted by equally eminent psychiatrists for the prosecution on the matter of the defendant's sanity. More generally, there are a great deal of conflicting data on the reliability, utility, and meaning of such terms as “sanity,” “insanity,” “mental illness” and “schizophrenia.” Finally, as early as 1934, Ruth Benedict suggested that normality and abnormality are not universal. What is viewed as normal in one culture may be seen as quite aberrant in another.

##### Rationale

How do we know precisely what constitutes “normality” or mental illness? Conventional wisdom suggests that specially trained professionals have the ability to make resolably accurate diagnoses. In this research, however, we intend to challenge that assumption. What is—and what is not-- “normal” may have to do with the labels that are applied to people in particular settings.

##### Experimental Design

Eight sane people, of varied backgrounds, will gain secret admission to 12 different hospitals, from varied geographical regions of the United States. Their diagnostic experiences will constitute the data of the of the study.  The 'pseudopatients' will call the hospital for an appointment, complaining of 'hearing voices.' When asked what the voices said, they will reply that it was unclear, but that they were 'empty,' 'hollow,' and 'thud.'  The pseudopatients will report that voices were unfamiliar and in the same gender as the pseudopatient. After admission to the psychiatric ward, the pseudopatient will cease simulating symptoms of abnormality.  

The amount of time it takes for the pseudopatient to be released, along with any diagnoses and treatments, will be recorded.

##### Significance and Contributions

This study provides and opportunity to test the reliability of psychiatric diagnosis in the 'real world,' rather than the controlled environment of a university lab.  The hospital environment imposes a special environment on its members in which the actions of a normal person could be misinterpreted as 'insane' or 'abnormal.'  This study will determine the extent of that influence on psychiatric diagnosis.

### Your Biography
#### Irving Bieber's Biography
You were born in New York City in 1909. You graduated from New York University Medical College in 1930, but went on to work at Yale Medical College, New York University, and starting in 1953 at the New York Medical College, where you taught a course in psychoanalysis.  Your 1962 book Homosexuality: A Psychoanalytic Study of Male Homosexuals is, in many ways, a response to the Kinsey Report. It reports on you study of 106 male homosexuals and 100 male heterosexuals seeking psychoanalysis for various problems.
In 1970, you attended a meeting of the American Psychiatric Association in San Francisco that was disrupted by gay activists, one of whom called you a "motherfucker." According to Charles Socarides, you took this very hard after having "been working all these years to help these people." In 1973, you told an interviewer that "a homosexual is a person whose heterosexual function is crippled, like the legs of a polio victim." You believed that, "although this change may be more easily accomplished by some than by others, in our judgment a heterosexual shift is a possibility for all homosexuals who are strongly motivated to change.”
Your View
You are a Freudian, through and through. But more than that, you are a leader in the psychoanalytic treatment of homosexuality.  Your theory, that male homosexuality resulted from suppressed feelings of rejection caused by a cold, distant father and a misidentification of gender identity because of an overbearing mother, is orthodoxy.  Not only has it become  the popular notion of homosexuality in the public discourse, but it informs dominate treatment paradigm in the psychoanalytic community.
It is not, however, Freud's view.  Your theory is 'Freudian,' not Freud.  And it is worth pointing out that the theoretical explanation and treatment paradigms for homosexuality are different in England and Europe.
Freud mentions homosexuality a number of places in Introductory Lectures on Psychoanalysis, and it is crucially important that you study these carefully.  Freud believes that sexual life of children, which is regarded at the time as 'normal' includes a number of activities that would later in life be viewed as 'perverse', including same-sex contact.  In Freud's theory, heterosexuality develops with puberty in normal people. In 'inverts' or homosexuals, something goes wrong in this development. The object of ones' 'natural' desire--the genitals of the opposite sex—becomes transformed into parts of the body that represent those parts in the same sex.  Thus, homosexuality is no different in psychological mechanism than a foot fetish or any other neurotic 'perversion' (see p. 376-384 of Introductory Lectures) Homosexuality is not a psychologically isolated condition. According to Freud:
“We are compelled, however, to regard the choice of an object of one's own sex as a divergence in erotic life which is of positively habitual occurrence, and we are learning more and more to ascribe an especially high importance to it.” (p. 381)
In short, homosexuality is a kind of neurosis, yet it is not, itself, particularly worrying. The action itself is merely 'habitual,' and hence can be cured through standard habit-blocking therapy (Freud suggests that paranoia stops homosexuality on p. 381 of the Introductory Lectures).  It is, however, invariably an indicator of deeper psychological problems, as the transference and substitution of the 'natural' object of sexual desire to a different object will cause neurosis. See Ch 26 of the Introductory Lectures, especially p. 530, for Freud's explanation of homosexuality as neurotic narcissism.
For you, Bieber and Socarides, this theory is transformed somewhat.  You argue, in your 1962 study Homosexuality, that the normal course of development of puberty includes the identification of genders with innate 'active or passive tendencies' (p 4), and then self-identification with one of those tendencies. If a child has an innate tendency towards activity or passivity out of line with his or her gender, he or she is more likely to develop 'homosexual habits'.
At the same time, if an adolescent develops a pathological fear of heterosexual contact—specifically a fear of the gentiles of the opposite sex—that subconscious fear will motivate the ego to transform the object of sexual desire into something that is familiar: a part of the adolescent's own body. These fear are usually the result of some disturbed parent-child relationship. Just as the Oedipal phase is a normal part of development, fear of the opposite sex is a normal part of development. Heterosexuals are those for whom those fears resolve through maturation.
Homosexuals are, then, those who never fully mature in their sexuality, getting stuck at a stage where children are fearful of the other and fascinated with their own bodies. They pathologically project that self-love onto members of their own gender, instead of resolving their fears through heterosexual exploration.
You characterize Freud's theory of the development of homosexuality in three steps:
1.	The autoerotic phase partially persists and object cathexis is partially accomplished, but on a narcissistic level.
2.	Mental attitudes that exist during the phallic stage remain into adulthood.
3.	There are difficulties associated with the Oedipus phase.
It is worth noting that Bieber's analysis was only of male homosexuality.  Freud wrote one study of Lesbianism, which is included in the appendix of the game book.
Regardless of the particulars of your or Freud's view, you are absolutely committed to the thesis that
“All psychoanalytic theories assume that adult homosexuality is psychopathologic and assign differing weights to constitutional and experiential determinants. All agree that experiential determinants are in the main rooted in childhood and are primarily related to the family. Theories which do not assume psychopathology hold homosexuality to be one type of expression of a polymorphous sexuality which appears pathologic only in cultures holding it to be so.” (p 18)
### Game Objectives
Complicating matters somewhat, you (Bieber) were once classmates with Judd Marmor!  You were friends then, and that personal relationship may be at stake in this debate.
During your presentations, you must be able to both articulate the current psychoanalytic understanding of homosexuality and its connection to Freud's theory as presented in Introductory Lectures on Psychoanalysis.  You should also be ready to present any evidence that you may have that this theory is accurate.  You'll find that evidence in Ch 2 Bieber's 1962 book, listed under 'Must Read' below.   The first chapter contains Biebers' critiques of the Kinsey study (p. 16), Hooker's study (p. 17),  as well as the movement to declassify homosexuality as a mental illness in the UK (p. 15).
Your theory is summarized in Ch 9 of your 1962 book:
We consider Homosexuality to be pathologic bio-social, psychosexual adaptation to pervasive fears surrounding the expression of heterosexual impulses. In our view, every homosexual is, in reality, a “latent” heterosexual; hence we expected to find evidences of heterosexual strivings among the H-patients in our study.  (p. 220)
As a student, we leave it to you to decide if the evidence presented therein is sufficient motivation for the theoretical mechanism you are proposing.
 As the character, you have to make the best case you can for your position – the audience will determine if the evidence you present motivates the mechanism you defend. You have few, if any, friends in this effort.  We're sorry about that, but it is historically accurate. Marmor and Spiegel have  begun to be successful in separating psychoanalysis from your views on homosexuality. Your job in this game, then, is to advocate for a position that is almost certainly going to lose.  
While you need to make your case, you might want to put most of your energy focusing on something you can win: continuing the dominance of psychoanalysis in psychiatry and allowing treatment for individuals who see therapy for homosexuality voluntarily. The DSM often determines which conditions a therapist can treat in a clinical setting, or get funding to study scientifically. If 'homosexuality' is removed entirely, no one in psychiatry will be allowed to help individuals seeking treatment, or conduct scientific research into homosexuality. Those consequences are things you cannot live with.  
Look back at the definition of 'psychic illness' presented by Freud in Introductory Lectures (p. 445, but quoted in the gamebook 'History of Mental Illness: Freud' section.  For Freud (and Freudians), a psychic illness is something detrimental to one's life as a whole, something that the patient complains about, or that brings the patient displeasure.  Removing homosexuality from the list of mental illness will likely not change these facts for your patients, but you will no longer be allowed to treat them—and that seems to go against your oath as a medical doctor.
If the proposal from Marmor comes to the floor in 1971, present a proposal to stall the vote until after a taskforce conducts a literature review on the efficacy of treatment for homosexuality. You will request total control of that task force, including appointing its members. If you are successful, you will appoint yourself and yourself (Socarides and Bieber).  
You report should present aversion therapy as an effective method for stopping homosexual behavior. This is something of a anachronism for the sake of the game, as Socarides and Bieber were psychoanalysts.  But it's use was widespread in the treatment of homosexuality at the time, and you are the most famous defender of the medicalization of homosexuality.
If you are unsuccessful in getting the taskforce, you can join with Albee in his call for an ad hoc committee to be formed to study the history of the homosexuality in psychology and psychiatry. You're goal here is to make it acceptable to continue to treat homosexuals if they request it, even if it homosexuality itself was not considered a mental illness.
If it looks like the vote to remove homosexuality will pass in 1973 (and it almost certainly will), start collecting 'signatures' on a petition calling for the abdication of that vote, on the grounds that the decision was political (i.e. the board caved to the demands of the activists) and not scientific. If you can get 10% of the class to sign, you may be able to force a postponement or revote.
If the 'Leona Tyler' principle passes in 1973, banning the APA from making taking public positions on things not motivated by evidence, reintroduce your proposals, arguing that the removal of homosexuality was on the basis of politics, not science. If none of this works and 'homosexuality' is removed, and research and treatment of homosexuality is banned by the APA,  quit (in 1975) and found your own private organization called 'NARTH': North American association for Research and Therapy on Homosexuality (as a student, look it up).
Finally, when and if the game gets to a point where the APA attempts to create a definition of ‘mental illness’, work to get a psychoanalytic version passed.  You must also advocate for a theory of mental illness that takes into account the 'natural function' of a body.  Recall Freud's criteria for neurosis: if an individual's psychology is out of step with their biology, it will cause that individual to always be unfulfilled, and hence, will be detrimental to their overall outlook.  A healthy person is one who recognizes his or her own physical function and seeks a life in accordance with those functions.
#### Specific Assignments
Propose a taskforce to study sexual deviation in 1971, which will report back to the membership in 1973. Your report should summarize and present your Freudian view carefully.
R. Green and J. Spiegel will likely propose a taskforce on the history of homosexuality in psychiatry and psychology that will report in 1972. You should be ready to give an 'official' response to this report.  Marmor probably will as well, so be prepared for a  head-to-head debate in public.
SECRET: you are bound by patient-client confidentiality.  Your patients are not.  This is particularly difficult because many of the street activists who are disrupting meetings are your former patients. No one (other than them) can know that. By your best estimates, your therapy is effective only about 1/3 of the time. Many of your patients are brought to you by their parents. In a classic transference reaction, their anger against their parents is transferred to you, and drives them to classic father-rebellion activities after therapy ends.  
One in particular: Ron Gold, has you concerned. Ron is now a journalist for Variety, and you saw him at the incident in New York arguing with Robert Spitzer. Ron Gold may not be a character, depending on the size of the class.
DSM III: Vehemently oppose any attempt to remove psychoanalytic language from the DSM.

Fission: split to the American Psychoanalytic Association (APsaA).

            <Text>#### Voting

I've left the issue of membership in the APA, and the right to vote on many of the main issues, intentionally vague. This is to allow for some flexibility for the instructor. The issue of who can practice mental health treatment is a game issue, realized in competing proposals in 1973.  As a corrollary then, the issue of membership in the APA may be brought forward. This can also play out as one of the causes of the great 'fission' that may occur starting in 1975.

The characters effected are Kameny, Gittings and Gold, who are not members of the APA.  If the gamemaster wants everyone to vote, he or she should make clear from the beginning that they are considered to be members of the APA with full rights to vote.

### Your Biography
You are Evelyn Hooker, legend in the field of the psychology of human sexuality. In 1991, The APA  publicly recognizing you with an award for Distinguished Contribution in the Public Interest from the American Psychological Association. Your acceptance speech detailed your most famous study, and how it came to be. This is a rare case for a 'Reacting' character, so please excuse us as we quote it in length. It is far more detailed that we would ever be able to piece together from other sources.
When you received the APA’s award for Distinguished Contribution in the Public Interest in August 1992, you made a speech, which covered this part of the history of the APA.  A long excerpt from that speech is included here for your character development.  Do not quote or even paraphrase this speech in the course of the game - this is here are a primary source for you to understand your character’s biography and experiences during this period.

In 1953, when I applied for a six-month grant from the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) to study nonpatient, nonprisoner homosexuals, I had no intention of starting a new career. What I did not fully anticipate was the wealth of research demands and opportunities, the lively interest and cooperation of the gay community, and the continued interest and offers of assistance from the Grants Division of NIMH.
After I applied for the NIMH grant, the late John Eberhart came to UCLA to spend a day with me. It was clear that he wanted to see what and who I was. It was the height of the McCarthy era: Communists and homosexuals were the objects of destructive witch hunts. At the end of the day, Dr. Eberhard said "We are prepared to make you the grant, but you may not receive it. Everyone is being investigated. If you don't receive it, you won't know why and we won't know why."
I can only assume that either I was not investigated or that it was a slipshod investigation. In either case, why? My husband was a very distinguished professor of English at UCLA. In every way, he presented the characteristics of traditional values, but he fought very hard against the University of California loyalty oath, as had I. If the FBI had dug more deeply into my history, they would have found a first husband who drove an ambulance in the Spanish Civil War. If the question came to the FBI's attention at all, how did they interpret my interest in gay men? I will never know. If it was investigated, I did not know it.
Under the direction of Philip Sapir (who became chief of extramural grants when Dr. Eberhard left NIMH), I received a series of specific research grants until 1961, when I received a Research Career Award. During this time, Philip Sapir took a personal interest in my research, making the resources of his position available in incredible ways. For example, he invited me to give a lecture at NIMH especially for the research scientists, and afterward to spend three days in a seminar with a handpicked group of them. Because I worked alone, his moral, financial, and intellectual assistance became of the utmost importance. When I expressed my gratitude, he said that, in his position, he had general knowledge of many research projects and that it was very gratifying to know one in detail. It is highly probable that, without his interest and help, I would have stopped after the first major paper, and would not be here today.
The Role of Serendipity 	  	
As I reflect on the adverse conditions potentially threatening the successful pursuit of the goals of my research, I am impressed by the many serendipitous conditions that made the research possible. For example, a site visitor stressed the "fact" that members of the study committee would consider that I was working with psychopathology and that I must have a psychiatric consultant. With many reservations, I went to see the chair of the Psychiatry Department. When he asked about the research, I told him I was studying "normal male homosexuals." He rose from his chair and said, "What do you think you are doing? There is no such person." He then referred me to Frederic Worden, who had just come to the department. I let Dr. Worden read my application. He, then, turned to me and said, "I have never seen such persons, but I sure would like to." He became a valuable consultant.
A second perennially recurring situation was the demand of university officials that the research be conducted at the university. I resisted this demand because to have yielded would have meant the end. Not a single person would have come. The first absolute condition was secrecy and confidentiality. By great good fortune, our home was a very spacious estate of an acre of ground with a garden study separate from the house. It was there that the research was conducted. Once a person opened the garden gate, he was invisible to the neighbors. Without this superb place in which to conduct the research, I would never have attempted it.
The Imperative of Confidentiality
It will be obvious to you that the absolute sine qua non of research into behavior thought to be "a sin, a crime, and a disease" is confidentiality. Before I began the research, my friend Christopher Isherwood lived in the study for a while. If I asked him for a favor, he would often reply, "Yes, if you will keep me out of Norwalk." Norwalk is a California mental institution. The triple stigma was never far from the minds of the men whom I came to know nor was it far from mine.
The ramifications of confidentiality in this project were very extensive. A young gay man recently asked, "How did they know they could trust you?" The answer is, I don't know. Every testing and life history session was tape recorded. I assured each person that only my secretary would listen to them and after transcribing them would erase the tapes. Did they believe me? Yes, apparently so. One man who was nationally known by his books called me long distance at frequent intervals to ask whether his tapes had been erased.
One of my objectives was to understand each life as fully as possible, and thus to keep all of the personally identifying data for each man. This meant, in my view, that it would be impossible to share this highly confidential material with a co-worker. Building confidentiality with the gay community at that time was not an easy task. I could not lightly, if at all, share these confidences with another. Informal applications to be a coinvestigator were numerous, but I continued to work alone until the data gathering phase was complete.
Working alone in such a stress- and trauma-laden field inevitably entails high psychological costs. Without a colleague with whom to share the sympathetic knowledge of human suffering, sometimes one's own vicarious suffering becomes almost unbearable. This was especially true for me after my husband's death. I hasten to make clear that, when I characterize conducting research with gay men as stressful, I am only referring to the McCarthy era when the penalties were barbaric.
Even then, had I chosen just to remain in my study and let the gay men come to me, perhaps the stress would have been less. I could not settle for less. Instead, I accepted invitations to gay parties, gay organizations, gay after-hours clubs, and gay bars. I was convinced that, because of the secrecy imposed on gay men whose occupations and very lives were at risk if their identity became known, it was essential to know and understand everything I could about the gay social milieu that they created.
How it came to be known as the "gay world" remains a mystery to me. As I know it, however, the term in its generic meaning is, in part, justified. Camping, for example, is a dramatic form of behavior in both its high and low comic and tragic aspects. Perhaps an illustration will convey something of both. One evening at a dinner party attended by a number of distinguished writers and myself as the only woman, attention turned to how the guests could enhance my knowledge of gay institutions, for example, gay baths. My friend, Christopher Isherwood, then began a very dramatic story about how he would take me to the Crystal Baths on the Santa Monica beach, and what we would see, beginning on Level 1 – nude men in various sexual activities – complete with hilarious descriptions of the activities on each of the various levels until we reached the top. And then, he said, I would be killed, because no woman is allowed to know the secrets of the gay world and live.
The issue of confidentiality became acute in what I shall refer to later as "the Year of the Trial." Meanwhile, my adversarial position vis-a-vis the Los Angeles police force needs some clarification. I was pressured by a psychiatrist friend to seek an appointment with the chief of police. My friend said, "Of course he knows about your research activities and it would be helpful if he met you in person." How would the chief of police know about my research activities? In an invited paper entitled "The Gay Community," given in Copenhagen in 1961, I have described my research activities in gay bars. The police would have been aware of these activities, in part because I was usually the only woman in a bar. I hasten to add that I always went to a gay bar with a gay friend.
I was advised by my psychiatrist friend not to go alone for the appointment with the chief. Why? Because I was a woman. Dr. Worden accompanied me, biting his nails and saying that he had watched too many police films. Chief Parker did not understand why I was doing the research, "because a man from Pasadena proved it was all glandular." When I objected, he said "Well, it's like the smog. It doesn't matter how it got here. We just have to deal with it." He then wanted to introduce me to the Central Vice detail. I avoided that because I knew that if I did, the news would be all over the gay community within hours. I asked whether the police would ever try to subpoena my confidential files. "No," he replied, "If you should ever have information about a homosexual murder, I hope you would voluntarily give us the information."
I turn now to the Year of the Trial, 1961. Briefly, the facts are that five people were arrested and charged with conspiracy to obtain a criminal abortion. The five were two psychiatrists, an obstetrician, a young man, and myself. I had referred the young man (a friend) and his girlfriend to one psychiatrist, who had recommended a therapeutic abortion and who had sent the pair to a second psychiatrist, who made the same recommendation and sent them to an obstetrician. He performed the surgery in his office without a nurse present and sent the woman home. Complications developed. Her boyfriend insisted on hospitalization. Her father moved her to another hospital and declared charges to the police.
When two men, identifying themselves as with the state board of quality assurance visited me in my university office, I became alarmed when they asked "On what do you do research?" and "Do you accept fees for referrals?" It did not occur to me that I was personally in danger. However, waves of anxiety swept over me as I thought about the perils to my research data riddled with identifying names, places, and dates. I knew, as did many, of the unscrupulous surveillance practices of the Los Angeles Police Department at that time. My secretary and I spent the better part of the year in removing identifying data from the records. A judge, six months after the grand jury indictment, ruled that the jury had insufficient grounds to indict me. The anxiety did not diminish until both psychiatrists and the young man were declared innocent. Many of my friends believe that the police acted in my case only because of my research on homosexuality. It cannot be proved, but I believe it is so.
Incidentally, I carried a letter signed by the Chancellor at UCLA which identified me in case my activities were ever brought to the attention of law enforcement authorities. I never needed it, and felt I never would unless the university was involved.
The NIMH Task Force 	  	
In 1969, I was called by Stanley Yolles, then director of NIMH, asking me to come to Washington and "tell him what we ought to be doing about homosexuality." He added that "we want to sweep it out from beneath the rug." I suggested that we needed a group of thoughtful people who were social scientists or were in law, religion, or psychiatry and who could bring their knowledge to bear on this question. The director replied that if I would give him a list, he would make the appointments for a "blue ribbon task force." I looked forward to it with high expectations.
The agenda that I proposed was both a comprehensive outline of research and of social policy issues, including the possible endorsement of a model penal code and the establishment at NIMH of a center for the study of sexuality. Many members of the task force said at the outset that they knew nothing about homosexuality. I thought that should not exclude them because they were needed to bring social science to bear on the issues. The discussions were lively and gave promise of a good final report, with two exceptions.
The stumbling blocks were viewing homosexuality as not necessarily synonymous with psychopathology, and endorsing a model penal code in which homosexuality was no longer viewed as a crime. Thus, three task force members wrote dissenting opinions on the basis that (a) NIMH was not a policymaking, but solely a research institution, and (b) that there were not enough data to support the "normal" position. Within three years, however, the American Psychiatric Association voted to delete homosexuality from its diagnostic handbook, and the American Psychological Association (APA) followed.
Our task force report was not published for two years, an indication of what some officials thought of it. Judd Marmor, a distinguished and indispensable member of the task force, when asked why we did not accomplish more, said that one possible reason might be that I was too optimistic. That may be true. After all, in 1963, Dr. Marmor asked me to write a chapter for his first book on homosexuality, titled Inversion. He said that I must write it, "because you are the only person to hold your point of view."
Highlights and Satisfactions 	  	
I have spoken of some of the problems related to my research in the repressive milieu of the 1950s and I 960s. I would like now to mention some highlights of my satisfaction and delight.
First, can you imagine what it was like when I examined the results of the three judges of the adjustment ratings from the projective techniques? I knew the men for whom the ratings were made, and I was certain as a clinician that they were relatively free of psychopathology. But what would these superb clinicians find? You know now that the two groups, homosexuals and heterosexuals, did not differ in adjustment of psychopathology. When I saw that, I wept with joy. I knew that the psychiatrists would not accept it then. But sometime!
[cut, for the purposes of the game]
Another, earlier event was back in 1961, when I was invited to give a paper at the International Congress of Psychology. I learned that a young Norwegian, Finn Carling, was beginning a study of homosexuals and that it would be worth my while to see him. When I called him, he said that he was just beginning and that it would not be worth my while. I persisted, and he agreed to meet me at the airport. "You will know me because I have a big dog," he said. And so he did. Friends told me he was a spastic. Don't ask me how he drove his car, because he had the use of two forefingers only. He said, "If you don't mind not talking about science for awhile, I will show you where I grew up." He pointed to a stream running through a meadow where his parents had put him, having been told he would never walk. But he did – at 15.
After we had tea, he turned to me and said, "I want you to know that I am on their side." I think I said, "Me too." And then he said an astonishing thing: "I am not only studying homosexuals, but I am studying refugees, because they teach me the meaning of movement. I am studying the blind, because they will teach me the meaning of sight, of vision. I am studying homosexuals, because they will teach me the meaning of love.
That was 30 years ago, but Finn Carling's radiant face, his enormous physical and psychological courage, and what he wanted to learn from gay and lesbian folk have never faded in intensity. In an age when the scourge of AIDS continues relentlessly, there are many images of love in the gay world. I have the conviction that without love, the gay world would perish.
In the summer of 1937, at the height of the Spanish Civil War, I was in London. I attended a Spanish Republican rally. It was at fever pitch, so to speak, and the crowd was demanding that Paul Robeson, that great man and great voice, sing the Spanish National Anthem. From time to time, he would say "I'm saving the best to the last." Finally, with sounds that seemed to come from the bowels of the earth, he sang the Spanish National Anthem.
I have one more event to note, and I have saved the most extraordinary to the Last. About four years ago, I received a letter from a trustee officer at a bank in Lincoln, Nebraska. In it he stated that Wayne Placek had designated me to select a committee to decide how the trust fund he was establishing should distribute funds for the purpose of research to increase "the general public's understanding of gay men and lesbians, and reduce the stress experienced by those people in this and future civilizations." I remember that I had interviewed Wayne Placek in the late 1950s, but nothing unusual came to mind. I did remember that, along with many others, he hated being gay because of society's treatment.
After a period of three years, the final settlement of the fund was announced – approximately a half million dollars! Through the valiant and imaginative work of Steve Morin and Douglas Kimmel, the money now is in the American Psychological Foundation, earmarked for research under the control of Dr. Morin and selected officers of Division 44, and the guidance of the Foundation.

### Game Objectives
You were trained as a behaviorist, by Karl Muenzinger and Robert Yerkes, who was a good friend of John Watson. Many of Watson's arguments draw from comparative psychology as a discipline. Muensinger's view, however, was more like Tolman's than Yerkes (see the “History of Definitions of 'Psychology'” in the gamebook). You are committed—as is your field—to the thesis that one can learn about the psychology of humans by studying the minds of animals. If the cognitivists are successful at getting the line between “man and brutes” reestablished, it may relegate your field to a psychological footnote.  Defend behaviorism, in particular the thesis that there is no hard and fast line between humans and animals, from the attacks of the cognitivitsts.

You published a pivotal study on homosexuality in 1956 and 1957 that along with Kinsey's report, is usually credited with starting the movement to remove homosexuality from the DSM.  Look up the study and read it carefully. You'll be expected to speak about its findings during the 1971 conference.  You should also understand your opponent's position on this matter.
Freud mentions homosexuality a number of places in Introductory Lectures on Psychoanalysis, and it is crucially important that you study these carefully.  Freud believes that sexual life of children, which is regarded at the time as 'normal' includes a number of activities that would later in life be viewed as 'perverse', including same-sex contact.  In Freud's theory, heterosexuality develops with puberty in normal people. In 'inverts' or homosexuals, something goes wrong in this development. The object of ones' 'natural' desire--the genitals of the opposite sex—becomes transformed into parts of the body that represent those parts in the same sex.  Thus, homosexuality is no different in psychological mechanism than a foot fetish or any other neurotic 'perversion' (see p. 376-384 of Introductory Lectures) Homosexuality is not a psychologically isolated condition. According to Freud:
“We are compelled, however, to regard the choice of an object of one's own sex as a divergence in erotic life which is of positively habitual occurrence, and we are learning more and more to ascribe an especially high importance to it.” (p. 381)
In short, homosexuality is a kind of neurosis, yet it is not, itself, particularly worrying. The action itself is merely 'habitual,' and hence can be cured through standard habit-blocking therapy (Freud suggests that paranoia stops homosexuality on p. 381 of the Introductory Lectures).  It is, however, invariably an indicator of deeper psychological problems, as the transference and substitution of the 'natural' object of sexual desire to a different object will cause neurosis. See Ch 26 of the Introductory Lectures, especially p. 530, for Freud's explanation of homosexuality as neurotic narcissism.
Your study, which sought to establish if homosexuals exhibited neurotic symptoms aside from their homosexuality, is a direct challenge to Freud's theory.  The current advocates of the Freudian tradition in Homosexuality are C. Socarides and I. Bieber.  Bieber's 1962 book Homosexuality presented the result of his 9-year study of 100 homosexual males. According to him, homosexuals males are those whose 'heterosexual instinct' is crippled in some way. Be ready to defend your study against criticisms from Socarides and Bieber.
When, and if, the game reaches a point of trying to define mental illness, you must pass a behaviorist interpretation of mental disorder / illness.
#### Specific Assignments
You are an initial member of the program committee, with your term expiring in 1972. That means it is your responsibility to coordinate with the other two members (Gebhard and Anastasi) to arrange the conference schedule for the second week of class. After that, consider running for the Board of Directors or President of the APA. 71: Washington DC, 72: Dallas.
In 1971, you are scheduled to give a talk entitled “The mental health of non-patient male homosexuals” during the panel session titled “ Psychiatry: Friend or Foe to Homosexuals: A Dialogue” with John Fryer. This talk should introduce the history of your research, and the data you have that shows that non-patient homosexuals are not mentally disordered. You might also make reference to the 1964 ‘Midtown Manhatten Study’ (1964), which seems to show that mental health disturbances are more related to social-economic status than any other factor—in this case, it may be consistent with your findings that any perceived mental illness is gay men is the result of their ostracism from society, rather than the cause thereof. 
In 1972, there will probably be competing papers from Socrides &amp; Bieber and Richard Green. Both of these papers will likely contain critiques or analyzes of your data. Be prepared to defend your study, or use it to critique others.
In 1973, oppose the dissolution of the nomenclature committee on grounds that the proposed taskforce would give too much power to a single individual: Spitzer.  The process of classifying mental illness needs to be open and transparent, and an elected committee would be more open and transparent than a taskforce.

            <Text>### Major Events
#### Declassification
The declassification of homosexuality is assured.  The only characters who argue against it are Bieber and Socarides.  The NY Times obituary of Socarides quotes Gilbert Herdt of National Sexuality Resource Center in San Francisco as saying “Socarides outlived his time.” That is roughly correct. While it may not have occurred to many psychiatrists in 1971 that the classification of homosexuality was a problem for the homosexual community, once it was pointed out, the opinion swung: 58% of the population approved in 1973, and there is great embarrassment about that era today. 
As such, the main debate here is about the procedure by which homosexuality will be removed. Green and Marmor will be tempted to just ram it through the board of directors without consulting the population.  That should be avoided.  I've set up the game so that Marmor's original proposal should be remanded to the nomenclature committee, which will report in 1972, requiring a final vote of the membership in 1973.  While the result is not in doubt, without that process, Socarides' rhetoric that the decision was political, not scientific, will be bolstered.
#### DSM-III
The issue in the DSM-III is not the actual categories, but whether the categories should be based on the etiology or the observable symptoms.  At the same time, the Spitzer taskforce should propose a covering definition of 'mental illness' that will directly challenge the views of Szasz and Albee.  It should fail (it did, in reality). 

#### Fission
Members of the factions have the option to form splinter associations: the behaviorists found the “Society for the Experimental Analysis of Behavior” (actual founding 1957), and found two journals: Journal of the Experimental Analysis of Behavior and Journal of Applied Behavioral Analysis. Psychoanalysts form the American Psychoanalytic Association (actual founding in 1911, but grew rapidly in this era) and the journal Journal of the American Psychoanalytic Association (JAPA), and the Cognitivists form the Cognitive Science Society (1979) and its associated journals. 
No students are given direct instruction on whether the fission requires withdrawal from the APA. Some, esp. those playing Beiber and Socarides, may feel stronger about the fission than the cognitivists Miller and Chomsky.  This is historically appropriate–by the mid-1980s, cognitivism generally dominated the APA.  Contemporary behaviorism has adapted to resemble cognitivism in many ways, by include talk of 'motivations' and of the 'function of behavior' in their explanations.

#### Adjustment of Homosexual and Heterosexual Women

Background The traditional psychiatric belief that homosexual men are emotionally unstable has recently been challenged by Evelyn Hooker's study of non-prisoner non-patient homosexual men.  There have been a few similar studies on women.  The contention that homosexual women are neurotic has typically been voiced by clinicians reporting on their own patients. One exception is the recent psychometric investigation by Kenyon (1968) who studied a non-clinical group of English homosexual women, and concluded that they were higher in neuroticism than a comparison group of heterosexuals. In contrast to the 'illness' notion of homosexuality, the authors of three psychometric studies dealing with non-clinical homosexuals and heterosexuals reported that heterosexual women were not better adjusted than homosexuals. (Armon, 1960; Freedman, 1968;

##### Rationale

The paucity of research in this area is exemplified by the fact that a total of only four studies, noted above, have been found to date. Even the clinical literature, which is replete with case studies and therapeutic discussions concerning male homosexuality, is strikingly sparse in the area of lesbianism. The present study is proposed to add to the small body of data we now have on the adjustment of homosexual versus heterosexual women.

##### Experimental Design

Working with the leadership of the New York branch of the Daughters of Bilitis, a questionnaire will be sent out to recruit members for the study. And additional questionnaire will be distributed through a popular homophile bookstore in Greenwich Village, New York. And equivalent number of heterosexual women will be recruited from the undergraduate and graduate population of local colleges and universities.

Several different instruments will be used to measure the overal psychological adjustment of the participants, including Scheier and Cattal's Neuroticism Scale Questionnaire (NSQ) (1961) tests of Alienation and Trust (Struening &amp; Richardson, 1965), Goal Directedness, Self-Acceptance and Sense of Self (Dignan, 1965), Dependency (Comry, 1964), Nurturance (Harvey et al. 1966) and Neuroticism (MacGuire 1966). The Crowne and Marlow Social Desirability Scale (1960) will also be used.  The differences on these measures between the homosexual and heterosexual women will be compared to test the 'illness' model of homosexuality in women.

##### Significance and Contribution

Recent interest in and discussions of the 'illness' model of male homosexuality have almost completely ignored the parallel issues for homosexual women. This study is a small step towards closing that gap.

AN EXAMINATION OF WILHELM REICH’S DEMONSTRATIONS OF ORGONE ENERGY
Author:
Robert L. Spitzer, M.D. - Cornell University (April 1953)
Purpose
Wilhelm Reich’s early work in psychoanalysis gradually led him into a field which he now calls biophysics. The concept of a new kind of energy, which he calls “orgone energy,” is basic to his present work. Reich defines orgone energy as “Primordial cosmic energy; universally present and demonstrable visually, thermically, electroscopically, and by means of Geiger-Müller counters. In the living organism: biological energy. Discovered by Reich between 1936 and 1940.” [1]
In his many writings of the past decade, Reich has by means of the concept of orgone energy presented explanations of such varied phenomena as the origin of life, the origin of the galaxies, the aetiology of cancer and neuroses, the belief of people in God, and many other phenomena. To one who has carefully read Reich’s work, it becomes clear that if orgone energy does exist and has the properties ascribed to it by Reich, then clearly, an understanding of orgone energy is a most valuable piece of information, useful in explaining many riddles of nature.
The purpose of this paper is to present a critical examination of the demonstrations of orgone energy offered by Reich in his book, The Cancer Biopathy. [2] The examination offered in this paper consists of the duplication by the writer of eight crucial experiments offered by Reich as proof of the existence of orgone energy along with control experiments devised by the writer to better ascertain the validity of the conclusions that Reich draws from his data.
Selection of Experiments
It was not possible, nor necessary, to duplicate all of the experiments described by Reich. “Bion” experiments involving the use of an extremely high-powered microscope and experiments using a Geiger-Müller counter were not done, because it was impossible to secure the necessary instruments. A study of the therapeutic effect of the Orgone Accumulator upon the human organism could not be attempted, because to do justice to the problem, it would be necessary to have at least eight subjects devote a half an hour a day for a period of at least a month, and such subjects were not available. However, of the eight experiments duplicated, three in particular form the pillars upon which the verification of the concept of orgone energy rests: namely, the visual, thermal, and electroscopic demonstrations.
Scope of Paper
It is, of course, obvious but perhaps necessary to state that this paper deals only with that

part of Reich’s work which deals specifically with the concept of orgone energy. It is in no way meant as an evaluation of any other part of Reich’s work or of his psychological and psychoanalytical theories.
The work outlined in these pages was not done hastily but in all, took eight months to complete. It was all conducted from September 1952 to April 1953 at Ithaca, New York. All of the experiments are fairly simple and can easily be reproduced by anyone interested. The experiments were approached objectively and the conclusions drawn were dictated solely by the data collected.
I. Visual Demonstration of Orgone Energy
A. Flickering in the Sky
[3] Problem
According to Reich, orgone energy can be observed visibly in the sky by looking “as if in the far distance.” The energy is perceived as a wave-like, rhythmical flickering, with rapidly appearing and disappearing dots and lines of light. Because the phenomenon changes with various weather conditions and ceases if the eyes are closed, Reich concludes that the phenomenon is present throughout the atmosphere and visible “in the sky.”
The experiments performed here attempted to control the focal distance between the retina of the eye and the outside world to determine whether the phenomenon is in the sky or atmosphere of the earth or solely in the eye of the observer.
Procedure
Eight naive subjects were used. Each subject was placed in front of a window through which the sky could be viewed. Each was instructed to look as if in the far distance and report when he observed the flickering phenomenon. The subject was then seated in front of a ground-glass screen that was illuminated by an electric light bulb attached to a rheostat to vary the intensity of the light. With his eyes a fraction of an inch away from the illuminated screen with the bulb at its most intense illumination, the subject was asked to report what he saw. The intensity of the bulb was then varied, and the subject was asked to report any changes in what he saw.
Results
All eight subjects quickly perceived the flickering phenomenon in the sky described by Reich. All eight subjects, when seated in front of the bright, ground-glass screen reported that they saw the same phenomenon as in the sky only that it appeared more intense in front of the glass screen. All eight subjects reported that the phenomenon became less intense and finally disappeared as the intensity of the bulb was lowered.
Conclusions
If the phenomenon were in the sky, then the phenomenon should either disappear completely or be much less intense when the eyes are directly in front of a translucent screen. However, the results prove, with a confidence limit of 95%, that the phenomenon of flickering in the sky has nothing whatever to do with an energy in the sky but exists solely in the eye and becomes visible upon adequate illumination of the eye. Reich’s claim that the phenomenon is less intense on hazy days due to the absorption of orgone energy by the
     
humidity appears to be without foundation, as the critical factor seems to be the intensity of the field as shown by the fact that all of the subjects reported that the phenomenon disappeared when the light was turned down.
As to just what occurs in the eye which creates this phenomenon, whether it be blood corpuscles moving on the retina or the random discharge of rods or cones, is not of direct concern here but requires further study.
B. Perception of Orgone Energy in an Orgone Room
[4] Problem
Reich reports that in a light-tight, dark room, only black is perceived, while in an “orgone room” constructed by lining a regular room with sheet metal, the higher concentration of orgone energy is visible in the following manner: “In the course of about half an hour the complete darkness gives way to a vague blue-gray shimmer. It is as if vapors of gray blue color were slowly moving through the room.” [5] The first part of the experiment is devised to see whether the light phenomenon in an orgone room, as described by Reich, differs from that observed in a regular room. Reich maintains that the light phenomena were objective and were magnified with simple magnifying glasses. An attempt was made to determine whether the light phenomena were objective or existed solely in the eye of the observer. Reich reports that in an orgone room, the eyes become irritated, and hence an attempt was made to determine whether such irritation is reported in a regular dark room.
Procedure
Eight naïve subjects were used in two groups of four. Each group on two separate occasions sat in a light-tight, dark room and were instructed to write as best they could on a blank, white card everything that they saw and to make careful note of the possible form, color, and movement, if any, of what they saw. If they saw anything, they were to put their hands in front of their eyes and to report whether the phenomenon changed. They were instructed not to talk while in the darkroom about what they saw. As each group left the darkroom, the members were instructed to record whether their eyes felt irritated.
Results
All but one of the subjects wrote that they saw various colors other than black. Only one subject reported that all he saw was black, although he qualified it by describing it as “black of different intensities” to indicate a fog-like formation.
All of the subjects, except the one who saw only black, reported movement of various kinds. Some saw fog-like movement: dots, streaks, etc. The same seven subjects later reported that their eyes felt irritated.
All of the subjects reported that the phenomenon did not change in the least way when they put their hands in front of their eyes.
Conclusions
Reich’s claim that in a dark room “We see nothing but black, that is, nothing. . . . In an absolute darkroom there is absolute darkness” [6] appears to be completely erroneous. Immediately or upon adaptation of the eyes, the dark room does not appear black but
 
generally grayish, and various colors are perceived as demonstrated by this experiment, with a confidence limit of 95%. Hence, the light phenomenon which Reich describes as being peculiar to the orgone room appears to be no different from that observed in a regular dark room.
As the light phenomenon was not affected by the placing of the hands over the eyes, the phenomenon must be subjective and therefore cannot be magnified.
As seven of the subjects all reported that their eyes were irritated in an ordinary dark room; there is no grounds for believing that any energy peculiar to an orgone room is responsible.
Thus, the light phenomenon in an orgone room appears to be the same as that observed in a regular dark room and is a subjective phenomenon. The exact nature and cause of the phenomenon, like the cause of the flickering in the sky, is not of direct concern here but requires further study. The irritations reported by the subjects is most likely due to the straining effect of keeping one’s eyes open in the dark for a long period of time without focusing the eyes on any subject.
II. Electrostatic Demonstration of Orgone Energy
A. Electroscopic Demonstration of Two Basic Principles of Orgone Energy
[7]
Problem
Reich contends that what is known as “static electricity” is in reality orgone energy. He believes that orgone energy has two basic governing principles: 1) orgone energy and organic material attract each other, and 2) orgone energy and metal first attract each other and then immediately repel each other. As will be seen in the problem dealing with the thermal demonstration of orgone energy in an Orgone Accumulator, these principles are basic to the theory behind the construction of Reich’s Orgone Accumulator.
The purpose of this experiment was to duplicate Reich’s demonstration of the above two principles. He describes his experiment and the conclusions that he draws from them as follows:
A metal sphere is set on a rubber or cork plate. On one side of the equator of the sphere, at a distance of about 2–3 mm., we suspend a small piece of cork, on the other side, at the same distance, a small piece of tinfoil. The metal sphere is connected by a wire with an electroscope.
We then charge a polystyrene rod by stroking it once or twice, without rubbing, over our hair. The rod is then brought near the metal point of the electroscope which is connected with the sphere. . . . The cork will move toward the metal sphere and will adhere to it for a shorter or longer period of time. This means: the orgone energy in the rod has led to the formation of an orgone energy field around the metal sphere, in which organic material is attracted and held fast.
At the other side of the sphere we notice what happens with the tinfoil when we approach the charged rod to the electroscope. We observe that the effect on the tinfoil is different [emphasis mine—R.S.] from that on the cork. The
 
tinfoil is first attracted toward the metal sphere but immediately repelled and held at a distance. That is, two metallic substances in the orgone energy field repel each other. From this it follows also that metal attracts orgone but instead of absorbing it, as organic material does, it repels it. [8]
Procedure
The experimental design as described by Reich, as above, was duplicated, and data on various days was collected.
Results
Whenever the electroscope was charged, the cork and tinfoil were attracted toward the metal sphere. As soon as the cork and tinfoil touched the sphere, both the cork and tinfoil were immediately repelled and held at a distance. The cork and tinfoil then both gradually came closer to the metal shape and again, as soon as they touched the sphere, both were repelled and held at a distance. This process continued for some time, until the charge originally put on the electroscope was discharged.
Conclusions
The data obtained directly contradicts Reich’s data. In the above experiment, there seemed to be no marked difference between the behavior of the cork and the tinfoil, thus yielding no evidence that orgone energy or static electricity attracts organic material and attracts and then repels metallic material.
The classical theory of static electricity easily explains the behavior of the cork and tinfoil. A charged rod contains an excess of electrons, which creates a negative charge on the rod. This negative charge attracts all neutral objects to it. As soon as the smaller object touches the negative sphere, some of the excess electrons flow into the neutral object, giving it a negative charge, because it then has an excess of electrons. The object and the charged sphere are now both negative and hence repel each other. Gradually, the electric charge on the object leaks off, and the object is once more neutral and is attracted to the sphere. This process continues until the charge on the sphere has been sufficiently dissipated.
B. Electroscopic Discharge in the Orgone Accumulator and the Atmosphere
[9]
Problem
As was seen in the previous experiment, Reich believes that what is called “static electricity” and orgone energy are one and the same thing. He claims that the proof of this lies in the fact that the discharge of an electroscope is slower inside of an orgone accumulator than in the atmosphere due to the higher concentration of orgone energy in the accumulator. He reasons as follows:
The energy with which the electroscope was charged will be discharged into the air the more rapidly the lower the energy tension is in the air relative to the charge of the electroscope. Conversely, the energy will be discharged the more slowly the higher the tension is in the surrounding air, that is, the smaller the difference between the energy charge of the electroscope and that of the surrounding air. [10]
 
 The purpose of this experiment was to duplicate Reich’s demonstration of the relative discharges of an electroscope in an orgone accumulator and in the air.
Procedure
Reich does not say whether he used one electroscope first in the air and then in the accumulator, or vice versa, or whether he used two electroscopes at the same time, one in the air and the other in the accumulator. As will be shown later, these and other methodological procedures turn out to be exceedingly important. His general procedure, which was followed accurately, is to charge an electroscope up to the tenth scale division of the particular electroscope he used and then to measure how long it takes for the leaf to fall until it reads the eighth scale division. This time value is obtained from discharging the electroscope both in the air and in the accumulator. The procedure is repeated on various occasions during all kinds of weather.
The glass back of the electroscope used was replaced with a piece of cardboard that had two large holes in it, so that the air in the electroscope could communicate with the outer air as Reich suggests.
In the beginning of the experiment, the following procedure was adopted: the electroscope was charged in the air up to the ninth division on a cardboard scale. The length of time that it took until it discharged to the seventh division was noted. The electroscope was then charged up to the ninth scale division and placed in the orgone accumulator described in a following experiment, and the length of time required for a similar discharge to the seventh scale division was recorded. The procedure was repeated many times a day on different days during varied weather conditions.
The data obtained from this procedure described above for four days are as follows:
Discharge Time in from Room
9-7 (1) 6 minutes 9-7 (1) 4 minutes 9-7 (1) 9 minutes 9-7 (1) 9 minutes 9-7 (1) 3 minutes 9-7 (1) 3 minutes 9-7 (1) 2 minutes
Time in Orgone Accumulator
(2) 15 minutes (2) 10 minutes (2) 21 minutes (2) 21 minutes (2) 8 minutes (2) 9 minutes (2) 8 minutes
This data would indicate that the discharge is slower in an accumulator than in the air, as Reich supports. However, after doing the last run, it suddenly occurred to the writer that perhaps the fact that in every run, the electroscope was first discharged in the air and then discharged in the accumulator might have had some effect on the results. The electroscope was then taken out of the accumulator and recharged immediately in the air and left to discharge. The same discharge which had taken 8 minutes in the accumulator now took 12 minutes in the air! The electroscope was again immediately recharged in the air and the
discharge then took 14 minutes.
 Thus, it became evident that the order of presentation seemed to be at least in part responsible for the slower discharges in the accumulator. Continued experimentation revealed the following facts: if the electroscope is repeatedly charged in the air, the time required for the electroscope to discharge a given unit increases until it reaches a maximum limit which remains fairly constant, as long as the electroscope is immediately charged after being discharged. If the electroscope is not charged for a few hours, the same process is repeated until a maximum limit is again reached.
It became obvious that in order to determine whether the discharge in the accumulator was slower than in the air, it was first necessary to bring the discharge time up to its limit by repeated chargings and dischargings, and when the time was a constant for discharge, then measure the discharge in an accumulator.
Results
Using the above mentioned procedure, the following results were obtained:

Conclusions
It was found that when an electroscope is discharged in the air and then in an orgone accumulator, the discharge in the accumulator is slower. However, it was also found that this effect was at least in part due to the order of presentation, as the time it takes for an electroscope to discharge a given unit increases up to a maximum limit. When the maximum limit was reached in the air and the electroscope was then discharged in an accumulator, it was found that the discharge was not slower in the accumulator but that within the accuracy of the instrument, the data revealed no significant difference in time values.
As Reich makes no mention of the increase in discharge time that was discovered in this experiment, it is possible that his results are due to the mistake of discharging the electroscope first in the air and then in the accumulator before the electroscope has reached its maximum discharge value. It may be that the effect discovered here does not occur with all electroscopes, although the same effort was found to be present with two other electroscopes built differently than the one used here.
(9) 13 minutes
(5) 13 minutes (7) 13 minutes
 The data thus gives no suggestion that any kind of an energy is being concentrated in the orgone accumulator such that it slows the discharge of an electroscope.
III. Thermal Demonstration of Orgone Energy
[11] Problem
Believing that 1) organic substances absorb orgone energy, 2) metallic substances reflect orgone energy, and 3) stoppage of the kinetic energy of the orgone energy results in a temperature rise, Reich has devised an apparatus, namely the Orgone Accumulator, already mentioned, with the electroscopic demonstration of orgone energy, which supposedly accumulates the energy.
The Orgone Accumulator can be made large enough for an individual to sit in, as in the orgone-therapy treatment of cancer patients, or smaller for experimental purposes. The design is simple and is basically a box of any size that is lined with a metallic material such as galvanized sheet iron or metal screen and has an outside layer of a nonconducting substance (what Reich calls “organic”) such as cotton or fiberglass. The accumulator may consist of merely one layer of metallic and nonconducting substances or of many layers. An increase in the number of layers supposedly results in an increase in the orgonotic potential of the atmosphere to the inside of the accumulator and hence a higher concentration of orgone energy. Accumulators used in therapy vary from three to twenty layers.
The purpose of this experiment is to duplicate Reich’s demonstration of the thermal effect of the accumulation of orgone energy. He writes:
The energy particles within the box are thrown from metal wall to metal wall. They are being stopped on all sides. Since heat ascends, any possible temperature rise will be most readily registered above the top metal sheet. There must be a temperature difference between the enclosed air in the cylinder above the accumulator on the one hand and the rest of the room on the other. . . . If our assumptions are correct, the temperature difference must be positive and always present. . . . Measurements taken several times a day over a period of weeks reveal an arithmetic mean of about 0.5degreesC. [12]
Procedure
Following Reich’s description of an experimental Orgone Accumulator used in the thermal demonstration of the energy, a box was built measuring one foot square on the inside, lined with galvanized sheet metal and having five layers of steel wool and fiberglass. The walls were about five inches thick on each side. A metal cylinder about six inches long was connected to the top of the sheet-metal lining. A thermometer, accurate to one tenth of a degree centigrade, was inserted through the top of the cylinder and rested a fraction of an inch above the top piece of the sheet metal of the accumulator.
A control box constructed solely out of organic material was built, and a similar thermometer that had been calibrated with the first thermometer was inserted inside the box. The two boxes were placed at opposite ends of a room. The temperature readings for both boxes were taken regularly several times a day for a period of about three weeks and then every few days for a period of about three months. The two boxes were then placed on a porch that had no heating that was separated from the outside by a screen door. The readings were taken every week for about a month and a half.
 Results
The first readings varied from day to day but all followed a similar pattern. As the room warmed up in the morning from the cold night, the temperature of the accumulator (To) was always slightly lower than the temperature of the control (Tc). In the late afternoon, as the room began to cool, the temperature of the accumulator was slightly higher than the temperature of the control. Thus:
Morning Afternoon (To–Tc)=0 to –2degreesC (To–Tc)=0 to plus 2degreesC
The temperature was negative in the morning and gradually became positive by the afternoon. The maximum difference reached was about 2degreesC.
As at least part of (To–Tc) was due to the fact that the accumulator was a better insulator than the control box and thus lagged behind the warming room in the morning and cooling room in the afternoon, the temperature differences could not show if in addition to the lagging behind of the accumulator a slight amount of heat nevertheless was created in the accumulator.
In order to equalize the insulating properties of both the accumulator and the control, the control box was stuffed with cotton, which further insulated it from the room temperature. In order to vary the insulating effect of the control, the thermometer was fitted loosely so it could either be inserted deeper into the cotton, to increase the insulating effect, or withdrawn, to diminish the insulating effect. The two thermometers now always read exactly the same, at all times of the day, during all kinds of weather, in the room or on the cold porch, where the temperature went to as low as 6degreesC.
Thus, when the insulating effect of the accumulator and the control were equalized:
In All Kinds of Weather and All Times of the Day (To–Tc)=0.0degreesC
Conclusions
According to Reich, Orgone Accumulators work everywhere, yet after constructing a control box to equalize the insulating effect of the Orgone Accumulator, no temperature difference was recorded. The data give no indication that any kind of kinetic energy is being transformed into heat. There appears to be no foundation to the belief that an orgone- energy accumulator concentrates an energy which raises the temperature of the accumulator.
In October 1952, a letter was sent to Reich describing the results of this experiment. He wrote back saying that “severe atmospheric disturbances of the last two years” have seriously upset the temperature differences. If one then assumes that due to atmospheric conditions occurring in 1951 and 1952, orgone energy no longer breaks down into heat, then it is a wonder that such a drastic change in the functioning of orgone energy should not have had equally disastrous effects upon the human organism, as orgone energy is supposed to be the basic energy of life. One would expect mass plagues and outbreaks of disease, cancer, and other maladies during those years, yet the health of humanity during those years did not reveal any observable drastic change.
 It might be mentioned that if such a temperature could be obtained, it would be relatively easy for an engineer to utilize it as a source of power. Such a power would be inexpensive, constant, easy to handle, and more than plentiful. It could transform barren wastes into thriving communities and provide the whole world with a source of energy that would revolutionize modern industry. Yet no such attempt to harness the reported temperature difference seems to have been made by either Reich or his coworkers. To my knowledge, no discussion of the possibilities discussed above have even appeared in the literature dealing with orgone energy. (See bibliography.)
IV. Orgonotic Attraction in the Energy Field of the Orgone Accumulator
[13]
Problem
Reich maintains that the energy field of an orgone accumulator has a specific effect upon a magnetic compass. He writes:
We bring a good magnetic needle close to an orgone accumulator of 1 cubic foot, in the following manner: 1) close to the center of the 4 upper edges, b) close to the center of the lower edges. Result: The magnetic north pole regularly turns toward the center of the upper edges, the magnetic south pole toward the center of the lower edges. Whichever edges we made the upper, lower or side edges, the magnetic needle always reacts as described. Conclusion: The reaction of the energy field of an orgone accumulator is of an orgonotic and not of a magnetic nature. [14]
The purpose of this experiment was to duplicate Reich’s experiment and if similar results were found, to devise a control which would test whether it is the specific structure of a Orgone Accumulator that is yielding the results and not merely the metal in the accumulator.
Procedure
A good magnetic compass was brought to the center of the top edges and then the center of the bottom edges of a one-cubic-foot accumulator, as was described in previous experiments. The accumulator was then turned upside down, and the compass was again brought to the center of the top and bottom edges. The compass was then brought to the top of a piece of sheet metal, one foot square, and then to the bottom. The piece of sheet metal was turned upside down and the procedure repeated.
Results
As Reich indicated, the magnetic north pole always turns to the top of the accumulator and the magnetic south pole to the bottom of the accumulator, regardless of which edges we make the top, bottom, or side. However, identical results are obtained using an ordinary piece of sheet metal. The top of the metal always attracts the magnetic north pole and the bottom the magnetic south pole of the compass.
Conclusions
In neglecting to run a control experiment, Reich makes the assumption that the described effect is due to the orgone accumulator and not merely the metal in the orgone accumulator.
He fails to realize that it is a well-known fact that metal, if left standing (such as the hulls of ships or the metallic structures of sky scrapers), eventually becomes magnetized, just as a piece of metal left in contact with a permanent magnet soon becomes magnetized. If the metal is then reversed, it becomes remagnetized. Reich is correct when he says: “The poles of magnetic attraction (south and north) are not interchangeable, except if one remagnetizes a weaker magnet with a stronger one.” [15] He fails to see that this statement also applies to the earth, which is the stronger magnet, and the sheet metal in the orgone accumulator, which acts as the weaker magnet.
One well-versed in Reich’s theory of orgone energy might argue that the piece of sheet metal used as a control in the above experiment is in fact a one-layer orgone accumulator. It is difficult to see how a straight piece of metal, which supposedly reflects orgone energy on both sides, can accumulate orgone energy. But even if this were the case, then surely Reich’s demonstration does not prove his contention that “The attraction effect of the orgone accumulator, then, is not due to definite parts of the material, and can, therefore, not be of a magnetic nature.” [16] This statement would only be true if a piece of sheet metal by itself did not give the described reaction.
V. The Organization of Matter from Free Orgone Energy
[17]
A. Freezing of Bion Water
[18]
In what Reich calls “Experiment XX,” he believes he has shown that under special conditions, orgone energy organizes itself into matter. He believes that when earth is made to “swell” by boiling or autoclavation, orgone energy is released from the disintegrating dirt, forming what he calls “bion water.” Bion water is yellow, supposedly indicating a high concentration of free orgone energy. When this water is made to freeze, the yellow color contracts into a spot in the center. When thawed, flakes of matter appear. From this, Reich concludes:
The appearance of a concentrated yellow spot in the center of the clear ice admits of only one plausible explanation: The free orgone energy in the freezing water acts exactly like the orgone energy in a freezing organism; contracting, it retracts from where the freezing takes place. [19]
The first part of the experiment attempted to duplicate this demonstration and then to perform a control experiment to determine whether in the freezing of any colored solution the color contracts toward the center, when the solution is composed of a colorless solvent and a colored solution.
Procedure
Bion water was made according to the directions given by Reich:
Ordinary garden soil is put through a screen and thus cleaned of stones, clumps, etc. The sifted garden soil is boiled for an hour in distilled or ordinary water (the procedure followed here—R.S.) or autoclaved for half an hour (at 120degreesC and 15 lb. pressure). The water is filtrated from the boiled soil. This clear fluid we call bion water. [20]
The fluid was then frozen and observed.
 
In the control experiment, potassium permanganate (KMn04) was dissolved in a beaker of water until a purple solution was obtained. This was then frozen, and the behavior of the color observed.
Results
The filtrate of the boiled earth, which Reich calls bion water, appeared yellow. When frozen, the yellow color contracted toward the center of the solution. Exactly the same phenomenon was observed in the freezing of a purple solution of potassium permanganate: the purple color contracted toward the center, forming a deep-purple spot in the clear ice. The thawed bion water revealed flakes.
Conclusion
The bion water was found to be yellow and the yellow color contracted toward the center when the solution was frozen, exactly as described by Reich. However, because the purple color of a solution of a dissolved, colored salt yields the same results, the contraction of the yellow color in no way proves that the yellow color is due to a high concentration of orgone energy or justifies the statement of Reich that: “The appearance of a concentrated yellow spot in the center of the clear ice admits of only one plausible explanation” (emphasis mine—R.S.).
A much more plausible explanation would involve explaining the phenomenon on a molecular and crystalline basis. As the water freezes, the molecules of water are slowed down and form the crystalline structure of ice. As this process develops from the outside of the solution, which is colder, to the inside of the solution, the particles of dissolved coloring matter are forced to the center forming an intensely colored spot.
Reich is convinced that his bion water is “completely free of particles” [21] because it has been filtered. But that is an erroneous assumption. It is common knowledge that plants obtain food from the soil in the form of dissolved minerals. One cannot filter dissolved salts or even large, dissolved, long-chain organic molecules out of a solution. Reich has never even considered the possibility that the color could be from these soluble substances in the earth, of which he makes no mention.
B. The Production of Flakes from Distilled Bion Water
[22] Problem
Reich maintains that “If one distills bion water of about 40 to 50 OP (average concentration of orgone in bion water—R.S.) one finds some flakes immediately after cooling, and numerous flakes after freezing.” [22] This is of vital importance, for if the flakes can be produced from distilled bion water, then clearly the flakes are not due to dissolved particles, as any dissolved matter would not distill over with the water vapor. The purpose of this experiment was to duplicate Reich’s experiment of distilling bion water.
Procedure
Bion water, obtained from a previously described experiment, was distilled, and the distillate carefully observed for signs of flakes. It was then frozen and thawed and again observed for evidence of flakes.
 
Results
 The distillate of the bion water was perfectly clear and showed no signs of flakes. The thawed ice was likewise clear.
Conclusion
The results indicate that the flakes are not found when the bion water is distilled and then frozen and thawed as Reich maintains. This indicates that the flakes obtained in the previous experiment were not caused by any energy being transformed into matter but rather by dissolved substances which precipitated out upon freezing.
Summary
The experiments of Reich, used by him as proof of the existence of orgone energy, fall into two categories. In the first category are those experiments that when duplicated, yield the same results as Reich reports, only by the use of a control experiment, the conclusions that Reich draws from his experiments are invalidated. In this category are the experiments on flickering in the sky, visual phenomenon in an orgone room, the slower discharge of an electroscope in an Orgone Accumulator (if Reich made the methodological error already discussed in that experiment), the orgonotic attraction of a compass in the energy field of an Orgone Accumulator, and the contraction of the yellow color in frozen bion water. In the second category are those experiments that when duplicated do not yield the results that Reich reports. In this category are the experiments on the demonstration of the two basic principles of orgone energy: the thermal demonstration of orgone energy and the production of flakes from distilled bion water.
Eight experiments whose verification are essential to the scientific demonstration of orgone energy as reported by Reich have been duplicated. Orgone energy, with the properties ascribed to it by Reich, either stands or falls on the basis of these experiments. In every case, careful examination of the data in no way proves or even hints at the existence of orgone energy.
The Therapeutic Effect of the Orgone Accumulator
The results of the work described in this paper do not prove that the use of an Orgone Accumulator for therapeutic aid is without benefit. However, whatever effect there may be, it is not due to an energy demonstrable by the means outlined by Reich. In order to prove that the effect of the Orgone Accumulator is not due merely to the fact that it is 1) an enclosed box, and hence a good insulator or 2) lined with metal, which reflects heat well, control experiments must be run. To my knowledge, neither Reich himself nor any of his coworkers have done this. No such experiment has been reported in the literature dealing with orgone energy.

ACTIV!TY
ACCURACY OF OBSERVATION Pau! J. \Moods
This activify provides an intriguing introduction to discussions of the accuracy and reliability of humans as observers of behavioral events and environmental characteristics.
A portable tape recorder, some imagination, and decent weather.
Introduce the activity to the students simply by explaining that you are going to test their powers of observation-their skill as observers. TelI them that you are going to ask a colleague of yours (or a particular member of the class) to lead the class on a 15- or 2O-minute joumey around the school grounds. Inform the students that nothing unusual has been planned, and instruct tlrem simply to observe the normal activities and circumstances in which they find themselves. They can be told that
following the walk, you will be asking them some questions about their observations.
As your colleague or class member is leading the class on the joumey aror:nd the campus, follow a strort distance behind-close enough to be able to observe the class and its environment but sufficiently removed to be able to speak quietly into a portable tape recorder without being heard by the class. As the walk proceeds, record approximately 50-60 questions on the tape, spontaneously drawn from your own observations of events and objects. (You may wish to prearrange the route to be followed and walk it through once by yourself to practice the questioning routine.) Each question you record should be followed immediately by the answer. Questions should be completely factual and objectively confirmable. Following are some examples:
"How many planes flew overhead as we reached the playing field?"
"In what activily was tfre first group of students encountered by the class engaged?"
"Where was the class when the nearby tmck backfired?"
"What color was the car that passed tlte class at the entrance to the parking lot?"
Avoid questiprns with answers that are a matter of opinion ("Was it a nice day?" "Did it se'em waim?" ).
Upon returning to the classroom, play each recorded question in turn and stop the recorder before the correct answer is played. Have students write their answers down on paper, and then play back the correct answer. On the chalkboard, keep a record of the number of right and wrong answers to each question.
The broad variation in student responses should provide gist for a discussion of (a) the reliabitity of human observations, (b) the "truth" of courtroom testimony, (c) the benefits of structuring tJre collection of

observations (perhaps by specifying beforehand what information is to be sought), and (d) the value and necessit5r of independent replication and confirmation of answers.

the professional fields to be discussed is dependent to a large extent on the pool of college graduates from which graduate and professional school stu- dents are recruited, we will present some data on trends in college enrollments and on considerations which may affect these enrollments. We will also touch on certain factors which may affect the com- petence and also the vocational choice of numbers of college students. We will then proceed to ex- amine briefly trends in the demand for scientific and professional work in the field of mental health. Finally, we will present data on manpower sup-
plies in each of the fields.
THE CRISIS IN EDUCA TION
When we look at enrollment trends in higher edu- cation in the United States, two factors stand out. First, we are wasting enormous amounts of brain power because so many of our bright young people do not receive the training for which they are in- tellectually competent. The shortage of students now finishing college, together with certain other conditions we will mention, means that our coun- try is faced for the next few years with a severe shortage of students in graduate and professional schools. Second, because of a marked rise in the birth rate beginning in the 1940's, we can expect a substantial rise in college enrollments within the
next decade. While this prospect of increasing en- rollments may appear to offer an eventual solution to the problem of shortages, we must keep in mind the increase in the country's population which will create greater demands for professional services. There is real danger that our educational system

facets of our problem in higher education.
Current shortages. A large proportion of bright young people in our society, for one reason or an- other, drop out of school before completing the twelfth grade. Of those who finish high school, many who have the ability to enter college do not enroll. Of those who do begin college, many do not graduate. Wolfle (38) tells us that of the brightest fifth of our young people only one-third finish col- lege. Even among the most able one per cent of our young people, less than two-thirds finish college. The proportion of students with lesser, but ade- quate, ability who finish college is correspondingly
lower.
The number of college graduates is dependent on
the number who are able scholastically and finan- cially to enroll, of course, but also this number is dependent on how many young people of college age there are in the population. This means that, other things being equal, the number of freshman college students is directly related to the number of babies born some eighteen years before. For the past eight years those reaching college age were born in the 1930's when there was an ebb in the na- tional birth rate. There was an artificial rise in enrollment for several years after the war, but for the past few years the number of college graduates has been falling. In all probability we have now
nearly reached the lowest point in numbers of col- lege graduates, and the curve will begin to rise, slowly for a time and then more rapidly.
What do these facts mean for graduate and pro- fessional education? For one thing, they mean that there are fewer college graduates now than at any time in the past five years, and that this small pool of college graduates will rise only slowly for the next decade. This is serious because it means

that there are, and will be, fewer students to go around to fill places in graduate and professional schools at a time when there is great social pres- sure to expand training programs.
One of the main reasons for the well-publicized shortage of engineers, teachers, scientists, and tech- nicians is to be found in this short supply of col- lege graduates. Naturally, the shortage also af- fects the recruitment of students by schools train- ing personnel in the mental health professions.
A corollary effect concerns student quality. The elementary fact is that a decrease in the pool of prospective advanced students means increased competition among professions and among profes- sional schools for the fewer college graduates, with the result that admissions standards are sometimes lowered in order to keep vacancies from developing beyond acceptable limits.
A final factor influencing the potential pool of advanced students is the present high prosperity level. We have all seen the pictures of industry representatives bidding for science and mathematics bachelors, and we have read the advertisements for science majors and technicians in our newspapers. But the job market is good for other college gradu- ates as well. Many new college graduates who, in leaner years, might go on to graduate or profes- sional school are swept off their feet by the pros-

pect of an early and painless short cut to suburbia. Prospects for the future. Educators are losing sleep over the steadily swelling enrollments in the elementary schools and are trying desperately to patch the seams of bursting schools while they re- cruit hastily retreaded teachers to fill in the second shifts (48). Although many able students drop out along the way the large increase in school en- rollments means that more students are now reach-
ing high school than ever before.
The trend over the years has been for more and
more high school graduates to enroll in college. At the beginning of the present century only one high school graduate in twenty started college. Today, roughly a third enroll in institutions of higher edu- cation. The American Council on Education (1) predicts that this trend will continue to increase and quotes the American Association of College Registrars and Admission Officers as predicting the proportion will reach SOper cent in the next dec- ade. Two years ago the American Council on Edu- cation (32) had this to say: "If added to the 70 per cent increase in number of college-age youth, we continue to admit into our colleges and universi- ties an increasing percentage of high school gradu- ates, we shall enroll in higher institutions in 1970, at least twice our present number of students."

years and for the next ten years. It will be ap-
parent from this figure that the drop in numbers of college graduates from the postwar peak is deceler- ating and that the curve will soon turn upward (with a four-year lag) to follow the rising number of high school graduates.
However optimistic this trend toward increased college enrollments appears, the fact remains that we could, if we chose, take steps to encourage large numbers of bright young people who now drop out before finishing high school to stay and graduate. This would still further increase future college en- rollments. We could, if we made a massive effort, nearly quadruple rather than double the number of college students by 1970, without any sacrifice in quality.
As the situation stands, our colleges and universi- ties, experiencing relatively lean years since the ebbing of the flood of students following the war, look with mixed feelings at the gradually rising numbers of freshmen now reaching the campuses. Looking ahead, institutions of higher education have, understandably, some satisfaction in antici- pating the oncoming tide as a source of increased income from tuition. But they see too the prob- lems to be faced in trying to educate students with, in too many cases, broad gaps in their preparation for college, especially in the areas of mathematics and the sciences (13, 49, 50). More importantly perhaps, the faculties who stand ready to face the doubled classes have been weakened by the loss of many of their number to the financial lures and fringe benefits of industry and government service
(13).
To make the massive effort required to give edu-
cational opportunities to all those who are intel- lectually qualified, would require tremendous ex- pansion and improvement of the whole educational system.

THE DEMAND FOR TRAINED PERSONNEL IN THE FIELD OF MENTAL HEALTH
There is no simple way to assess the present na- tional shortages of trained personnel in the mental health professions. A number of estimates has been made for the separate professions and we will present some of these later.
From time to time a spokesman for one of the mental health professions, or an official of a mental health movement, or a foundation concerned with large social problems, speaks out about "the prob- lem of mental illness." Usually, figures are quoted. Somehow, in this age, we have become blase or bored with figures. Yet no one has found a better way to describe the dimensions of the problem. We all know, by now, that of every ten babies born this year, one will spend some time in a mental in- stitution (24). We know that the Federal govern- ment is spending more for the care and support of psychiatric casualties among veterans than all the states combined are spending on the hospitalization of nonveterans (43), and yet we realize that the cost of our present care of people in state institu- tions, even though grossly inadequate, runs as high as one-third of the operating budget of some large and wealthy states (17). And we know that for every one of our 700,000 mental hospital inmates, there is in the community another serious case for whom there is no bed (17).
The demand for mental health personnel is not limited, of course, to those people whose disorders require separation from society. There are other vast numbers of seriously maladjusted people who need help, directly or indirectly. One in five young men of military age will enter the service with a juvenile court record; a million of our citizens are severe, chronic alcoholics, not to mention the prob- lem drinkers; one in four of our marriages will end in divorce; untold numbers suffer from incapaci- tating neuroses or emotionally aggravated physical illnesses.
Perhaps we have quoted enough figures to give some indication of the dimensions of the present problem. For the future, the prospects are even grimmer.
As our population increases, the number of first admissions to state hospitals increases. We have, it is true, stepped up somewhat the rate of dis- charges from our mental institutions over the past twenty years (Figure 2), but any ground gained

thereby is lost by the increasing rate of mental dis- order in the population (Figure 3). We chose these data on admissions and discharges to state hospitals because they were easily available. But we can be quite sure that there are similar in- creases in the neuroses, in alcoholism, and in other forms of disorder as well.
So far, we have only quoted data which indicate the numbers of people who need, or will need, pro- fessional help. But if we are to avoid an endless treadmill, it will be apparent that an even more basic need is for research personnel. At present,
less than one per cent of our total expendituresin the field of mental disorder goes into research (25). Yet research offers the only hope for eventual relief of a share of this problem. Research means highly trained people, and again we meet a demand for personnel.
Let us now look at the supply of people avail- able for work in the mental health fields.
PSYCHIATRISTS
There are, roughly, ten thousand psychiatrists in the United States. Everyone agrees that this is not

 nearly enough. For the country as a whole, there is one psychiatrist for every sixteen thousand peo- ple. Clearly this is an alarming ratio. In 1953 a Congressional Inquiry on Mental Illness (45) con- cluded with the judgment that we need twice as many psychiatrists at once. There is little reason to believe that we shall find them. Blain (3) points out that after allowing for loss due to death and retirement from the field, we are presently gaining about 450 psychiatrists a year. At this rate, he figures that it will be twenty years before we double the number of psychiatrists in this country. But as our population continues to grow too, and as the rate of mental disorder in the population continues to increase (Figure 3), the need rises along with the supply of psychiatrists.
There are facts which make Blain's figures on our rate of gain in psychiatry cause for even more con- cern. Gorman (17) calls attention to the follow- ing: "Of the approximately 450 doctors [each year] who complete the three-year psychiatric residency, an average of 250 go into private practice. This leaves public psychiatry with about 200 recruits, little more than enough to replace the older psy- chiatrists who die off or retire."
There is a further effect of the tendency of the new psychiatrist to go into private practice show- ing up in the shortage of research personnel in psychiatry. Research in psychiatry requires even
further specialized training and experience. The Group for the Advancement of Psychiatry (18) notes that: "Despite increased facilities and sums available for research in psychiatry, the present trend of psychiatric trainees is to enter into the private practice of psychiatry, with emphasis on psychotherapy and the shock therapies, rather than to undertake research."
There is another pessimistic factor to be con- sidered. A sizable number (20 per cent to 25 per cent—see below) of residents in psychiatry are non- resident aliens who return home after their train- ing, reducing still further the number of psychia- trists available for public institutions and agencies.
It is clear that we cannot help but fall behind even the present inadequate psychiatrist-patient ratios in our public institutions. One result is that, as states appropriate more funds to their depart- ments of mental health, they begin to compete with each other for personnel. Time (47) quotes Indi- ana's Governor Craig: "Eventually we will have to stop this bidding against each other. There has to be some common ground of salaries and mutual consideration. . . . These interstate raids on men- tal-health institutions for personnel sometimes get to be like the raids to build up rival football teams."
In some areas of the country the shortage of psychiatrists is much more acute than the national average. Felix (12) has called attention to the

situation in the southern region where a survey of sixteen states indicates an immediate need for five times as many psychiatrists as are presently available.
What possible approaches are there to alleviat- ing this critical shortage? Among those most often mentioned is the suggestion that we expand our programs for training psychiatrists, and attract more physicians, especially new medical school graduates, into the field.
What are our chances of increasing, really sig- nificantly, the number of psychiatrists in relation to our need for psychiatric service?
The supply of psychiatrists is linked in a very real sense to the supply of physicians, and to the number of young physicians who decide to spe- cialize in psychiatry. Despite strenuous efforts made in recent years to encourage more young physicians to enter into psychiatric residencies, there has been no proportionate increase and, in fact, there has been some ground lost in the past three years. Figure 4 shows the total number of residencies offered in four important medical spe- cialties over the past few years, and indicates no relative gain by psychiatry. For many years the proportion of physicians indicating a limited spe- cialty in psychiatry has remained quite constant between the limits of 54 per cent to 7 per cent (36).

Another indication of the fairly level output of 125.8 per cent. In 1910 there were 3,165 physi-
trained psychiatrists is the number who pass the examinations of the American Board of Examiners in Psychiatry and Neurology each year. Figure 5 illustrates these figures and also shows the even lower level of output in neurology. The number who pass both specialties together is negligible.
Because the supply of psychiatrists is so bound to the supply of physicians, we may well look fur- ther at the latter. Few subjects are so loaded with potential for polemics as the question of whether or not there are enough physicians in this country and whether or not their numbers are increasing or decreasing in comparison with the growth of our population. One of the favorite arguments for ad- vocates of either point of view is to engage in com- parisons between "then and now." The problem is how to choose the most equitable "then." For ex- ample, Turner (33) argues that there are increas- ing numbers of physicians being trained. He says, "While the population of the nation has approxi- mately doubled during this period [1900-1954], in
cians graduated from approved medical schools as compared to 6,861 in 1954, the latter figure repre- senting an increase of 114.8 per cent."3
The trouble, if there is trouble, with Turner's argument is to be found in the expression "ap- proved schools of medicine." In 1910 Flexner
(14) published a monumental report of an in- vestigation of medical schools. He classed 66 as Class A "Approved" schools and 65 as Class B and C "Unapproved" schools. The "Unapproved" schools had, that year, an enrollment of 8,996 students, which, if added to that in "Approved" schools, brings the total enrollment up to 21,526. This figure, if used as a basis for comparison, would mean an increase in enrollment of only 35.8 per cent instead of the 125.8 per cent (125.28 per cent) quoted above. The "Unapproved" schools graduated 1,275 physicians in 1910 making a total

ratio was 1.97to 1." They go on to point out that if the fall in applicants continues just a few more years there will not be enough people to fill medical school vacancies. Other medical educators, writing in the Journal oj Medical Education, warn that "the caliber of applicants to medical schools is falling" (15), and that some schools withgeo- graphic restrictions "had to 'scrape the bottom of the barrel'" (31). We conclude that for the next few years at least, the prospects are not favorable for a major increase in medical school enrollments.
These facts and trends in the supply of physi- cians and medical school enrollments indicate that there is little likelihood of the kind of increase that would be needed to result in a substantial rise in the number of psychiatrists. Increasing justmod- erately the number of medical school graduates would only slightly affect the number of newpsy- chiatric residents because, as a rule of thumb, the number of first-year residents in psychiatry each year is less than 10 per cent of medical school graduation figures.
There is, however, another source of psychiatric residents, and of residents in other specialties as well, which has appeared in recent years. Alien physicians, in increasing numbers, have been ac-
cepted as interns and residents in hospitals in this country. During the past five years the number of alien physicians in all residencies has increased from 8 per cent to 22 per cent. Most of these alien physicians have entered the U. S. under provisions of the U. S. Information and Exchange Act of1948.
Some 20 per cent to 25 per cent of the physicians now in residencies in psychiatry are from abroad and will return home when their training iscom- pleted ( 7 ) . While they offer service during their stay here, they do not represent any permanent in- crease in psychiatric manpower and actually their numbers inflate artificially figures on psychiatric residents in training.
PSYCHOLOGISTS
It is more difficult to define a psychologist than a psychiatrist and meaningful data are harder to obtain for psychology. While many persons em- ployed as psychiatrists have not had as muchspe- cialized training in psychiatry as leaders in the field might prescribe, at least a specified minimum of training is required in that all psychiatrists are physicians and have had the extensive clinical con- tact with patients that medical training involves. Psychology, on the other hand, is a broader and • more loosely denned field in which are employed people with various amounts of formal training. In this respect psychology is more like such spe- cialties as chemistry or engineering than it is like psychiatry.
A second difficulty, for our present purposes, in- volves deciding what proportion of psychologists may be considered to be in the field of mental health. Should we include only clinical psycholo- gists? Certainly people working in vocational guidance, in school psychology, and even some of those concerned with such areas as morale and motivation of military personnel, to cite but a few examples, may be thought of as contributing to mental health. There is no question but that a sizable number of psychologists would argue that they have no direct, and scarcely any indirect, con- cern with mental health. The scientist studying color vision, or the rodentologist with his T-maze, is not likely to welcome classificatory bedfellowship with the professional tester or counselor.
In some of the data we will present below we will use figures based on membership in the Ameri- can Psychological Association. Our rationalization
 is as follows: over half of the membership of APA is in clinical psychology or closely related areas (30). The total membership of APA is estimated to number about one-half of those employed in this country as psychologists (39). The reader should keep in mind that a sizable proportion of APA members have little or nothing to do with mental health, but that a sizable number of psychologists who are employed in the mental health field are not APA members. The exactness of the balance of these two groups is almost impossible to assess.
What sort of demands for services of psycholo- gists exists in the field of mental health? Once again one has a choice of estimates (2, 3, 11, 12, 20, 28). It is probably safe to say that existing needs could absorb easily an additional ten thou- sand trained people.
Most studies emphasize the need for people at the doctorate level. The Committee on Specialized Personnel of the Office of Defense Mobilization
(28) estimates that PhD's with research experi- ence are in shortest supply, particularly in physio- logical and experimental psychology. On the other hand, the Veterans Administration, projecting its needs for the next decade, indicates a continuing serious shortage of PhD-level clinical psychologists (see Figure 8). Felix (12) says that the southern region (sixteen states) needs seven times as many

clinical psychologists as are now employed, and that eleven western states need a total of 2,000 clinical psychologists.
There is a pervasive belief among psychologists that psychology is one of the fastest-growing fields of specialization. Sanford (29) noted in 1951 that the membership of APA increased nearly twenty- fold in a quarter century. He quotes the extrapo- lation of psychology's growth curve by Boring in which the latter predicts 59 million psychologists a century hence. Carrying the extrapolation fur- ther, Sanford notes that the number of psycholo- gists will catch up with the world's population in less than 150 years! Fortunately, perhaps, there are signs that we are slowing down. Wolfle (39) has shown that the notion of very rapid growth in psychology is only partially true.
For each year of the past five years the number of new Associates of APA has remained fairly con- stant at about 1,300. Figure 9 illustrates the growth of the APA and, for contrast, the growth of the American Psychiatric Association. If, how- ever, we look at the number of PhD's in psychol- ogy and the number of first-year residents in psy- chiatry we see no startling gain for either group
(Figure 10).
Will our universities be able to turn out enough
people to fill the present and projected need for psychologists? The best predictions are that for the next few years we will not step up the number

ogy can expand training programs somewhat more readily as more qualified college graduates are at- tracted to the field. The more serious limitation on numbers of psychologists trained is the supply of college graduates forming the pool of potential graduate students, especially the number of p s y - chology majors. Figure 11 contrasts the numbers of bachelor's, master's, and doctor's degrees c o n - ferred in psychology since 1947-48. It will be noted that while there has been a steady increase in the number of doctorates conferred in psychol- ogy, the number of bachelor's degrees has declined along with the decline in college graduates in gen- eral. It seems certain that the next several years will see a drop, or at least a leveling off, in num- bers of doctorates as graduate school enrollments fall off with the shortage of college graduates we have noted.
A further problem that promises to affect p s y - chology somewhat more than the other mental health fields is the oncoming tide of college s t u - dents described above. The psychologist tradi- tionally has been a teacher, and as psychology is one of the most popular undergraduate subjects there will be an increased demand for college teachers of psychology. This increased demand will follow a decade or so of fairly low-levelpro- duction of doctorates in psychology.
What can the field of psychology do in the face of these prospects of shortages and static output? Is there any way to increase the number of trained psychologists? One thing which comes to mind at once is the value of taking steps now to get infor- mation about scientific and professional opportuni- ties in psychology to students who have not yet chosen their career, and to students majoring in psychology who are not well acquainted with the possibilities of further training. The recent Public Affairs Pamphlet on psychology ( 2 6 ) is one small step in the right direction. Despite the low tide of college students now enrolled, psychology should be able to attract a somewhat larger proportionof able students. Psychology, it should be noted, is the only one of the mental health professions that
has real continuing access to the attention of large numbers of college students before they have made firm decisions on their careers.
More psychology undergraduates might go on to graduate school if large university departments im- proved their contact with these students. Wolfle

of doctorates (39). In fact there will probably be some decline for a time.
University training centers for psychologists en- joy a certain advantage over psychiatric training centers from the point of view of flexibility in ex- panding training programs. While psychiatry must depend on the supply of physicians for its recruits, and also must depend on specialists who are in short supply for its training supervisors, psychol-

(39) notes that only 12 per cent of students who
 major in psychology have become professional psy- chologists. But as psychology bachelors comprise a representative cross-section of ability of all those receiving bachelor's degrees, many more than 12 per cent have the intellectual ability to succeed in graduate school (39).
Whatever we do to increase graduate enrollments during the next decade the shortage of psycholo- gists is likely to continue. Some ten to twenty years hence we should be able to increase sizably our output of doctorates. But as we have noted, demands increase as our population increases. There seems little chance that we will have enough psychologists even then.
SOCIAL WORKERS
It was harder to define who is a psychologist than who is a psychiatrist. It is harder still to de- fine who is a social worker.
According to Kendall (21), 'It has been esti- mated that there are approximately 75,000 persons employed in social work positions in the United States, of whom 16 per cent have completed two or more years of graduate study, 11 per cent have had one, but less than two years, 13 per cent have had less than one year, and 60 per cent have had no social work education."
We will be guided in our considerations of num- bers of social workers, and trends in their number, by statements of leaders of the profession itself as to who are social workers. Youngdahl (41) says, "At present the established norm for professional training consists of two years of graduate profes- sional training in an accredited school of social work." This definition agrees with the one used by the Health Resources Advisory Committee (20).
What is the present need for social workers in the mental health field? Let us turn once more to our sources and select some typical estimates. Blain (3) sees a need for 9,000 psychiatric social workers and figures it will take 20 years to find this number. The present shortage in state-sup- ported mental hospitals alone is approximately 7,000 (2) which represents a 75 per cent under- staffing (24). Gorman (17) counts only 800 psy- chiatric social workers in state institutions, which represents an even greater understaffing. At this rate, each social worker has, on the average, re-
sponsibility for six hundred patients. In 1952 there were 2,500 budgeted job vacancies for medi- cal and psychiatric social workers in this country
and a projected need for 4,200 more within five years (20). In these two specialties alone it is estimated that there is a deficit of at least 1,000 each year even if every graduate goes to work (20). Comparable shortages exist in all other fields of social work (12, 16, 21). The Council on Social Work Education (5) estimates that 50,000 new so- cial workers will be needed in the next decade, be- yond those who may leave the field.
How many social workers are being trained? Figure 12 illustrates the ten-year trend in num- bers of full-time students and graduates from two- year programs as compiled by the Council on So- cial Work Education. Once again we observe the postwar rise, but the decline has come earlier in social work than in the other two fields we have studied. From what we have said about the pool of potential professional school students, it will be apparent that the rise in numbers of social work students will be slow. Different specialties within social work show different trends. There has been a decrease in field placements in medical social work and in group work over the past four years and a slight increase in field placements in psychi- atric social work during this same time. All other fields of social work have about held their own (6).

 68 THE AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGIST
A survey in 1952 of 24 schools of social work with approved medical social work curricula showed that the number of students enrolled in this spe- cialty fell short of capacity by 42 per cent, while other schools without specialized curricula but with medical social work field placements were 58 per cent below capacity. It is estimated that these discrepancies between enrollment and vacancies still exist (20) and it is our impression that similar vacancies exist in other social work specialties. Kendall (21) notes that "many of the graduate schools are operating at less than full capacity."
Many reasons have been suggested for the diffi- culties in recruiting social work students and for the growing shortages in the field. One fact is that a high proportion of members of the profession are women (20) who leave the field. Other factors have been suggested by Eaton (9) and include low pay, prestige conflicts, and multiple identifications.
Leaders in social work are trying to step up re- cruitment activities. Among the more frequent ef- forts are programs of on-the-job training for col- lege students during the summer, workshops for college teachers in sociology and anthropology, visits by social work faculty to career conferences on college campuses, and work-study programs for those who cannot afford to spend two years in full- time graduate school study. It should be noted that this last effort, work-study programs, does little to increase the number of social workers, as a majority taking part in these programs are al- ready in the field.
Nothing in view leads to optimistic predictions concerning the problem of finding students for so- cial work in the numbers that are needed. Leaders in the field are making all sorts of active and imaginative efforts, however, and the other profes- sions can learn much from social work in this re- spect.
DISCUSSION
Let us review briefly the important points bear- ing on manpower trends and prospects in the three disciplines we have discussed.
We believe that there is wholehearted unanimity among knowledgeable people about the staggering dimensions of the mental health needs of the na- tion. From whatever viewpoint, be it humani- tarian, economic, or scientific, mental disorder is far and away our number one health problem. It
is real, it is now, and it will not go away. It will only get worse.
Everyone who is aware of the problem agrees that the need for trained professional personnel in the mental health field is desperate. The stark re- ality is that we cannot even keep up present num- bers in proportion to the population. We have not found a single optimistic voice. Occasionally some- one suggests a crash program with recruiting drives, publicity, subsidized training, and special induce- ments to lure more students into training programs. If the mental health professions were the only ones where personnel shortages existed, such pro- grams might be effective in increasing our output of trained people a few years hence. But shortages are not specific to our own fields. They are part of a more pervading shortage of scientific and professional personnel in general. Our pessimistic facts are duplicated in the shortages of teachers, nurses, engineers, and scientists.
But there must be other solutions to the mental health problem. Typhoid fever was not controlled by treating the disease. What about mental health research leading to prevention, or faster cures? As Hastings (19) puts it: "Without more basic knowl- edge than we have today or are now accumulating, the people who follow us fifty years hence will be struggling with the same problems that we are. The almost limitless future for the psychological sciences in the years ahead lies along the avenue of well-planned research activity done by many disciplines."
Psychologists probably receive more formal re- search training than do members of the other two fields. But it is our general impression, and this would be readily testable, that there is an inverse relation between the amount of time psychologists spend on basic research and their proximity to the field of mental health. The clinical psychologist all too often is loaded with service responsibilities, and his research, when he finds time for it, is likely to be concerned with evaluating or improving his skills and techniques rather than being a more basic attack on etiology or pathology. The social worker, too, is trained for service, and despite the growing emphasis on a research orientation in the social work curriculum, a scanning of the social work journals fails to turn up any really basic re- search. We have already noted the shortage of research-oriented psychiatrists.
In recent months there has been a wave of en-
 thusiasm for the tranquilizing drugs as an aid to speedier and more effective therapy. These early reports would seem to be encouraging indications that research can be productive even at the present rate of expenditure. Let us hope fervently that the reports are all based on careful study, though experience warns us to be cautious about such en- thusiasms. The memory of "focal infections" and "rest cures" and even electroconvulsive therapy bids us be careful. Worse still, if the new drugs fulfill even a portion of their promise we will be worse off than before, for most everyone agrees that the drugs are effective only in combination with psychotherapy. So hospitalized patients who formerly did not see a psychiatrist for long periods are now lining up outside his door.
Much is already known about mental disorder. Whether we agree about causes, at least we can agree that there probably are prophylactic and pre- ventive measures which can be effective if used early enough. One of the important aspects of pre- vention is work with children, or with parents in order to reach children. Again, while there are notable exceptions, and in this area perhaps a few exceptional people can be most influential, we find the usual shortages and lack of interest. Blain
(3) despairs at the trickle of child psychiatrists being turned out—some forty a year—and shows that at this rate of production it will take fifteen years to provide one child psychiatrist each for the 600 clinics needed today, not to mention the de- mands of children's residential homes, juvenile courts, school systems, etc. Similar shortages exist for child workers in the other mental health professions.
What is left? One fairly radical proposal has been made by Hastings (19) (though he credits the idea to Kubie and others). He suggests the creation of a new professional group, trained as psychotherapists, though not required to master all of the knowledge presently in the various profes- sional curricula. These people, who could be trained much more rapidly than can a psychiatrist or a psychologist, would not take over completely the field of therapy but would augment present per- sonnel and perhaps free more highly trained people for research. The obstacles to the implementation of this suggestion are enormous, as Hastings recog- nizes. Another profession on the scene might even increase present shortages in the established pro- fessions, and resistance from many quarters to such
infringement on sovereignty would be strong. But the suggestion is an intriguing one, and what we need (besides personnel, money, facilities, and skill) are ideas which can be implemented.
We can only conclude this survey with the pre- diction that our country will continue to be faced with personnel shortages in psychiatry, psychology, and social work for years to come. Barring the possibility of a massive national effort in all areas of education, or the possibility of a sharp break- through in mental health research, the prospects are pessimistic for improvements in the quantity or quality of service in the field of mental health.

Itililor's note. At the Board of Directors meeting held February 13-15, 1969, funds were authorized to conduct a Conference on Recruitment. Such a conference was held April 18-20, 1969, arranged for and chaired by George Albee. A report of this conference was prepared by Albcc and was presented to the Board of Directors at its meeting on May 1S-T7, 1969. After careful consideration of the
Report of the Conference, the report was "Received with lhanks by the Al'A Board of Directors and was referred to the APA governance for study and recommendation,noting that individuals in the field and in funding agencies should also play a role." Such action by the Board of Directors will insure continued attention by APA boards and com- mittees to those appropriate matters and issues discussed with representatives of the Association of Black Psycholo- gists and to the mallei's symbolized by the Statement of Concern.

Chairmen, and the Committee on Equality of Op- portunity in .Psychology, invited persons with special technical competence, and resource people from Federal agencies and from the staff of APA.
In the course of the discussions the Conference participants became increasingly aware of the ex- tent of underrepresentation of minority groups in psychology; they became impressed, too, with the urgency with which those in American psychology must act both to put our own house in order and to set an example to other organizations that may be expected to be encouraged to follow our lead. For example, we were impressed with the facts, well documented by the Committee on Equality of Opportunity in Psychology, that the 10 most prestigious departments of psychology in the United States granted only 8 PhDs in psychology to Negro candidates between 1920 and 1966 while granting a total of 3,767 PhDs during this period; six of these leading departments had not had a single Negro PhD. Of the largest producers of PhDs during this period fewer than 1 % of the doctorates were won by black students. (Tt is these same departments, we cannot resist noting, that supply the bulk of psychological consultation to Federal
training and research programs.)
The Conference participants are aware of the
fact that deeply held attitudes and behavior pat- terns cannot be legislated out of existence and that pious platitudes cannot change the world. But we also are aware that leaders who truly lead can often mobilize widespread readiness for positive action, and so we urge the APA Council, boards, and committees, and our whole organizational and staff structure, to provide leadership in expanding the opportunities for black and other minority group students and faculty to enter the mainstream of psychology.
The tenor of the discussion was serious and con- cerned, and seldom unreasonable. Participants generally agreed that large efforts had to be made at all levels—making opportunities available in

 graduate departments for qualified black and other minority group students, with special financial as- sistance earmarked; improving the quality of under- graduate education in psychology at predominant!}' black colleges; recruiting more able undergraduates to these departments; improving the educational opportunities in elementary and secondary schools for disadvantaged students; and working to elimi- nate the effects of racism throughout our society. At the same time it was recognized that there is an important substantive body of knowledge in psy- chology and that graduate work makes strenuous
demands. One of the black participants said it well: "There is a great need to avoid the encourage- ment, implicit or otherwise, of 'half-baked,' non- scientific black departments of psychology for the production of instant black psychologists whose only forte would be some vague 'community psy- chology'." This same man spoke of the urgency of "recruiting and holding capable faculty mem- bers, updating and in most instances creating adequate facilities for laboratory experiences, up- dating and increasing library resources, and offering financial support to students who frequently are indigent."
We were impressed with the findings of the Wispe Committee on Equal Opportunities that more than half of all Negro psychologists live in the South, and an even higher percentage were born there and received their bachelor's degrees there. We agree with this Committee that "More active steps should be taken . . . to recruit and train for careers in psychology graduates from Negro colleges, especially located in the South."
studying the problems of recruiting minority group students for careers in psychology, and is presently preparing a proposal that, after being approved by APA governance, will go to the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH). Tt is the belief of the Committee that existing programs such as the National Science Foundation Visiting Scientist Pro- gram, the Careers-in-Psychology program, etc., are not especially suitable for this purpose; their proposal will use integrated visiting teams carrying out a carefully planned program.
We note the encouraging fact that the prestigious Council of Graduate Department Chairmen has appointed a committee to concern itself with ways of encouraging the admission of more black and other minority group students into graduate study in psychology. We urge this organization to find creative ways quickly, and we concur with the recommendation of the Wispe Committee that "More elasticity in admission requirements for graduate training should be considered by the . . . Conference of Graduate Department Chairmen."
The matter of admission requirements, par- ticularly the predictive value of highly verbal tests, is a complex subject, but the Conference spent some time discussing these problems. While recognizing that verbal tests are unquestionably predictive of college and graduate school grades in a system that emphasizes verbal performance, the Conference also noted the relatively low predictive value of graduate school classroom performance for later scientific or professional success.

In this regard there was discussion of the ques-
tion of the relevance of much of the content of graduate education in psychology to critical human problems on which man's survival itself may de- pend—problems like war, overpopulation, racism, and the increasing pollution of our social and physical environment. APA cannot tell university departments what to teach, but we do know enough about reinforcement theory to suggest that both

sional concern with these problems. We note with approval that the theme of the 1969 Annual ATA Convention is "Psychology and Problems of So- ciety."
Each board and committee, each division of APA, and each state psychological association should examine its current activities and its com- mittee structure to see what steps it can take to deal with current problems of the black psycholog- ical community.
We encourage divisions and stale associations to devote more attention in their newsletters and at their annual programs to the creation of a climate that encourages the application of psychological research and knowledge to reduce racism and the problems it creates. We would hope, for example, that those divisions and state associations that sponsor postdoctoral institutes and workshops might devote time to the psychological aspects of racism.
We suggest that divisional and state psycholog- ical groups consider what they might do to acquaint qualified minority group students in high schools and colleges with career opportunities in psy- chology; we recommend also that some of the obvious energies of the state associations, so long expended in legislative and other professional matters, be directed toward finding creative ways of increasing the number of disadvantaged students in undergraduate and graduate programs in psy- chology and increasing the participation of black psychologists in psychological association programs.
Among the other recommendations coming out of the Conference are the following:
We would ask APA to recommend that NTMH add extra stipends to existing training grants, stipends specifically earmarked for higher risk minority group students who might be encouraged in some cases to spend a "bridge year" in courses selected as preparatory to graduate study.
We further urge that APA use its influence with NIMH, the Office of Education, and the Social Rehabilitation Service to seek new and effective ways to fund programs for minority group students, especially at the undergraduate level, with the goal of increasing the pool of potential graduate students for the human service professions. Such support might carry over to the early years of graduate school in the way Social Science Research Council support is now given.
In this context we would also ask that Federal granting agencies make a more effective effort at involving qualified black and other minority group psychologists and social scientists on their panels, study sections, and staffs. As noted elsewhere in this report the most prestigious universities, which supply a large proportion of government consult- ants and panel members, have not been distinguished as producers of black PhDs and so may not be expected to have special qualifications in this gen- eral area.
The Education and Training Board of APA has extensive contacts with nearly every graduate doc- toral program in the country. Questions asked by its site visitors receive careful attention and may promote desirable changes. While the Education and Training Board cannot and should not dictate admissions or patterns of graduate training it could seek out and encourage demonstration programs more consistent with the needs of minority group students and experimentation with curriculum changes.
As another example of what APA could do, the Committee on Subdoctoral Education in Psychology could develop recommendations for special pro- grams designed to remedy critical shortages in such fields as MA-level black counselors for community colleges or of Mexican-American and Puerto Rican school psychologists. The various curriculum pro- grams being developed can focus on problems of relevance and also on recruitment of minority group students. It is expected that representatives of the Association of Black Psychologists and other minority groups might make useful contributions to these developments.
The AP A Committee on Precollege Psychology and the Division 2 Committee on Psychology in the High Schools could pay special attention to the problems of largely black or Mexican-American or Puerto Rican high schools.
We cite these merely as examples of actions pos- sible at many levels of APA governance structure.
One of the recurring themes throughout the Conference was the urgent need for black role models in psychology—persons who might be ex- amples to black undergraduates of the opportunities available to them in psychology. Because of the relatively small number of black psychologists and especially black college teachers, and because the large and affluent largely white universities are
 hiring black faculty away from the predominantly black southern colleges, this is an increasingly serious need.
We recommend that APA develop a series of training films featuring black and other minority group psychologists for use in classrooms in both largely black and largely white institutions. APA's demonstrated competence in this area (e.g., "Focus on Behavior") and the potential attractiveness of such a project to NIMH suggest that this proposal be given high priority by the Board.
Numerous other examples will occur to members of various boards and committees to whom we hope the Board will direct proposals for action.
The Conference noted with concern the fact that a large number of black psychologists belong neither to APA nor to state or local psychological associations. While there may have been good reasons in the past why these psychologists felt that APA, and the other professional groups, had little to offer them, it is our hope that this situation no longer obtains. Other special groups in psy- chology have found that an organized effort, even by a relatively small number, can have dramatic effects on the APA governance structure, including changes in the distribution of budgeted activities; black and other minority group psychologists may note that this Conference, and many other cur- rent APA activities, have been triggered by the
"Statement of Concerns" of the Association of Black Psychologists presented to Council in Oc- tober 1968. We hope this lesson is not lost and that organizational activity within APA by black psychologists will increase.
The Conference asked that APA use its influence to assure itself of nondiscriminating practices among its service users and contractors—printers, ad- vertisers, employer listings, etc. A statement to this effect should be carried in contracts, promo- tional material, and publications.
We also recommend to the Editor that a new and regularly scheduled section of the American Psychologist be created, to report on "Psychology and Problems of Society," which might serve as a source of information to our members about signifi- cant developments in research, in Federal and state programming, and in the activity of our science as a means of promoting human welfare.
We further recommend that eventually a position be created in the Central Office under the general direction of the Executive Officer to be concerned with relating psychology to social problems includ- ing those dealt with in this report.
We urge that the Board of Directors of APA approve the spirit of these recommendations and refer them as appropriate for action to boards, committees, divisions, and state associations.

#### A Re-analysis of the Reliability of Psychiatric Diagnosis
##### Introduction
Classification systems such as diagnosis have two primary properties, reliability and validity. Reliability refers to the consistency with which subjects are classified; validity, to the utility of the system for its various purposes. In the case of psychiatric diagnosis, the purposes of the classification system are communication about clinical features, aetiology, course of illness and treatment. A necessary constraint on the validity of the system is its reliability. There is no guarantee that a reliable system is valid, but assuredly an unreliable system must be invalid.

##### Background

Studies of the reliability of psychiatric diagnosis provide information on the upper limits of its validity. This study will consider some of the difficulties in appraising diagnostic reliability, offers a re-analysis of the available data from the literature, and suggests a possible course of action to improve psychiatric diagnosis.

##### Rationale

Zubin (1967) reviewed the major studies of reliability of psychiatric diagnosis performed until 1966. He noted that diagnostic reliability is referred to in three different ways: agreement between independent diagnosticians examining the same patients, stability in diagnosis over time, and similarity in diagnostic frequencies for comparable samples. It is the first sense—interjudge agreement—that is fundamental.

Recent studies of interjudge agreement of psychiatric (Schmidt and Fonda, 1956; Kreitman, 1961; Beck et al., 1962; Sandifer et al., 1964) report on agreement as to the presence of absence of a diagnosis, but they neglect to consider the rate at which diagnoses are made.

Cohen (1960) has recently developed a statistical measure (called 'kappa') of interjudge agreement that incorrporates a correction for chance agreement. This study proposes to recalculate the reliability of psychiatric diagnosis from these studies based on Cohen's Kappa.
##### Experimental Design

The study will use existing data, culled from five recent papers measuring the interjudge agreement of psychiatric diagnosis.

##### Significance and Contributions

There is little doubt that the reliability of psychiatric diagnosis is being questioned at this time. If the presumed agreement of previous work depends merely on the rate of chance agreement, psychiatry must reevaluate it classification system immediately.

The point of all this is that the social dis- approval of the social consequences of be- havior usually identifies the underlying "dis- ease." In the absence of these interactions the disease would not exist.

and the confounding effects of unsuspected or uncontrolled variables that have led to premature "discoveries." He concludes that of all the new reports of toxic materials in the blood of schizophrenics "there has been no extensive substantiation of any of them" (p. 418). He continues: "Many of the cur- rent hypotheses concerning the schizophre- nia complex are original and attractive even though, up to this time, evidence directly implicating anyone of them in the disease itself is hardly compelling" (p. 426).
If there is no convincing evidence that schizophrenia is an identifiable disease, there is far less scientific support for a sickness model explanation of all of the less extreme forms of human deviation, yet the American Psychiatric Association keeps issuing posi- tion statements claiming responsibility for such conditions as mental retardation, ju- ~enile delinquency, and alcoholism. The
1rouble is that the sickness model demands ;a kind of intervention that is terribly ex- 'PCnsiveand a kind of highly trained inter- vener who is not widely available. Even- tually, I predict, the needs of society will be better served! •

Look!
With hundreds of thousands of daily drug users in the public hospitals, plus millions more seeking tranquility or at least relief from intense anxiety, the psychotropic drugs have become a fantastic growth industry. Understandably any threat to the sickness model is a threat to the drug salesmen. What is good for General Napoleon is good for United Chemical!
By using drugs for the poor in the state hospitals we can get by with practically no professional personnel in these tax-sup- ported settings. (In over one-third of our state hospitals practically no psychiatric
. time is available, and two-thirds of our 2,000 psychiatric clinics do not have a single full-time psychiatrist on the staff[ 1] ) . Eighty percent of psychiatric practice is pri- vate office practice with a suburban upper- middle class clientele.
Jules Henry (5) says: "State hospitals to- day seem to exhale from their antique bricks and dark labyrinths the miasmas of mis- understanding, prejudice, .callousness, and hate whose origins lie deep in pur history. Who knows what happens in the pit, where their voices do not come up to us?" (p. 48).
The point of all of this argument should not be lost. Psychiatry, in insisting on its prerogatives of primary patient responsibility and control of treatment institutions and intervention efforts of all sorts, bases its argument either on rare and uncertain genetic and metabolic conditions or on those common chronic organic mental conditions which it characteristically neglects. Most of psychiatric practice is private, most of it is suburban, and most hospital psychiatry is practiced in general hospitals. None of the organic mental conditions is the central con- cern of current psychiatric treatment.
A great majority of the people whom psy- chiatrists treat are not suffering from genetic, metabolic, and arteriosclerotic conditions, or from alcoholic delirium, or from central ner- vous system malfunction. If psychiatrists were to devote their primary attention to these kinds of cases there would be little need for today's debate about models. Repeatedly,

arguing for its replacement with a social- developmental model. Certainly the most fundamental contribution of Freud was his discovery of the continuity between the nor- mal and the abnormal. In discussing Dar- win and Freud, Jerome Bruner pointed out that the Victorians, reeling from Darwin's discovery of a perfectly lawful continuity be- tween man and the rest of the animal king- dom, were dealt a second and more terrifying blow by Freud's discovery of the continuity between the sane and the insane. Bruner( 3 ) speaks of the
state hospitals and public clinics would be replaced by social intervention centers, largely staffed by people at the bachelor's level-more like special education teachers and social welfare workers, potentially avail- able in vastly greater supply than psychol- ogists and psychiatrists. For prevention, peo- ple like ourselves would be needed as teachers, researchers, and especially as rad- ical social activists proselytizing for changes in our society to make it more supportive, less dehumanized.
The massive deterioration of the fabric of soc[ety and its institutions results in a com-
. . . lawful continuity between man and the
animal kihgdom, between dreams and unrea- plex tangle of pathology. The pathology
son on one side and waking rationality on the other, between madness and sanity, between consciousness and unconsciousness; between the mind of the child and the adult mind, be-
includes especially the destruction of the emotional integrity of the family. Let me emphasize here something that you already know very well. Many significant research breakthroughs have already been made. Many of the discoveries are already in. We know, for example, that the emoti6nal cli- mate which surrounds the infant and young child is of critical importance in determining his future-including the kind, the severity, and perhaps even the biological concomi- tants of his later disturbance.
Such knowledge is dangerous. We usually shut our eyes to its implications. We go on trying to fix up damaged adults in one-to- one relationships when a more proper pro- fessional function would be to spend a con- siderable portion of our energies trying to fix up our society in ways that will increase the strength and stability of the family, there- by affecting positively the mental health of generations to come. It is not possible here to further elaborate upon prevention except to say that I believe, because of the nature of the human animal, it must take the form of strengthening the institution of the family.
I believe that history may judge President Johnson to have been one of the most com- plicated of American presidents. But his speech at Howard University's commence- ment will be judged among the half-dozen great landmarks in the history of our society. In it the President called for a massive attack on the central problem of our time. He said:

these has been a cherished discontinuity pre- served in doctrinal canons.
Freud forced the abandonment of thes~ cherished discontinuities.
Why, in the face of this central message of Freud's life work, does the latter-day psy- choanalyst continue to pay homage to the sickness model? Primarily, I think, because of the historical accident which has re- quired the psychoanalyst in the United States to be trained first as a physician. I look for- ward to the day when the psychoanalysts, perhaps in continuing self-analysis, will join forces with Freud and the rest of us who be- lieve the evidence supports a continuity mod- el, a model which holds that it is established that the same mechanisms are operating in adaptive and maladaptive human behavior, and will help lead the scientific assault on those who seek to preserve and defend the sickness model.

O PERANT CON DITIOIUING :
ROLE IN HI..'MIAN BEI{AuOR Edward Stork
From infancy onward, conditioning plays a major role in our lives. Yet most of us tend to downplay that role, possibly feeling that to admit such control over our behavior would be to admit that our lives are overly determined. Often when students read in their texts about classical and operant conditioning, tJrey tend to associate that type of leaming with infrahuman animals. That is, "Dogs, rats, and pigeons are aflected by conditioning, but it doesn't play any role in my behavior." This activity is designed to provide a starting point for discussion of conditioning in humans.
While discussing operant conditioning, intermpt your lecture with "Oh, by the way, before I forget again" and then ask a question to which you know you will get either an almost totally positive or negative response. For example, if your students are primarily seniors, you might say, "f was supposed to ask, how many of you have signed for a diploma for graduation?" All students will usually raise a hand. Then tell them to hold the position they are in and ask if anyone told them to raise their hands or even mentioned raising hands.
The usual response is a chorus of groans as the students recognize that they have been "used." Discuss the activit5i as an example of human conditioning. Ask students to generate other examples that describe conditioning in humans. You can use the ensuing discussion as a bridge to talking about conditioning techniques used with humans in behavior therapy.

LJNTCAL psychology has entered a paradox- Cical phase in its development where its prob- lems of identity and relevance threaten it with extinction at the same time that its oppor- tunities seem boundless. The demand for clinical psychologists far exceeds the number available or
being trained. While able undergraduates in greater numbers than ever before are knocking on the doors of our graduate schools seeking admission to clinical training programs, these schools are ac- cepting fewer clinical students. Indeed, clinical programs are being dropped or sharply curtailed by many prestigious universities.
Professional psychologists are increasingly critical of existing graduate programs, charging that the curriculum is irrelevant and inappropriate and that deliberate efforts are being made to dry up the supply of future clinicians.
What are some of the forces responsible for this strange state of affairs, where everyone seems eager to expand training in clinical psychology except the field of psychology itself, particularly those fields of scientific psychology that control the graduate programs?
Let me suggest that the basic incompatibilities between the field of clinical psychology and the parent discipline have reached the point where only drastic changes may be effective in preserving the profession.
Our problems in clinical psychology are based in part on the location of our training, because this creates our ideology, our self-image, and our goals, and in part on the fundamental incompatibility of the roles of scientist and professional within one individual. Let me examine these two basic prob- lems in some detail.
Some years ago, Roger Barker suggested that a good way to predict the behavior of a human being

is to find out where he is. While I do not wish to take a position that suggests total control of behav- ior by the immediate environment, I would agree that a person does behave differently in a research lab, at a football game, in a cocktail lounge, and in an APA Council meeting. ] would also argue that for 25 years clinical psychologists have be- haved in ways responsive to the location of their training, partly in academic departments and partly in psychiatric settings. In both settings, they have
been treated as second-class citizens.
Clinical psychology is making the painful dis-
covery that academic departments of psychology in the faculty of arts and sciences are not the best places in which to train professionals and that the psychiatric setting is an unsatisfactory place to learn the ideology of practice. But it is hard to change tradition, even if tradition is only 25 years

old. Warren Bennis has observed that changing a university is about as easy as reorganizing a ceme- tery! There will be many serious obstacles to changes in the pattern of training of professional psychology. Let me direct your attention to some of these obstacles.
For one thing, clinical psychology differs in its origins from practically every other major profes- sion. Other professions began as loose organiza- tions of people delivering services needed by soci- ety, or segments of society, and the service was delivered in the marketplace. One received one's training by apprenticeship. If you wanted to be a social worker, you went to work in a settlement house or social welfare agency. Aspiring physicians were apprenticed to a practicing doctor. It was possible to "read law" in a lawyer's office. Gradu- ally, following a sociological law which says that aspiring professionals must learn theory and knowl- edge based on research before learning skills, pro-
fessional training moved onto the university campus. There it took root with separate professional facul- ties, separate professional degrees, and, for the most part, separate captive practicum training facilities where students could be apprentices of senior pro- fessionals. So, we find that all professional schools teach theory during the early part of their programs, but insure that their fledgling professionals receive extensive apprenticeship training in captive service facilities with successful practitioner role-models who often donate their time to the professional school in exchange for prerogatives such as bed privileges, honorific titles, or free office space and secretarial help.
Clinical psychology has a very different history. I will not tire you with its recitation because it is so familiar. Let me simply remind you that clinical psychology began as a small offshoot of academic, scientific psychology, growing within the confines of the graduate school where professional educa- tion was unfamiliar. In addition, I have been pointing out for several years that clinical psychol- ogy has owned no captive practicum training facil- ity of its own, and so, like the cuckoo, it has had to place its eggs in other birds' nests. In 1946, graduate departments of psychology accepted the invitation of the Veterans Administration to send clinical students for paid internships in their psy- chiatric settings. Experience in psychiatric settings quickly became mandatory—with the result that we became members of a Team in a game where we
had little influence on the rules and no choice of ballpark. Back home in the graduate department, faculty members teaching clinical courses were often nonscientific, or young, or adjunct, but in most cases low status. The clinical students had the worst of both worlds. Some adapted, some tried to outscience the scientists, and many identified with the aggressor and adopted the values and language of psychiatry. Clinical psychology does not control its own faculty appointments and pro- motions; instead, recommendations from the de- partment are made to a faculty supercommittee that consists of nonpsychologists including profes- sors from the sciences, arts, and humanities, most of whom are completely uninformed about the spe- cial needs and requirementsof a professional train- ing program. The present PhD programs in clin- ical psychology must depend for support on budgets controlled by academic vice-presidents, graduate school deans, and department chairmen, most of whom are either unsympathetic toward, or ignorant of, both the financial requirements of professional training, the need for professional staff qualified to teach skills, and the need for our own service- delivery programs for practicum training.
The establishment of separate programs for clinical psychology would be enormously expensive. Federal funding (NIMH) is the most likely source, and it is not a very promising one, not only because of sharply reduced funding in prospect, but also because historically the N I M H has served the psychiatric establishment. In view of its elimina- tion of psychology as a separate branch, together with many indicators in recent years that the powers at NIMH are engaged in decision making that reduces support of psychology training, I see no reason for optimism that very many separate schools of clinical psychology will flourish with NIMH nurturance.
The academic department is the wrong place to teach professional psychology, and the psychiatric setting is the wrong place for apprenticeship train- ing. In psychiatric settings, the clinical psycholo- gist in training learns to speak the language of psychiatry, learns to use and accept the sickness model, and often aspires to a career in the private practice of psychotherapy.
In adopting the sickness explanation from psychi- atry, the psychologist, perhaps unwittingly, sup- ports those cultural forces of reaction that delay the social changes essential to the prevention of
 emotional distress, and that bar intervention by modestly trained therapists. If mentally disturbed individuals are suffering from some unknown and undiscovered illness rather than damaged by a hostile and evil social environment, then the strat- egy for action calls for discovery of the cause of the disease rather than social action to change the dehumanizing forces of society.
Perhaps the most serious consequence for clin- ical psychology deriving from its near-total im- mersion in the psychiatric setting is that clinical psychologists and their students have been exposed to a very narrow range of human problems and, without any real opportunity to think about the matter, have accepted the psychiatric definition, confused as it is, of who is to receive our interven- tion. As a result, our selected treatment population is largely restricted to the two groups traditionally served in psychiatric settings. The first of these groups, usually found in the general hospital, espe- cially the university hospital, is the white middle- class neurotic who seeks prolonged psychothera- peutic relationships—people whom Schofield has described as having the Y A VIS syndrome (young, attractive, verbal, intelligent, and successful). The second group clinical psychology has learned to work with is the seriously disturbed poor who are incarcerated in tax-supported state and Veterans Administration hospitals. These groups are so familiar to us, and we have been brainwashed so long into believing that they represent most of the universe of emotionally disturbed people, that our textbooks, our courses, our case-seminars, our p e r - sonality theories, and our field work placements for students draw on experience with these groups. If, 25 years ago, enormously increased amounts of federal support for training in psychological inter- vention had been funneled through the public school system, rather than through psychiatric facilities, the present nature of clinical psychology would have been altogether different. Or, if psychological manpower had been supported and trained through the welfare system, we would be a still different field today.
What I am suggesting to you is that we try now standing back at as great a distance and with as much perspective as we can manage, to see what are the truly most pressing psychological problems that afflict our society, and whether clinical psy- chology, or some new field of applied psychology like community psychology, might not select these
more urgent human emotional problems as our focus after breaking free of psychiatric influence on our choice. Must we work on problems and programs only because financial support for them is available, or can we assume some responsibility for developing public awareness and then public support for intervention with the real problems of our society?
Let me suggest to you, as one example, that racism is a far more serious, pathological, and deep-seated emotional problem in our society than either the sexual neuroses of latter-day Victorians or the existential neuroses of the affluent. Racists do share some of the pathological symptoms we encounter in the clinic. The racist is delusional. He believes things to be true that are not true because such beliefs serve deep unconscious emo- tional needs, and his belief is unshakable by reason or logic. How much individual case-study have clinical psychologists done with the individual racist, and where have we studied the epidemiology of racism? Unless our society solves the problems of racism, we are not going to survive as a nation. Does this mental condition not merit our attention? Have we tried to do anything in the way of mean- ingful intervention with the racists? The mental health field has been enchanted in recent years with the development of store-front intervention centers in the slums where local indigenous workers, know- ing the language and culture, have been effective in working with the people of these depressed neighborhoods. But why has clinical psychology not opened its own store-front intervention centers in suburbia, staffed by psychologists who speak the language and understand the white suburban affluent culture, to intervene with the local inhabi- tants afflicted with racism and other virulent forms of prejudice? Why are we so much less threatened by the neuroses of sex than we are by the neuroses of hate? Perhaps, because psychiatry has had little interest in the pathology of aggression, neither have we.
Similarly, clinical psychology has paid almost no attention to the damaging emotional consequences of discrimination based on sex, and yet sexism, like racism, is almost entirely a psychological process, especially a learning process. Schizophrenia is one of the three major subjects each year in Psycho- logical Abstracts reflecting the time, energy, and resources we invest in studying this condition. T am suggesting there are other, more immediate and

pressing social problems that we should turn our attention to, problems not usually defined as "psychiatric" but which are surely psychological.
We have taught our students for years that mental cases include those people who are "danger- ous to themselves or others." But we have chosen to intervene with a very restricted range of those who are dangerous to others. Who is move danger- ous to his fellow human beings than the sophisti- cated racist? Racist attitudes and behavior, which can be found in a great many places throughout our social and economic institutions, including our state and federal governments, are far more dangerous to others than schizophrenia.
I would suggest as a further example that certain economic philosophies that are prevalent in our society are also exceptionally dangerous to others. An economic philosophy that justifies the maximiza- tion of profit at the expense of the safety, health, and happiness of the citizen should be as much a concern of the mental health worker, particularly the clinical and community psychologist, as more traditional forms of neurosis. In the last few years, I have been driven to conclude that an affluent white Protestant elite, which controls most of our major corporations and our banking system, and indirectly much of our government at all levels, engages in a mammoth, self-seeking, power- and profit-motivated enterprise which results in in- equitable distribution of jobs, resources, and health care, and affects even such fundamentals as life expectancy. The most visible victims are the urban black people, but T would hasten to point out that there arc millions of poverty-stricken whites in Appalachia and elsewhere who, together with the American Indians and the Mexican-Americans, arc
also victimized by the economic system. Women are also victimized and exploited by our system. If professional psychologists were truly concerned with human welfare, we could forget "psychiatric patients" for a century and turn our attention to the psychological causes of racism, sexism, and of the profit motive as sources of danger to the human- centered life.
I am not so quixotic as to believe that clinic;il psychology can have any immediate dramatic effect on these systems. But if we are not concerned with human contributions to human suffering, who else should be working on these problems?
The assassination of John Kennedy may have been a major mark on the bench of history. It is
possible that Kennedy's death marked the demise of liberal optimism for a century. The liberal expectation of the gradual triumph of human sanity and reason has had to yield to the fearful fact that good and humanistic forces may not ultimately overcome. While people in many parts of the world have believed for a long time that injustice and human exploitation are the inexorable laws of life, there has been cause for optimism in our democratic society that man might indeed be his brother's keeper. The death of the young hero sharpened our perceptions so that we are now more receptive to the naked reality of human exploita- tion and psychopathic manipulation of people by people. Harold Lasswell (1970) said at our Con- vention last year:
If the earlier promise was that knowledge would make men free, the contemporary reality seems to be that more men are manipulated without their consent for more purposes by more techniques by fewer men than at any time in history [p. 119].
Surely, the cynical manipulation of the masses by powerful elites is a subject worthy of psychological investigation. Which groups arc most "dangerous to others"? Our society locks up overt paranoids. But it pays honor and respect to the industrialist who builds automobiles that are death traps, who sprays our fruit with coal tar poisons, and who shows utter disregard for public good in a simple- minded search for profits and power. Why have clinical psychologists not been concerned with the motivations of the manipulators? When the Con- gress refuses to include farm workers under mini- mum wage and health-legislation, it dooms hundreds of thousands of children and adults to lives of hopeless poverty and disease. When giant chemical companies dump deadly poisons into our streams and lakes, psychology should be involved in apply- ing its knowledge to prevention of such destruction.
In brief, the relevance of both our curriculum and of our internship experience must be questioned if we are not to have our roles defined for us by the values and goals of psychiatry and of the prevailing economic philosophy.
But there is another serious problem as well. The truly crippling sources of cognitive dissonance in the professional psychologist, which may ulti- mately destroy the unity of psychology, are the fundamental differences between the scientist and the professional. A primary one involves self-
 criticism and mutual criticism. Science is open, and its knowledge is public. Any discrepancies in knowledge are debated openly. One of the hall- marks of science is its insistence on public dis- closure of findings. Graduate students in science are taught that research is not completed until the findings are made public. A freewheeling spirit of incisive mutual and self-criticism, replication, debate, and argument over procedures, findings, and interpretation of data, is ever-present. In sharp contrast, a profession must jealously guard its secrets! Historically, one of the hallmarks of a profession has been the privacy of its knowledge. Tf the knowledge of the professional, his techniques, and his skills are available to anyone, and could be performed by anyone, a profession would dis-
integrate. Secrecy and mystery are essential. Even a special technical language is a universal characteristic of the profession. Why were pre- scriptions written in Latin? Why does a profession develop its own jargon, its own secret language? Why are professions protected by strict licensing laws that actually proscribe certain of their activities to anyone but the qualified professional?
The first professionals, according to Veblen, were the priests who thousands of years ago guarded the Egyptian temples at night and took the opportunity to observe the transit of the stars in the heavens. They discovered that the flood of the Nile co- incided with the juxtaposition of certain stars. Im- mediately, they had powerful knowledge of great value to their society, and, like professionals ever since, they kept their knowledge secret, thus pre- serving the prestige of their profession, their credi- bility, and their godlike qualities. While profes-
sions exist to serve society, they must protect what they know, and they must always pretend to know more than they do in order to retain public confi- dence. In contrast, science abhors secrecy and does not tolerate faking or pretense.
One of the most serious problems for the scientist-professional psychologist (Boulder model) has been the requirement that he play the incom- patible game of science, and so subject his tech- niques, his theories, and his methods to open public, critical, scientific scrutiny. If other pro- fessions had to engage in the kind of self-criticism and mutual criticism that clinical psychologists are required to perform, they would be experiencing the same agony as we. Imagine the chaos if public
and open debate and criticism were the rule in medical office diagnosis, drug therapies, surgery, etc. Let me illustrate my point with one example-—• what could have been clinical psychology's most mysterious and powerful magic—the Rorschach. Here was a procedure that fulfilled most of the criteria establishing the power of an independent profession. The Rorschach belonged to psychol- ogy. It had enormous face validity and credibility, and it required long and arduous supervised train- ing before one could be expert in its mysteries and its mystique. Its powers were so great that all sorts of controls had to be placed around the preparation of those who would be using it. Twenty years ago, most of us believed in the art of the Rorschach. The public was fascinated by
the magic we owned. Other professions viewed our magic with respect. But along came the hard- nosed scientists, the measurement people, with their questions about reliability and validity, with their split-half techniques, and their demand for public demonstration of the value of our magic under strictly controlled conditions. As a consequence, the Rorschach is quietly disappearing from the professional psychology scene because of our pro- fessional sensitivity to the claims of science. Inter- estingly, the public still believes in the Rorschach. Similarly, the process of psychotherapy—a mysteri- ous alchemy of great power and public interest—has
been subjected to controlled studies, to long-term follow-up, to objective evaluation procedures, to the point where it has lost considerable credibility within psychology, although professional ingenuity in inventing new forms of psychotherapy has at least kept pace with the efforts of evaluators to catch up and expose it!
Another related source of conflict: The research methods available to clinical psychology are not as pure and powerful as those in experimental psy- chology. Inasmuch as the heroes of any profession are the scientists who supply it with its soundest, most valid knowledge, the weaker research methods of the clinician subject him to criticisms that only add to his inferiority feelings. Anthropologists tell us that there are still societies that are unaware of the relationship between sexual intercourse and pregnancy. Many of the relationships important to the clinical psychologist are of this sort, par- ticularly the relationship between childhood experi-
ences and adult behavioral disturbances. The

farther causes and effects are separated in time, or the more occasions where a possible cause is not followed by the possible effect, the more difficult is the relationship to unravel through research. The hundreds of years that elapsed before the discovery of the relationship between syphilis in early adult- hood and the development of general paralysis of the insane in middle age was due in part to the long separation in time between cause and effect. Further, many persons with syphilis apparently re- covered from their disease and never developed general paralysis. Also, many persons developed paralyses without developing the mental symptoms of paresis. It was so confusing! One widely held explanation of general paralysis linked it to frequent minor trauma to the central nervous system because it was so common in traveling salesmen who had to ride the hard seats of railway cars for thousands of miles each year, while the condition was remark- ably absent in clergymen who ordinarily stayed close to home and were not subject to such spine- jarring experiences!
Some of our current clinical hypotheses may sound as ludicrous in another hundred years. But T would argue that the truly significant relation- ships explaining most psychological disorders will still be discovered to be those between early trau- matic conditioning and subsequent adult instru- mental acts to avoid the effects of such early painful conditioning. Harry Harlow has given us a clear-cut paradigm from the animal laboratory, and Bruno Bettelheim has provided a rough clin- ical example with schizophrenic children. Much research in this area does not have the methodo- logical purity to satisfy the experimentalists. While both the scientists and the professionals are con- cerned with discovering regularities in nature, the scientist, particularly the experimentalist, can choose more powerful methods of demonstrating such regularities. Experiments that impose strict control on the operation of independent variables often lead quickly to the identification of signifi- cant relationships. The discovery of regularities in nature is accelerated in psychological labs where pure strains of laboratory animals are available, destruction of cortical tissue can be accomplished, and extreme conditions of stress, sensory depriva-
tion, infantile trauma, and similar drastic manipula- tions are scientifically acceptable and practical.
On the other hand, the professional, dealing with human lives, is thus restrained by humane and
ethical considerations that frequently prohibit such manipulation of experimental variables. The cli- nician, including the clinical psychologist, often must engage in life-history research rather than experimentation. Any student of research design knows the pitfalls and complexities of such meth- ods, particularly when causes and effects are sepa- rated by long periods of time. The discovery of significant relationships is difficult and uncertain. As a result, clinical psychologists are often the recipients of scornful criticism from experimental psychologists because of the flabbiness of their concepts, the looseness of their hypotheses, and the unreliability of their procedures. In a field that accords its highest status to its scientists, the pro- fessionals are again second-class and disadvantaged.
There are those scientists who would, if they could, impose a moratorium on professional activi- ties in psychology "until we know more about the causes of deviant behavior." Even in clinical re- search, the more "rigorous" approach (Spence's Type IV laws seeking relationships between organic substrata and behavior) has higher status than the investigation of Type II laws (relating early experi- ence and behavior), because the experimental or empirical operations are neater, more direct, and more acceptable.
Additional sources of friction and polarization emerging within psychology today involve questions about the appropriateness of lobbying and social action. Some of this activity is meant to improve the economic position of the clinician, as in the case of health insurance coverage. Other efforts are proposed to influence the public, through APA pronouncements, on a range of issues varying from abortion laws and sexism to Vietnam and popula- tion control. In general, most scientists in APA take the position that they should engage in politi- cal activities as citizens but rarely in the name of psychology. Professionals, on the other hand, have a long history of expressing opinions on issues having direct or indirect consequences for the pro- fession, often in the absence of thoroughgoing knowledge and consensus. Professionals are pre- pared to testify, to speak out, to pass resolutions, on matters that they regard as destructive to the human condition, or not in their own or the public interest. Professionals do indeed act more godlike, echoing another difference between science and pro- fession. The scientist wants to examine all of the evidence before he takes a stand in a controversy.
 away from committing himself prematurely. The professional, in contrast, is accustomed to making decisions on the basis of incomplete or even scanty evidence—he may be accustomed also to making judgments in life-and-death matters where he has only small odds that he is right. He acts in the best interests, he hopes, of the human condition in the absence of scientific certainty.
Among other professions, for example, social work has passed resolutions on a wide range of social, national, and international problems, and the American Medical Association has relinquished its tax-exempt status in order to participate actively in attempts at influencing legislation—in opposing programs like social security, medicare, health insurance, etc. The National Education Associa- tion lobbies actively for teachers' benefits. The sciences, on the other hand, are less inclined to speak out on social issues except where science itself is directly threatened. What is chemistry's position on abortion? What does mathematics have to say about pollution of the environment?
The Board of Directors further considered this matter at its midsummer meeting in 1969 in Boston and adopted a statement which said, among other things, that APA could take no official stand affirming or denying the validity of any scientific hypothesis.
The cumulative weight of these positions makes APA's response to social issues relatively limited and further polarizes the professionals. Thus, for example, the Association might work energetically to obtain an increase in training and research funds for psychology from federal agencies, or it might take an active role in arguing against the restriction of the use of psychological tests and research. It might prepare a position paper on the comprehen- sive community health centers program. But it would not take a stand on the conclusions of the Kerner Report, nor on the war in Southeast Asia. While it is likely that a majority of psychologists personally agree with the conclusions of the Kerner Report, and would oppose the war, these are not matters of particular and special relevance to the field of psychology in its scientific functions. Many

He is willing to permit any and all hypotheses a professional matters, and a limited range of ap- hearing, and he is used to postponing decisions on propriate activities in the general area of social their validity until more evidence is in. He shies problems.
The social sciences are less inhibited in these areas
than the natural sciences. The national social professionals feel otherwise and mutter about the
science societies most closely involved in the study of human behavior and social phenomena have had experience with disruptive tactics from their stu- dents and younger members who are impatient with the conservatism of the "Establishment." The anthropologists, sociologists, political scientists, and psychologists have had their meetings disrupted for two or three years. So have the social workers and psychiatrists. Such confrontation has led to posi- tion papers and resolutions on social issues. But there has been less of this sort of activism among the harder sciences.
Psychology has had to agonize for several years over policy questions involving public affairs. Should American psychology speak out on the war, on racism? The ad hoc Committee on Public Affairs, chaired by Leona Tyler (1969), wrestled with these issues and concluded that the Board of Directors should assume full responsibility in the area of public affairs. The Tyler Committee de- veloped some guidelines for decisions about ap- propriate action. Briefly, it suggested a wide range of possible association action for scientific matters, a somewhat restricted range of possible actions for
Establishment in psychology and seek to politicize APA, change its governance structure and its tax status.
The activist also may point to the statement in the Tyler Report (1969) which suggests that mobilization of APA to obtain governmental policy changes "would be made only rarely, in cases where the legislation or policy threatened the continued existence or progress of psychology as a field of knowledge [p. 3]." Is there not evidence, asks the activist, that war, racism, and population growth may indeed threaten the continuing exis- tence of our American society? Serious observers, such as John Gardner, warn that the nation is in real danger of disintegration. If the nation deterio- rates, psychology will be among the first whose existence is threatened. Tyrants and totalitarians are not normally supportive of free scientific re- search, and particularly of free inquiry into human problems. So it might be argued that we live in a time when the very existence of psychology is threatened because the existence of our democratic society is threatened and therefore that it is im- portant that psychology throw its resources into

What are the future paths open to clinical psychology?
The first, logically, is the perpetuation of the
scientist professional model, with little or no change
in the traditional pattern of training as it has been
developed since it was established at Boulder and fessional psychologists in the community for reaffirmed at every subsequent training conference.
Under this model, the production of PhDs in clin- ical psychology took a leap in the early 1950s so that by the end of the 1960s as many clinical psychology PhDs had been produced as PhDs in experimental, comparative, and physiological psychology com- bined. American universities continue to produce PhDs in clinical psychology numbering about one- third of the total production of doctorates. But it is precisely this model which has been the source of many of the problems that I have pointed to. I do not believe it will survive much longer. There will be attempts to strengthen the scientific aspects of the model—to develop "experimental psycho- pathology" programs—but these will not be likely lo attract the students now seeking training or to
part-time teaching and supervision. The Chicago Conference on Professional Training very strongly recommended that graduate programs in clinical psychology appoint experienced clinicians to the teaching faculty, and, further, that clinical skills should be rewarded in the same way as research publications and teaching. Theserecommendations [ailed to take into account the realities of graduate education—the manner in which points toward promotion and tenure of faculty are accumulated. A professional school, on the other hand, can reward clinical excellence without the approval of graduate school scholars from nonprofessional areas.
There is little question that separate professional schools of psychology will produce primarily doc- toral level clinicians. Psychology's recent history,
these may succeed for a time until the problems of faculty status of professional people and appro- priateness of practicum settings catch up.
A second road for clinical psychology would be the attempt to establish separate professional pro- grams or professional schools of psychology. This alternative has much to recommend it for reasons already examined, and would gain for psychology the benefits of independence from arts and sciences graduate departments and deans, and from un- sympathetic experimental traditionalists within our own field. Industrial psychology has already begun to move its graduate programs out of the arts and sciences faculty and into schools of business ad- ministration and schools of management. Separate professional schools of clinical psychology are being proposed energetically by the National Council on Graduate Education in Psychology. One such school is already being developed by the California
psychology could train far more people than can be accommodated in PhD programs where lan- guages, dissertations, and other requirements slow down the rate of production. Professional schools can recruit from the very large number of young people motivated toward service careers.
Still another advantage of the separate profes- sional school would be that it would draw on pro-
 its status needs, and the already established state legislative programs for licensing and certification all would require that the graduates of professional schools be people at the doctoral level. But pro- fessional schools could also produce psychological technical specialists at lesser degree levels, some- thing that graduate programs have not been able to do.
The biggest barrier to the establishment of sepa- rate professional schools is the enormous expense— including the expense of psychological centers. This may be a barrier so formidable as to be impassable.
A third path for clinical psychology is a new major alliance with another profession that already owns a professional school with the practicum- training facilities that professional psychology has so desperately lacked for so long. I have been saying for years that as a profession exists to pro- vide services to the surrounding society, such services must be provided in some sort of institu- tion or institutionalized setting owned by the pro- fession. Medicine and surgery have offices and hospitals, and social work has settlement houses and social agencies, and library science has libra- ries, and dentistry has private offices, and educa- tion has schools. In all of these professions, the neophyte, after receiving thorough preparation in the theory, private language, and secret knowledge of his discipline, is sent for apprenticeship to one of these captive institutions, where he learns the skills of the profession and where he is further shaped in his professional role by experienced members of the profession.
Psychology has never possessed such a captive practicum training facility. For a time I thought that psychological centers were the answer for pro- fessional psychology. But I failed to recognize that a graduate school in an arts and sciences faculty cannot or will not operate such a center. We have little experience in providing direct clin- ical services to the public, and we have no deans or administrators who understand the need for such services as part of the training of our young professionals. Nor do our scientific colleagues understand this need.
Ideally, such centers should properly be part of separate and independent professional schools of psychology. But in the interim, they could also belong to someone else. We could join forces with another profession and thereby move our training
out of the inhospitable environment of the gradu- ate school department.
The programs could be located in medical schools. While I find this idea distasteful for many of the reasons examined above, we must at least consider the possibility of moving clinical psychology programs into departments of medical psychology or psychiatry. Another similar pos- sibility would be for clinical psychology to form an alliance with schools of social work or with schools of education.
We could exchange the teaching of behavioral science courses increasingly demanded by these ser- vice professions for permission to use their inter- vention resources and practicum facilities for the preparation of our own professional students. We could teach personality theory, learning theory, psy- chopathology, and research methods to medical students, or social work students, or education stu- dents, and train our own doctoral students in hospitals, settlement houses, or schools now con- trolled by one of these professions.
Because I feel that we can never win equality in a struggle with psychiatry and medicine, I favor an alliance with social work or education. We might work out a much happier symbiotic arrange- ment with one or both of these fields, and we would gain the administrative structure and the practicum facilities for professional training of our own.
A fourth alternative would be to take the drastic step of abandoning clinical psychology as a sepa- rate field. This would be a logical response to the possibly insoluble problems of training clinical psychologists in graduate schools, and the equally difficult problems of establishing either separate pro- fessional schools or new alliances with old profes- sions. This last alternative would suggest that graduate departments return to their historic role of preparing scholars and scientists to do the basic research and the teaching of knowledge that will be applied by other professional fields. Learning theory, personality theory, measurement theory, etc., would be given away to existing nonpsychology professions. Psychology would become a basic science for the profession of nursing, education, social work, medicine, and perhaps for new pro- fessions such as child-care and social welfare. Students seeking service careers in psychology would be steered into other fields. This solution is probably the least palatable to existing clinical psychologists, and perhaps the most attractive to

many psychological scientists. In terms of cold reality, it may turn out to be the most probable solution.
As the hand of psychological science controls the intake valve on aspiring professionals coming into our graduate schools, and as the more prestigi- ous departments cut off,or drastically reduce, the size of the flow into their clinical programs, or as these programs are changed into "experimental psychopathology" programs, and as the new schools of psychology fail to flourish because of the thin economic soil in which they are planted, we may witness the gradual disappearance of clinical psychology.
In any event, clinical psychology is going to disappear from the marketplace for a period of years. We are producing about SOO PhDs a year in clinical psychology in the United States, and with half of this number now taking academic jobs or postdoctoral fellowships, the number of clinical psy- chologists available for clinical work in traditional settings is so small as to be inconsequential.
Still another factor adds to the probability that clinical psychologists will disappear from view. This is the impending shortage of academicians in psychology that will lure clinical PhDs into teaching.
The National Education Association reports that college professors are lost, through retirement, death, or for other reasons, at a rate of approxi- mately 5% a year. This means that the productive life of the college teacher, all factors considered, averages about 20 years. (The average age of receipt of the PhD in psychology is 30.)
But psychology has had a far smaller rate of loss. Among academic disciplines, psychology has been a relatively young field. Most present aca- demic psychologists entered the field of college teaching after World War II, and so college teachers of psychology are younger than college teachers of English, history, or physical education. In addi-
tion, psychology is increasingly popular as an undergraduate subject, and so we have added young faculty to teach it. In undergraduate enrollment,
we have moved from an obscure twentieth place before World War II to position Number 1 today. Psychology professors have been young and numer- ous. But now we are entering a new decade, 20 years past the time when psychology took its great leap forward. I predict that our replacement need for college professors will take a substantial leap very soon. While much has been written in the popular press about the glut of scientists in the academic world, this situation clearly does not ap- ply to psychology. Very soon we will witness a large-scale scramble for new psychology teachers as replacements for retirees. It will come first from
the four-year liberal arts colleges where, as a gen- eral rule, college faculty members are older than in the universities. The frequent suggestion that graduate departments cut back on the production of psychologists, is based on a misreading of what is going to happen in academic psychology.
In summary, clinical psychology, as we have known it during the past 25 years, is unlikely to continue unchanged. I have tried to suggest some of the forces I see operating in the field that will influence its future. My feeling is that we will see a growing cleavage between scientific and professional psychology, that there will be an expansion of clinical training somewhere outside the graduate department, probably in separate profes- sional schools. Finding the roles of scientist and of professional incompatible when existing within the same individual does not mean that scientists and professionals do not need each other. The two
groups must exist in a mutually rewarding and symbiotic relationship. I feel that both science and profession will benefit from the impending division, and psychology can truly move forward in both areas as a means of promoting human welfare.

HAT are the prospects for the science Wand profession of psychology during the present decade? What are some of the influences that will affect our Association, per- haps in ways we would not choose if we were able
to plan our own course?
First of all, what will be the size of APA by
that we will fulfill Boring's prophesy for the year 2050. Indeed, I do not believe we will reach the 40,000-44,000 estimate for 1970.
Psychology's growth curve may reach an asymp- tote fairly soon and perhaps even before we reach the 30,000 figure. If we assume that 6% of psy- chologists withdraw from the field each year, we would need 1,800 annual replacements just to main-
1970? There are many ways to estimate a profes-
sion's growth. Fifteen years ago, Dael Wolfle tain a membership of 30,000. A 6°/o figure was the
(1947) estimated that the total membership of the American Psychological Association would be 16,000 by 1960 and 40,000 by 1970 if growth continued in the straight line it had followed from 1920 to 1947. Boring (see Sanford, 19S1) plotted a curve four years later that led him to predict almost 18,000 psychologists in APA by 1960, almost 44,000 by 1970, and almost 59,000,000 psychologists in 2050! Our actual membership in 1960 was 18,215.
foresee how we can expand doctoral programs be- yond the projections noted below. Unless there is a large expansion in Master's level programs during this decade, and an active effort to recruit these graduates, it seems probable that APA will stabi- lize at about 30,000 members.
I have used several methods to predict the mem-
bership of APA in 1970, but all seem open to ques-
tion. Our growth curve has been decelerating, but
a great expansion of college enrolments and gradu- will not be likely to exceed 1,200. It is hard to
ate school applications is in prospect. These anti-
thetical trends cloud the crystal ball. One method
of estimating future trends is to divide the number
of PhD degrees in psychology year by year over
the past several years into the increment in APA
membership for the same year. This gives a ratio
which should show short-range stability as extrane-
ous factors, such as the postwar degree boom, have
decreased effect. The ratios of new PhDs to APA rive at what seems a fairly accurate estimate. We
membership increments has dropped rather steadily from year to year. There is a choice of using a larger number of years and an average higher than the current ratio, or a smaller number of recent years to be sure the decreasing ratio is taken into account. Using both these methods, with United States Office of Education estimates of doctorates in the 1960s (Conger &amp; Fullam, 1959), I have ar- rived at an anticipated APA membership in 1970 between 30,000 and 33,000.
Our APA membership increased two and a half times in the decade 1950 to 1960. As our growth curve is steadily decelerating it does not seem likely
have exact figures on the total output of doctorates in the United States in all fields during the 1950s and on the output of PhDs in psychology for the same period. For these past 10 years the number of PhDs in psychology was almost exactly 6^°/o of total doctorates earned in all fields. Using the United States Office of Education estimates of the number of doctor's degrees to be awarded in the 1960s, and assuming that 6|% will continue to rep- resent the proportion in psychology, we can make yearly estimates of our output. Adding these yearly estimates we arrive at a total of 9,200 PhDs to be awarded in psychology during the current
90
best estimate of the rate of annual loss of college faculty members that could be made by the Re- search Division of the National Education Associa- tion (1961, p. 53) after a broad survey of existing information. It includes death, retirement, illness and disability, change of occupation, etc. It is hard to argue that our rate of loss will be any slower than 6% because of our higher proportion of women and our relatively higher than average tendency to leave the field for administrative and managerial positions.
The PhD output of our graduate schools by 1970
What will be the output of our graduate psy- chology programs during the 1960s? We can ar-
 decade. Now let us see what demands there will be for these people.
How many new college and university faculty members in psychology will be required in the 1960s? Ten years ago, a fair number of aca- demic disciplines were able to boast that at least half of their new college teachers had the doctoral degree. Along with psychology, more than half of all new teachers in the biological sciences and the physical sciences had received the PhD. Now psy- chology is the only academic field still above the 50% level. There has been a sharp decrease in the educational qualifications of college teachers in most fields, but especially in mathematics, English, and foreign languages.
There has been a growing demand for new faculty members in psychology. In 195S, 144 new full- time psychology teachers were employed in our colleges and universities. By 1960 this number had increased to 250. In 1961 the figure jumped to 320. In 1965, using a prediction method de- scribed below, we can estimate a need for approxi- mately 800 new faculty members in psychology and this number will continue to increase somewhat year by year thereafter.
In the first year of this decade the increase in college and university enrolments was 230,000. Each year enrolment in our higher educational in- stitutions will gain a little more than it did the year before until by 1970 the increase over 1969 will be 300,000 students. By 1970 well over 6,000,000 college students will be jammed into our colleges and universities. The 1960 enrolment was about 3,500,000.
In estimating the number of full-time faculty needed in higher educational institutions, the Re- search Division of the National Educational Asso- ciation (1961) used 6% as their estimate of the annual number of new faculty members needed to replace present faculty members who die, retire, or leave teaching. But this does not cover the in- creased enrolments.
This enrolment problem is causing uncertainty in estimates of future need for college faculty mem- bers. What is the extent to which increased en- rolments will be permitted to stretch student- faculty ratios? In estimating future needs for faculty, the Research Division of the National Edu- cation Association has arbitrarily assumed that some faculty expansion would have to occur but that we could not keep up with enrolments; per-
haps we will hold the student-faculty ratios to about a 20% increase.
Using these National Education Association esti- mates we can predict a real demand for 7,500 new college and university faculty members in psychol- ogy in the 1960s.
How many nonacademic psychologists will we need in this decade? If we continue to use 6% as the rate of attrition due to death, retirement, and other causes, and if we assume that we will find further demand in the nonacademic fields of psy- chology in proportion to the increase in the United States population, we can predict a need for 8,000 to 10,000 psychologists in nonacademic positions during the current decade.
It will be obvious that we are not going to pro- duce as many PhDs as the number of psychologists estimated as our minimum requirements. But if only half the total of new teachers and nonacade- micians are PhDs, we will come out even.
From this supply we will have to furnish addi- tional people to the growing option of private prac- tice. Nearly all of these will be new (or used) PhDs.
Let us look for a moment at the forces affecting private practice, particularly in clinical psychology. Just as public support of clinical psychology has
resulted in a marked increase in the number of clinical psychologists available, it seems safe to pre- dict that the public's growing and obvious willing- ness to support with fees psychologists in private practice will result in a sizeable increase in the number of clinical psychologists electing to enter this field.
How many psychologists are now in full-time private practice? While there is no answer to this question for the country as a whole, we have a number of sources of data which allow us to make estimates. Recently I had a student count the number of individual psychologists who list them- selves in the Yellow Pages of telephone directories in our 10 largest cities. Some 650 psychologists are so listed.
E. Lowell Kelly's (1960) recent survey of Divi- sion 12 membership found that 17% of his respond- ents reported private practice as their primary work setting. If this percentage of his sample can be extrapolated to the Division 12 membership as a whole this would mean that more than 400 mem- bers of Division 12 are engaged in relatively full- time private practice. Division 12 represents only
PSYCHOLOGY IN THE SIXTIES 91
 92 AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGIST
about one-third of the clinical psychologists who belong to APA. Continuing the extrapolation we arrive at an estimate of some 1,200 APA members (6% of the total membership) as the number in full-time private practice in clinical psychology. This is a very shaky estimate, of course, based on an extrapolation from an extrapolation. But it is the best guess we can make without much better data, and it does not differ appreciably from the 5% figure usually cited by the APA Central Office.
What are some of the factors responsible for the present and anticipated future growth in the num- ber of psychologists entering private practice? One reason, of course, is simply the fact that there are more psychologists than there used to be, and there will be more from year to year for awhile.
Other factors are also important. Our United States population is becoming more and more ur- banized and the private practice of clinical psy- chology is an urban phenomenon. Indeed profes- sional activities of all sorts are concentrated in urban areas. Psychologists turn out to be even more urbanized than physicians. In our 10 most highly urbanized states live 38% of our population, 43% of all MDs, and 55% of all APA members.
The principal reason for the growth in private practice of clinical psychology probably will be found in the acute and growing shortage of other professionals available to meet mental health de- mands of our middle and upper classes, particularly the shortage of psychiatrists. Elsewhere (Albee, 1959) I have shown in detail the fact that psy- ciatry is falling behind. Certainly our output of psychiatrists cannot be much expanded because this medical specialty is competing with other highly rewarded medical specialties for recruits from the limited pool of medical school graduates. As there is no immediate prospect of any sizable increase in the output of our medical schools and as psychi- atry will continue to recruit something less than 9% of the approximately 7,200 new medical gradu- ates each year, psychiatry cannot keep up with our growing population and with the need for replace- ment of those who leave the field.
Similar prospective shortages can be cited for other mental health fields. For example, there is a continuing manpower shortage in professional so- cial work and among clergymen of most religious denominations. All of these shortages seem des- tined to be chronic and to operate as a vacuum into
which private practitioners of clinical psychology inevitably will move.
Because the shortage of psychiatrists is likely to have such far-reaching implications for psychology we should look more closely at what is happening in psychiatry. In 1950 there were some 1,400 psy- chiatric residents in training in United States men- tal hospitals. By the end of the decade this num- ber had doubled. This sounds like a very sizeable increase. But in 1950 only 10% of the residents in psychiatric training were graduates of foreign medi- cal schools. By the end of the decade more than 40% of this group were from abroad. Two-thirds of the total of residents in our state hospitals are foreign trained. Often the attitude of the hospitals has been that it is better to have someone than no one. Recently the American Medical Association has raised serious question about this attitude with the result that qualifying examinations have now
been set up for foreign physicians to measure their competence in medical knowledge and in English. After December 31, 1960, all foreign physicians have had to be certified by the Educational Coun- cil for Foreign Medical Graduates.
Despite the sizable number of foreign physicians in residency training in this country, some 11 states in 1960 had no one in training in psychiatry. Ten additional states had fewer than 10 psychiatrists in training. In 22 of our states the public mental hos- pitals had not a solitary resident in training in psy- chiatry (American Psychiatric Association &amp; Na- tional Association for Mental Health, 1959). What do these figures mean? The number of psychia- trists available to that part of our population living in rural states, and to those hospitalized in public mental hospitals, is desperately short.
Of those psychiatrists in residency training across the country only some 800 were reported to be in their third year of training. All this simply means that we are not getting enough well-trained psy- chiatrists to meet our growing mental health de- mands. It is unfortunate, but true, that the fu- ture development of psychology is more likely to be influenced by this shortage in psychiatry than by any other single factor (save perhaps the teach- ing machine).
The increase in demand for private practitioners may affect the incomes of all psychologists. Gal- braith (1958) has pointed out that those profes- sions having the option of private sale of services are in a much better economic position than those
 in which the private practice option does not exist. Economically speaking one is much better off to be a dentist or a prostitute than a librarian or a so- cial worker! Even during periods of increased de- mand for professional services, charges for privately supplied services are likely to go up rather than down. With long-time endemic inflation a charac- teristic of our society, those professions with a siz- able proportion of their members in private prac- tice can adjust much more readily than strictly salaried professions to the increased costs of living. And even those professionals not electing the option of private practice must be better paid by agencies
in order to be held.
We have evidence that this economic law is be-
ginning to operate in psychology. Kelly's (1961) survey of Division 12 indicated that the median of male Fellows was over $14,000 a year and of female Fellows over $10,000 a year. These incomes are higher than the median income of psychologists in the National Register of Scientific and Technical Personnel (mostly PhD) reported by Levine (1961) to be about $9,000 a year.
Recently I did a mail survey of the Cleveland Psychological Association's Division of Psycholo- gists in Private Practice. I asked members of the group to report to me anonymously their gross pro- fessional income, and the proportion of their time they spent in private practice. For those respond- ing (85% of the group) median income last year was $17,500. The half-time private practice group earned $19,000, the full-time group $14,500.
The point I am making here is that all psycholo- gists, wherever employed, will tend to enjoy con- tinued improvement in their income because of the willingness of society to pay for the services of ap- plied psychologists, including those in private clini- cal practice. As this option grows, all our incomes will grow. Likewise, as sizable numbers of psy- chologists come to earn $20,000 a year, our social image, our power, our influence, and our conserva- tism will increase!
One of the difficulties with manpower estimates is that so often they merely project present trends and present ratios into the future, taking into ac- count population growth, increasing urbanization, and similar obvious factors.
Often they fail to take into account significant events which turn out to have a marked influence on future needs for professional personnel. The dis- covery of an antibiotic all but eliminated an entire
specialty area in medicine and created a whole new science. The recommendations of a Conant can go far towards eliminating the small high school, but can sharply increase the demand for counselors.
Many people predict that the publication of the final report of the Joint Commission on Mental Ill- ness and Health (1961) may prove to be such a pivot point in the whole field of mental health.
What are some of the implications of the recom- mendations contained in the Joint Commission's final report as they affect psychology and other mental health professions?
Many of the recommendations concentrate on the needs for intensified support of research, augmented treatment facilities, stepped-up care of the mentally disordered in general, and revolutionary changes in our present approach to mentally disordered per- sons. Nearly every one of these recommendations requires that we first break through the barrier of limited educational resources for professional man- power. While there are few signs that we are ready to make this effort now, it seems possible that the report will prepare the ground for a change in the social climate and we may witness a major effort to produce the professionals that do not now exist to implement the recommendations.
What are some of the specific recommendations that could affect psychology?
One recommendation concerned psychiatric units in general hospitals. The report expressed the point of view that no community general hospital of more than 100 beds is complete without a psychiatric unit. The fact is that at present only about some 600 general hospitals have any facilities for the care of mental patients beyond emergency admis- sions. This means that there are some 4,000 gen- eral hospitals in the country without such units. If we assume that a psychiatric unit in a general hospital would require the services of at least a half-time psychiatrist, a social worker, and a half- time psychologist, we begin to get some flavor of the personnel demands that would result from at- tempts to realize this particular recommendation.
Another recommendation is concerned with com- munity mental health clinics. The Joint Commis- sion recommended the modest objective of one fully staffed full-time mental health clinic to each 50,000 of our population. This certainly does not seem like an excessive goal until we consider how many professional people would be required to staff the clinics to meet this goal. Using the most conserva-

live estimate of our 1965 population it would take an additional 2,200 psychiatrists, 2,500 psycholo- gists and 5,200 psychiatric social workers to bring us up to this ratio for the whole United States. But there is one further difficulty. Because of the large number of our professional people located in highly urbanized states, and because of the pres- ent severe shortage of professional people in rural states, a much larger number of professionals would be needed to bring all of the states up to this goal than to bring up the country's average as a whole. While it is almost senseless to cite such figures, it would take nearly half of the professionalmember- ship of APA, the American Psychiatric Association, and the National Association of Social Workers to bring all of our states up to this modest goal jor mental hygiene clinics alone. (Of course, this num- ber would be increased if we decided to bring each county up to this desired ratio.)
Several other recommendations of the Joint Com- mission also would require enormous increases in personnel for realization. The needs of chronic public hospitals, children's clinics, intensive treat- ment centers, and follow-up care, all covered in the recommendations, increase manpower needs almost beyond meaning.
At the head of the list of recommendations was the proposal that a much larger proportion of funds for mental health be invested in basic research as contrasted with applied research.
If we must choose among the recommendations or assign priorities, in view of both the manpower picture and pure logic I would underline the neces- sity of making the painful decision to concentrate on training research personnel rather than treat- ment personnel. But most winds seem to be blow- ing in the other direction!
John Gordon, who was co-author of one of the Joint Commission reports, said in another context a few years ago,
No mass disease of man has ever been adequately con- trolled by attempts to treat the affected individual. Some progress can be made, there are ethical reasons for that approach, but if the objective is control of the condition in the population the fundamental approach is through defi- nition of the nature and extent of the problem, the recog- nition of causative factors, and prevention. A program based on treatment of the exaggerated illness is temporiz- ing and with no great promise of productive results; it is good clinical medicine but poor public health (Gordon, 1956).
It is obvious that simply producing more profes- sional people prepared as therapists from our gradu- ate schools and professional schools does not guar- antee the realization of the objectives outlined in the Joint Commission's report. If large numbersof our newly trained professional people go into pri- vate practice with middle-aged neurotics in high- income suburbs, doubling our output will be rela- tively meaningless.
We are torn between a humanitarian desire to do something to help present day neurotics and psy- chotics and the rational decision that only by re- search can we achieve our goal of reducing suffer- ing. Attempts to solve the problem of mental dis- order through approaches based on one-to-one, face- to-face relationships, however moral and admirable, are simply not sensible from a manpower point of view.
Sensible or not, the growth in psychology con- tinues to be in the direction of application rather than basic research.
The very rapid increase in the number of stu- dents entering graduate work in psychology has been accompanied by a concurrent change in the flavor and content of our undergraduate curriculum, thus influencing the self-selection of future gradu- ate students.
The self-selection that had led undergraduatesin the past to major in psychology, and has thereby provided the pool from which graduate students have been recruited, has occurred through the screen of a relatively difficult undergraduate curriculum. There is evidence that this situation is changing. In many ways, in many places, the undergraduate program in psychology has sacrificed rigor and diffi- culty in favor of interest and humanism.
Recently I had a graduate student tally some of the content of five introductory textbooks in wide- spread use today and contrast their content with five texts used 25 years ago. Briefly we found that present day introductory psychology textbooks have more than five times as many references to such "interesting" topics as dreams, hypnosis, neuro- sis, psychosis, and psychotherapy, as the text- books of the 1930s. Our modern texts, despite their greater length, have doubled the proportion of pages devoted to personality, conflict, mental disorder, and adjustment. Twenty-five years ago only one text in five mentioned psychoses or psychotherapy. Today, nearly all of our introductory texts go into detail on these topics.
 Because our undergraduate majors are, in large measure, self-selected as a result of exposure to be- ginning courses, it seems probable that our future recruits will be of different interest patterns and motivations because of the changing appeal in our subject matter emphasis. This change in the in- terest pattern of future psychologists will undoubt- edly be reflected in changes in graduate programs in the direction of more emphasis on methods and techniques of diagnosis and therapy and decreased emphasis on research.
The increase in interest in diagnosis and therapy will lead to a change in the emphasis of job activi- ties of psychologists with further effects on our image. A very small proportion of the Division 12 clinical psychologists surveyed by Kelly reported a primary interest in research. Only one-tenth of them were occupied primarily in research and only one-fourth of the group reported any research ac- tivities. Seventy-five percent were not doing any research! Who will argue that this situation will not affect eventually the content and emphasis of
graduate education?
Nearly 40% of the clinical psychologists Kelly
surveyed thought the next generation of psycholo- gists should be trained in a special degree program combining parts of medicine, psychology, and social work! It is doubtful that this group would agree with the recommendations of the Miami conference emphasizing the primacy of research preparation.
Finally, we are likely to witness an increase in the presently growing interest in legislation, and public relations, and in such professional matters as malpractice insurance, tax deductibility of psy- chological therapy, and strengthened professional
organization. Where will it all end! Eventually we may hear our APA Executive Officer testifying before the Congress against every piece of legisla- tion that smacks of socialized psychology! We will engage in cocktail party defenses of the in- alienable right of every citizen to choose his own psychologist without government interference.

#### Interpersonal Dynamics in a Simulated Prison
##### Background

After he had spent four years in a Siberian prison the great Russian novelist Dostoevsky commented, surprisingly, that his time in prison had created in him a deep optimism about the ultimate future of mankind because, as he put it, if man could survive the horrors of prison life he must surely be a “creature who could withstand anything.” In the century which has passed since Dostoevsky’s imprisonment, little has changed to render the main thrust of his statement less relevant. Although we have passed through periods of enlightened humanitarian reform, in which physical conditions within prisons have improved somewhat and the rhetoric of rehabilitation has replaced the language of punitive incarceration., the social institution of prison has continued to fail. On purely pragmatic grounds, there is substantial evidence that prisons neither “rehabilitate” nor act as deterrent to future crime—in America, recidivism rates upwards of 75% speak quite decisively to these criteria. On humanitarian grounds as well prisons have failed: our mass media are increasingly filled with accounts of atrocities committed daily, man against man, in reaction to the penal system or in the name of it. The prison undeniably creates, almost to the point of cliché, an intense hatred and disrespect in most inmates for the authority and the established order ot society into which they will eventually return. And the toll which it takes on the deterioration of human spirit for those who must administer it, as well as for those upon whom it is inflicted is incalculable.

##### Rationale

Attempts to provide an explanation of the deplorable condition of our penal system and its dehumanizing effects upon prisoners and guards, often focus upon what might be called the dispositional hypothesis. While this explanation is rare expressed explicitly, it is central to a prevalent non-conscious ideology: that the state of the social institution of the prison is due to the “nature” of the people who administer it, or the “nature” of the people who populate it, or both. That is, a major contributing cause to despicable conditions, violence, brutality, dehumanization and degradation existing with any prison can be traced to some innate or acquired characteristic of the correctional and inmate population.

The dispositional hypothesis has been embraced by the proponents of the prison status quo (blaming conditions on the evil in the prisoners), as well as by its critics (attributing the evil to guards and staff with their evil motives and deficient personality structures).  A critical evaluation of the dispositional hypothesis cannot be made directly through observation in existing prison settings, since such naturalistic observation necessarily confounds the acute effects of the environment with the chronic characteristics of the inmate and guard populations. TO separate the effects of the prison environment per se from those attributable to a priori dispositions of its inhabitants requires a research strategy in which a “new” prison is constructed, comparable in its fundamental social-psychological milieu to existing prison systems, bt entirely populated by individuals whoa re undifferentiated in all essential dimensions form the rest of society.

##### Experimental Design
Interpersonal dynamics in a prison environment are to be studied experimentally by designing a functional simulation of a prison in which subjects role-pay prisoners and guards for an extended period of time. To assess the power of the social forces on the emergent behavior in this situation, alternative explanations in terms of pre-existing dispositions are to be eliminated through subject selection. A homogeneous, “normal” sample is to be chosen after extensive interviewing and diagnostic testing of a large group of volunteer male college students. Half of the subjects are to be randomly assigned to role-play prison guards for eight hours each day, while the others role-play prisoners incarcerated for nearly one fill week. Neither group will receive any specific training in these roles. The primary investigator will role-play the prison warden, and consultants from the real prison population (both prisoners and prison officials) will be recruited to assist in the planning and implementation of the prison environment.

Continuous, direct observation of behavioral interactions will be supplemented by video-taped recording, questionnaires, self-report scales and interviews. All these data sources are likely to converge on the conclusion that this simulated prison will develop into a psychologically compelling prison environment.

##### Significance and Contributions

The authors believe that this demonstration will reveal new dimensions in the social psychology of imprisonment worth pursuing in future research, In addition, this research will provide a paradigm and information base for studying alternatives to existing guard training, as well as for questioning the basic operating principles o which penal institutions rest. There is great need today for prison reforms that recognize the dignity and humanity of both prisoners and guards whoa re constantly forced into one of the most intimate and potentially deadly encounters known to man. This study has the potential to inform those reforms.

This activity provides a visual demonstration of the well-known limitation on information processing capacity represented by the C. A. Miller's phrase "the magical number seven, plus or minus two." Students are Presented with an. arrays of dots, arranged either randomly or in patterns. A graph of students' iudgments of the number of dots in each array demonstrates the limits of information pro- cessing capacity and the facilitative effect of chunking. The demonstration also provides opportunities to explore aspects of experimental design and descriptive statistics.
CoNcrpr
The phrase "magical number seven/ plus or minus two" refers to the limited capacity of short-term memory {Miller, 1956). This activity, unlike the auditory demonstrations typically included in introductory texts/ uses visual stimuli to demonstrate this capacity and the value of chunking. It easily can be extended to cover erperimental design and descriptive statistics.
In addition to chalk and a chalkboard, you will need 17 stimulus items, each c-onstructed from a sheet of Stlz-by-Ll in. whitb paper and black or blue coiored adhesive dots approximately 3fo in. in diameter. These dots are available in office supply stores. A total of 136 dots are needed.
Prepare the 17 stimulus items as indicated in appendix A. Each must consist of one sheet of paper with the number of dots indicated distributed either ran- domly or in a pattern. On the back of each sheet note lightly, for your own ref- erence, the stimulus item number as well as the number and distribution of the dots. This will enable you to check that the sheets are in the proper sequence before beginning the demonstration. -
The construction of stimulus items as described here has proved adequate for classes of up to 90 students. For larger classes, you may want to construct the stimulus items by placing adhesive dots directly on overhead transparency sheets. These, however, are more difficult to handle. If you use this method, check in advance to make sure all the dots on each transparency actually project on the screen.
You may also want to prepare a summary sheet that indicates the random stimulus item numbers in order of increasing number of dots (stimulus items 6, 3, 12, I, 16, 14,9, LL,5,4, 17,2,8, and 13) and the patterned item numbers in

 the same order (stimulus items 15, 7, and 10). This will facilitate the construction of the results gaph.
lNsrnucnoNs Preparation
RrconorNc Rrsulrs
On a table in front of you, arrange the stimulus items face down from Item I (on top) through Item 17 {on the bottom). Ask the class to turn to a blank page in their notebooks and number from line I through line 17.
Say to the class: "I am going to show you some sheets of paper with dots on them. For each sheet, I wili give you three beats to get ready, one beat to watch, and one beat to write down the number of dots you see on that sheet. Write your answer for each sheet on a drfferent line, going from Line 1 through tine iZ. t will not be calling out line numbers, so just keep going until we finish. For each sheet, I wiil say, 'dah, dah, dah, look, write."' Demonstrate with hand motions how you will hold up a stimulus item on "look."
Strmu/us Prcsentation
Show each sheet by countin&amp; at approximately I sec per beat, "dah, dah, dah, look, write." As you say "look," hold up a stimulus item. As you say "write," put the sheet face down. Repeat for each stimulus item.
Draw a graph on the chalkboard. Label the verticai axis "Number of Persons Correct" and mark it in units of 10. Label the horizontal axis "Number of Dots" and number it from I to 14 (the maximum number of dots).
Referring to your summary sheet listing all the stimulus items, go through each item in the order of increasing dots and ask for a show of hands as to the number of students who wrote down the correct number. For examplet sayt "sheet 6 had one dot. How many of you were correct?" Follow this with, "Sheet 12, two dots," and so on. It is helpful to know in advance how many are actually present so you can subtract the number of people wrong when almost everyone is correct. With a large class, divide the class into sections and have someone count each section.
Using this procedure, record the number of persons correctly responding to random arrangements of 1 through 14 dots. For each stimulus item, count the number of correct persons and plot a solid dot at the appropriate place on the graph. Connect the solid dots with solid lines to complete the graph. Then record the number of persons correctly responding to the three items with dots aranged in patterns. Indicate the number correct with small hollow circles and connect these with broken lines. Complete your graph with a key indicating that solid circles connected by a solid line correspond to random arrangements, whereas hollow circles connected with a broken line indicate pattern arrangements.
Typicaily, for random arrangements of dots, virtually the entire class is correct for I through 5 dots. Thereafter, the number of persons correct begins to decline, and does so precipitously for 10 through 14 dots. Your graph will not be perfect, but the trend should be clearly apparent.
Once you have constructed the graph for random arrangements, ask the class to interpret the graph. Identify the point where lots of people begin to make

mistakes and relate this to the "magical number seven,,, which represents our information-processing capacity.
When dots are arranged in patterns, the number correct is always higher. Ask
the-class to compare the number correct for 9, lO, and 12 dots arranged in patterns
with the number correct for 9, 10, and 12 dots distributed randomly..4sk for
suggestions as to why the results are as they are. Introduce the conceprof chunk-
ing to explain the dramatic increase in capacity when information is organized into patterns.
AJter discussing the main findings of the demonstration, you can extend the
activity by having students analyze it in terms of experimental design. Have them
identify the independent variables (there are two: the total numblr of dots and
the type of arrangement/ random or pattern) and the dependent variable (number
of persons correct) for the demonstration. Ask for someone to state a relationship
between the independent and dependent variables that was illustrated by this
activity. (As the number of dots increased the number of persons corrett de-
creased. However, the number of persons correct was higher when the dots were in a pattern.)
Continuing your discussion of variables, ask the class to identify possible uncontrolled variables that might have affected the outcome. These mlglt lnctude such things as distance from the stimulus items, viewing angle, m&amp;ement of stimulus items as you held them up, inadvertent variations in viewing time, and so forth. Ask for suggestions as to how to adequately control for these variables, and describe laboratory instruments, such as the tachistoscope, that have been designed to enable increased control over such variables.
Finally, it is good to point out how avery large number of individual responses (roughly 17 times the number of people who participated) can be summarized by means of a single graph. This illustrates the value of graphs and other forms of statistics for making dara manageable and understandable.
Several writing exercises can be assigned to assess students, understanding of
information-processing capacity as illustrated by this activity. For example, -ask
the students to wdte a paragraph summarizing the purpose of the demonstration
and describing the independent variable, the dependent variable, and the relation- ship between them.
As a follow-up to the classroom discussion of uncontrolled. variables, you can also have students choose one of these variables and design an experiment in which it becomes an independent variable while other variables are controlled. Have students explain in writing how results could be summarized in a graph.
Finally, have students write descriptions of situations in which chunt&lt;ing ot
visual information into patterns is important. These might include occupat;ns
{e.g., air traffic controller or musician), sports (e.g., football or basketballi board
games (e.g., chess), and activities of daily iife (e.g., finding one,s car in a large
parking lot or ftnding items during a trip to a supermarket). In each instance, have
students indicate why they believe chunking is of value. Some examples of studies
reporting visual chunking are noted in the Reference and Suggested Reading sec- tions.

            <Text> CONCEPTUAL MODELS AND MANPOWER REQUIREMENTS IN PSYCHOLOGY
GEORGE W. ALBEE
Case Western Reserve University
IT is increasingly clear that the current and the prospective professional manpower shortages in the mental health field derive primarily from a set of interacting considerations that go somewhat as follows:
Disturbed and disturbing human behavior cur- rently is "explained" by a conceptual model which attributes causation to "disease" or to some form of "illness." The content of the explanatory model accounting for these sorts of human deviation dic- tates the specific kind of institutional structure which society must support for the delivery of care or intervention. And the nature of the institu- tion in turn dictates the kind of manpower required for its staffing. So we are confronted with a desperate shortage of medical and paramedical pro- fessionals required to staff hospitals, clinics, and centers. This shortage is going to worsen in the
years ahead as the institutional demands proliferate while the manpower supply does not.
Because of the primacy of the disease explanation for disturbed behavior, the largest share of available funds for training and for research is funneled into biomedical programs. These training programs are producing professionals who, after being trained at public expense, do not work primarily with these serious, chronically disturbed people who are the responsibility of tax-supported institutions (Arn- hoff &amp; Shriver, 1967). And, further, the biomedi- cally oriented research programs demanded by the disease model support complex laboratory research studies that have little relevance to the real etio- logical problems of disturbed people.
There is a current, popular platitude which says that the social and behavioral sciences seriously lag the physical and biological sciences in knowl- edge. If only, it is opined, we could make faster progress in behavioral science, if only we could learn as much about the human being as we know already about germs and atoms, then more effec- tive programs could be developed to deal with man's problems with himself and with his fellows.
This reading of the knowledge situation is far from accurate. We do know a great deal in the behavioral sciences, but many of the things we know are threatening to the mental health Establishment and therefore to the status quo. For example, we know very well that the nature of the social world of the infant and child in the family are of primary importance as determinants of subsequent rates of disturbed behavior. Tn our Western culture the stable family is the best bulwark against later be- havioral and emotional disturbance. Efforts at pre- vention of mental disorder should be directed to those social institutions that affect family stability directly or indirectly, positively or negatively. For hopelessly disrupted families we should seek new ways of providing the best possible alterna- tives for the children affected—whether in foster
homes or specially designed institutions like kibbut- zim.
When eventually alternative explanatory models for disturbed behavior are widely tolerated, and institutions based on them supported with public funds are available, there will still be real mental illness to keep busy the organically oriented psy- chiatrist. All of the emotional problems associated with serious central nervous system malfunctioning, seizure states, toxic and endocrinologically induced psychoses, and the problems of organically induced behavioral disturbances in general will be left. But of course these are not the conditions that in- terest contemporary psychiatry, perhaps in part because there is so little token reinforcement with these kinds of cases! Psychotherapy is the pri- mary professional activity in psychiatry, and mild neurotics are the preferred cases.
The mental health establishment has made so many promises to so many groups in our society that it is beyond the wildest manpower dream thai it can begin to supply these services (Albee, 1967). Let me just mention some of these new demands without elaborating them.
The labor unions, particularly the United Auto
 318
AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGIST
Workers, have negotiated contracts for outpatient psychiatric care for their members and families— more than two and a half million UAW people sud- denly have become eligible for outpatient mental health care. Other unions actively are establishing their own mental health clinics. Once one union docs these things other unions must begin to do them too, and all of these new plans require scarce professional manpower.
Perhaps the single most important recent legisla- tive act in this whole field, so far as manpower de- mand is concerned, was Medicare. Without going through all of the different components of Medi- care, it can be said for sure that an enormous new group of users of mental health services suddenly is eligible for prepaid or insured care. One of the most important parts of Medicare is Title 19, under which anyone defined as "medically indigent," along with their children, is eligible for outpatient psy- chiatric care and other mental health services. There will be very large new demands for profes- sional mental health care under this law.
Nor need we dwell long on the 2,000 new com- prehensive mental health centers that the National Institute of Mental Health promises will be built by 1980 with Federal, state, and local funds. The demand for professional medical and paramedical care in these centers is beyond all hope of realiza- tion. How can the 2,000 centers be staffed when two-thirds of our existing 2,000 psychiatric clinics are without a single full-time psychiatrist, and when little psychiatric care is available in at least one- third of our state hospitals (National Committee against Mental Illness, 1966)?
There is no point in discussing the Appalachian program, although it contains more extensive blue- prints for programs in mental health than the whole Comprehensive Community Mental Health Centers Act!
Nor need there be further elaboration on current manpower shortages in all the other professions represented in the 2,000 existing "psychiatric" clinics, the VA hospitals, the state hospitals, in higher education, etc. The point I hope to leave with you in this recitation of the growing demand for mental health services is this: All of the plans for increasing professional services for the aged, for the union members and their families, for the medically indigent, for the inner-city poor, and for all the others lining up for care—all of these pro- grams arc going to fail because we do not have
enough of the kind of manpower demanded by the disease model of mental disorder.
It is so simple. The explanatory model dictates the kind of professional manpower needed to staff the institutions. This means a current and future need for nonexistent medical and paramedical pro- fessionals. Since 1958, when the Bane report was made to the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare (Bane, 1959), it has been the consensus of all manpower experts that we should be producing at least 11,000 physicians a year in this country, if we are only to stay even in the ratio of physicians to population! But we are not training this num- ber. Currently we are training only 7,500 annually —so, year after year, we fall at least 3,500 new MDs farther behind the number that would be required just to keep our ratio of physicians to population constant. The only possible conclusion is that physicians, and, as a consequence, psychi- atrists, are going to be in even shorter supply, while all of these service demands I sketched a moment ago are mushrooming everywhere.
Elsewhere I have argued that the future avail- able supply of clinical psychologists and social workers is at least as inadequate as the prospective supply in psychiatry (Albee, 1967). The demands for academicians in psychology, for example, can absorb most of the PhDs we produce over the next decade or two. Because psychology is a relatively young profession there has not been a large re- placement demand for faculty members in this field. In other academic fields this replacement figure approaches 6% a year. As psychology pro- fessors continue to age we will need to hire replace- ments in addition to those needed for the expand- ing student enrollments.
Any manpower planning for mental health care as now conceived must confront explicitly these prospective chronic shortages of professionals. If we continue to use the illness model of mental dis- order, we cannot produce a fraction of the medical and paramedical people the model demands. This would not be a sufficient reason for abandoning the illness model, if it were supported firmly by research evidence. But the evidence supporting it is thin indeed. What I am suggesting is that we are in a manpower cul-de-sac because of the con- ceptual model we use. The development of alterna- tive models could lead to new manpower solutions because they would allow for new institutional solu-
 CONCEPTUAL MODELS AND MANPOWER REQUIREMENTS 319
tions requiring manpower more easily recruited and trained.
Eventually the demands of society will prevail. The times are ripe for new models, for new ideas. We cannot push along this social change unless we develop a new set of concepts, a new conceptual armamentarium, a new language, a new delivery system for service.
This reconceptualization must follow rejection by psychology of the illness model. But it is not simply a matter of blowing a trumpet and seeing the walls collapse! The illness model is sup- ported by powerful forces. There are many rea- sons for its persistence in the field of functional behavior disorder (Albee, 1967).
The model was developed, and it has persisted, because it was more convincing than the sin, taint, or demonic explanations. Also, the early success in finding the spirochete to be the cause of paresis led to hopes that other mental "illnesses" also had similar causes. Further, it seemed more and more as though genetic factors were important. The illness explanation also supported the practice of putting victims out of sight in plague houses until "a cure" was found. Money could be spent on chemical and biological research, without upsetting the value hierarchy in the society. Finally, both family and society could avoid personal responsi- bility for mental disorder. They could blame Fate.
Perhaps, however, the most compelling reason of all for the persistence of this model has been the absence of any alternative model. A scientific model will persist until a more valid and more convincing model appears.
Over the past 20 years there have begun to emerge out of psychotherapy, experimental work in the learning laboratory, cultural anthropology, and social work, to name just a few sources, elements of an explanatory model for disturbed behavior which might be called the social learning theory. This theory argues that most disturbed behavior con- sists of learned operant anxiety-avoiding responses. The origins of the anxiety to be avoided are to be found in traumatic social interaction of infants and children with the parents or parent surrogates. Evidence to support this explanatory model is ac- cumulating in the research literature.
I suggest that as psychologists we have played the illness game for 20 years and this is long enough. The rules of the illness game are such that there will never be enough professional people avail-
able to provide care except to selected members of the middle and upper classes. As long as the ill- ness model occupies the center of the stage, all of the planning, all of the action is going to deal with psychiatric treatment, mental hospital beds, and the Team. Psychology must create its own in- stitutional structure for developing methods for the delivery of service, because only in its own struc- ture can it begin to elaborate this new conceptual model—the dimensions of which I have sketched so briefly—together with the language and the in- tervention methods that eventually will permit peo- ple with a bachelor's degree (or even less educa- tion) to be the line workers in the field of behavioral disorders.
Let me emphasize that I do not see psychology as the care-delivery field. We can never have the manpower to meet the demands. Rather, we must create the theory and show how it is ap- plicable, to enable care to be given by bachelor's level people in habilitation centers that they them- selves administer. Psychology can only be the developer of the conceptual models and of the research underpinning. The parallel with the field of education is evident. Intervention in the educa- tional system is by bachelor's level teachers who are supported by more highly trained research workers from several fields. Only when institutions are built in which BA people can work with dis- turbed or retarded children and adults (perhaps Project Re-ed is the best example of what ] have in mind) will we begin to meet the demand.
Frankly, I find it astonishing that all of us as parents, and as citizens, are willing to send our children to the daily ministrations of school teach- ers trained essentially at the bachelor's level, and yet we insist that professionals dealing with our emotionally disturbed and mentally retarded chil- dren and adults must have far more training than teachers for their face-to-face intervention.
Let us start developing an institutional structure where the rules and language are based on research findings in behavior modification. Let us develop centers where technicians, nonprofessionals, re- habilitation workers of all kinds can be used to maximize human potential. Until we have a con- ceptual assessment system that uses indications of strength we will still be playing the illness game. The new model which I think we must develop will stress the maximization of human effectiveness. I have argued that this model will not be built until
 320 AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGIST
psychology develops it in its own service delivery setting from which we can also go out into those community agencies where the real problems are.
Once society accepts the position that most, if not all, functionally disturbed behavior represents learned patterns of anxiety avoidance, the institu- tions developed to deal with these conditions may well be educational in nature.
Albert Bandura (1967) has said it well:
The day may not be far off when psychological disorders will be treated not in hospitals or mental hygiene clinics but in comprehensive "learning centers," when clients will be considered not patients suffering from hidden psychic pathologies but responsible people who participate actively in developing their own potentialities [p. 861.
Unless psychology assumes leadership in develop- ing alternatives to the illness model, the mental health manpower picture is going to continue to get worse. We cannot train enough medical and paramedical professionals to meet the manpower needs of hospitals and clinics, but, more important,
we cannot use knowledge already available to deal with the pressing problems of our urbanized, au- tomated antihuman existence.

Discussion
Cut out approximately 40 pieces of paper 2 inches x 2 inches. Then cut these 2-inch squares into a variet5r of shapes. TWenty of the pieces should have only straight edges, and 20 pieces should have at least one curved side each. (Save them in an envelope for repeated use.) Mix up the paper shapes and spread them out on a desk or table top. Ask for a student volunteer. Tell the volunteer to start picking up the pieces of paper one at a time and place them in a box. Each time the student picks one of the pieces that has a curye on it, say "Yes, that is correct." Each time the student picks up a completely straight-edged piece, give no reinforcement at all. Usually within 10 to 15 draws, the student will "learn" what has been defined as the "correct response" and will swiftly continue picking up pieces until all of the curved pieces are gone. (The students observing usually begin to approvingly glggle as the volunteer receives rapid positive reinforcements.)
Ask the student to tell the class what she or he has learned. Be sure to point out to the class thatthe only input given the student (aside frorn the initial direction to pick up pieces) was in the form of Positive Reinforcement. Nothing was said about shapes or any other facet of the task. Ask t.I:e student to relate to the class what went through his or her mind during the leaming process. Various trial-and-error strategies often emerge here (e.g., "At first I thought it was the larger pieces that were correct because t}le first big one I picked up was correct.") The basic operant-conditioning diagram provided here is helpful in summarizing for the class what they have just witnessed.

In reality there are two distinct associations named 'APA.' The American Psychiatric Association, which is composed of Medical Doctors who practice Psychiatry, maintains the DSM. The American Psychological Association, which is composed of academics (PhDs) who study the mind in a variety of ways, does not.  In this game, we have conflated these two distinct associations. If you are interested in studying these events in closer detail, most characters with MDs are members of the American Psychiatric Association, while characters with PhDs are members of the American Psychological Association. For the most part, events with which a character interacts occurred under the umbrella of their respective organizations.

Biography
Judah (Judd) Marmor, M.D. (1910-2003) was an important Los Angeles psychiatrist and psychoanalyst, acknowledged for his leadership role in the movement to declassify homosexuality as a mental disease, which was removed from DSM-II in 1973.
Born on May 1, 1910 in London, England, Dr. Marmor grew up in Chicago and New York. He attended Columbia College as a Pulitzer scholar and graduated from the Columbia College of Physicians and Surgeons in 1933. Afterwards he began his postgraduate training in neurology and psychiatry and went into private psychiatric practice. Dr. Marmor began his psychoanalytic training four years later at the New York Psychoanalytic Institute in 1937.
After serving as a Senior Attending Surgeon (Lt.) in the Navy during WWII, Dr. Marmor and his wife Katherine moved to Los Angeles where he began as the Senior Attending Psychiatrist at Cedars of Lebanon Hospital in 1947. At this time he began visiting professorships in psychology and social welfare at the University of Southern California (USC) and the University of California, Los Angles (UCLA). In 1952, Dr. Marmor was appointed Clinical Professor of Psychiatry at the UCLA School of Medicine and a year later began as a Training Analyst for the Southern California Psychoanalytic Institute. In 1965 Dr. Marmor assumed the position of Director of the Division of Psychiatry at

 Cedars-Sinai Medical Center and in 1972 became the first Franz Alexander Professor of Psychiatry Chair at the USC School of Medicine.
Dr. Marmor rose to prominence early in his career in academic and professional psychiatric and psychoanalytic communities; he was known as a talented educator, prolific writer and a compassionate clinician. He was respected for his analytic work with Hollywood celebrities, his strong commitment to the civil and women's rights movements, and was also known to the public as Abigail Van Buren's mental health expert in "Dear Abby" advice columns.
Judd Marmor was also a leading figure in the movement to declassify homosexuality as a mental disease. Dr. Marmor worked for many years with homosexual patients beginning in the 1940s, and his first book Sexual Inversion and early publications regarding the subject were some of the first to feature biopsychosocial approaches to the issue of homosexuality. In 1967, Evelyn Hooker, chairwoman of the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) Task Force on Homosexuality, nominated Judd to be a member. The NIMH Task Force produced an influential final report two years later, the recommendations of which would have far-reaching effects for social policy, training, treatment, and government funded research.
From 1970 to 1973 annual APA conferences were disrupted by protests from gay activists. Shortly after Dr. John Fryer's now famous "Dr. H. Anonymous" presentation at the annual APA conference in Dallas in May of 1972, the Nomenclature Committee, Dr. Marmor then the Vice President and Dr. John P. Spiegel the President-elect of the APA met with gay activist groups to discuss the category of homosexuality as it appeared in the Diagnostics and Statistics Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM). In 1973, a DSM-II development committee led by Dr. Robert Spitzer put forth a vote to the APA Board of Trustees, and a year later the APA membership would vote to remove homosexuality from the DSM-II. Dr. Marmor had long been an outspoken critic of classifying homosexuality as a mental illness and was influential in many historic events that ended discrimination against homosexuals in the psychiatric community.
Dr. Marmor sat on numerous journal editorial boards and boards of directors, and was the president and/or vice-president of six professional medical organizations and societies; including the American Academy of Psychoanalysis, American Psychiatric Association, Group for the Advancement of Psychiatry, Southern California Psychoanalytic Institute, and Southern California Psychoanalytic Society.

ln this activity, the class receives a handout describing the demographic characteristics and brief Iife history of a woman named Doris, along with a dleam she reported having. At the bottom of the handout, there is space for the student to interpret the me_aning of Doris's dream. The dream is the same on each handout, but the description of Doris is not.

This activity is designed to help students understand that the interpretation of dreams, like the interpretation of other stimuli, can be influenced by prior knowl- edge, expectancies, motivation, emotion, and other top down processes. More spe- cificaliy, it illustrates how easily a clinician's prior knowledge-about a client might prompt very different conclusions about the meaning of dream content.
This activity provides an easy way to show students the link between prin- ciples that guide the perception of objects and those that operate in social per- ception in general and in psychotherapy in particular.
You will need copies of each of the three handouts given in appendixes A, B, and C. Collate the three items before you hand them out, so that one third of the students will receive each version.
To aid class discussion of varying dream interpretations, it is helpful to have each version of Doris's demographics and life history on overhead transparencies in print large enough to be read from the back of the room.
Give each student a version of the Doris handout. After a few minutes, ask the students to write their interpretation of the dream at the bottom-and perhaps the back-of the handout. You can either collect and read aloud some of the interpretations, or just ask students to read them aloud.
As the readings proceed, it will soon become obvious to the class that something is amiss. At this point, reveal the differences in the three descriptions of Doris and point out the influence those differences had on the interpretations of Doris's dream.
You can end this demonstration by pointing out that clinicians are aware of the role of prior knowledge in dream analysis (and other aspects of therapy). This is why, for example, they tend to base conclusions about clients on a series of dreams rather than on just one and why they seek to combine assessment infor- mation from various sources, such as tests and interviews. I have found that stim- ulating class discussions result {rom pointing out that, in spite of such efforts, clinicians are as vulnerable as the rest of us to the biasing effects of expectancy in dealing with clients.

In addition to having students write their interpretation of the dream in class, you might also ask students to write a summary of the puq)ose of the demon- stration and what they learned from it. This can be done in 5 min at ttre end of the exercise or at the end of class. A quick perusal of the summaries can show if students understood the point that you were trying to make. Summaries are ef- ficient ways to check for student understanding.

If the gamemaster wishes to make a point about the influence of psychopharmacology and health insurance companies in the development of the DSM-III, he or she may wish to make use of the 'Exhibits' included in the “Call for papers and symposia” and hang up posters advertising Miltown,   Tofranil, Librium and Valium. There are a great number of blogs and websites dedicated to storing and distributing these historical images. Here are a few:

	* Miltown: http://www.homemakerblush.com/miltown-a-piece-of-1950s-homemaker-history/
	* Tofranil: http://adpharm.net/blog/?s=tofranil
*Librium: http://www.mmm-online.com/med-ad-hall-of-fame-to-induct-lerner-girgenti-and-rubin/article/155796/
* Valium (1965): http://www.entropy.in/valium-launch-advertisement/ 
*Valium: http://faculty.weber.edu/ewalker/Medicinal_Chemistry/topics/Psycho/psycho.htm (look for 'Valium Ads', there are three links).

At the same time,  we should remember that Medicare and Medicade were created in 1965, and the health insurance industry was being rev.utionized at this time.

 	##### Proposals to be brought before the Board
	Ad hoc committees: 

	*history of treatment of homosexuality (proposed by Marmor, 1971)
	*taskforce on sexual deviation (proposed by Socarides, 1971)
	*Spitzer task force, dissolution of nomenclature committee (Spitzer, 1973)

	*Removal of homosexuality (Marmor '71) (sent to nomenclature)
	*Removal of homosexuality immediately (Spitzer '73)
	*Creation of the Society for the Psychology of Women (Anastasi, 1973)
	*Creation of the committee on Women in Psychology (Anastasi, 1973)
	*Leona Tyler Principle (L Tyler, when president):
&gt; As citizens, members of the APA have the right to advocate for any cause through the myriad of political advocacy organizations, but when psychologists and psychiatrists speak for the profession through APA public stances and proclamations, it should be from science and professional experience. 
&gt; On occasion psychiatrists are asked for an opinion about an individual who is in the light of public attention or who has disclosed information about himself/herself through public media. In such circumstances, a psychiatrist may share with the public his or her expertise about psychiatric issues in general. However, it is unethical for a psychiatrist to offer a professional opinion unless he or she has conducted an examination and has been granted proper authorization for such a statement.
	*Hospital Privileges for Psychologists &gt;POSITION STATEMENT  (1974)
&gt;Approved by the Board of Trustees, December 1970
&gt;This statement was prepared by the Committee on Psychiatry and Psychology.

&gt;Because of professional and legal considerations, the ultimate medical responsibility for patients admitted to hospitals should remain with licensed physicians. Psychologists, like other nonmedical professionals, should be eligible for some type of hospital appointment

	*Affirmative Action &gt;POSITION STATEMENT
&gt;Approved by the Board of Trustees, December 1977 &gt;Approved by the Assembly of District Branches, October 1977
&gt; This statement was prepared by the Committee of Black Psychiatrists1 and recommended by the Council on National Affairs 
&gt;THERE IS a continuous need to increase the number of minority psychiatrists; the American Psychiatric Association has consistently demonstrated its commitment to the principle of affirmative action as reflected in its efforts of recruitment and training of minority psychiatrists. APA has previously developed and instituted policies recognizing and supporting the special mental health issues of minority populations; however, there are serious threats to affirmative action programs that have facilitated the following endeavors: APA reaffirms these commitments and policies by 1) issuing a public statement drawing attention to the potential deleterious effects that such threats pose to the delivery of health services to minority groups; 2) actively participating with other professional and educational groups to assure continued recruitment and training of minority candidates in medical disciplines; and 3) further exploring and developing, through its appropriate components, mechanisms to assure continued implementation of these commitments. 


 	##### Research committee Issues

Unless otherwise noted, these should be brought to the research committee for discussion by the gamemaster.  If Milgram and Zimbardo are not in the game, those will need to be brought as well. The actual papers should be made available to the students who will be presenting the data, if the activities are not actually performed (they are on http://www2.mcdaniel.edu/pbradley/reacting/).
1971: 
	Shepard &amp; Metzler's 'mental rotation of three-dimensional objects' task is already approved, the task should be presented to the students, and Miller prepped on presenting the data (you'll have to register for an account here: http://opl.apa.org/Experiments/About/AboutMentalRotation.aspx), 

	Siegelman “Adjustment of Homosexual and Heterosexual Women” (likely approve) (proposed by Barbara Gittings, if in game, if not, gamemaster)

	Watson (1920). “Conditioned Emotional Reactions” http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Watson/emotion.htm* (likely reject) (proposed by gamemaster)

*Students may recognize this experiment, although I don't use the name 'little albert' in the description. They will also probably find the experiment unethical.  Many people do.  It is important not to salve that response with the standard myth that Watson deconditioned Albert after the experiment: there is no evidence that he did, or that he ever intended to. Thus, my version of the proposed experiment contains no plan for deconditioning Albert. See the 'Actual History' section below for citations.

**1973-1974: Spitzer proposes to calculate Cohen's Kappa for existing measures of reliability of psychiatric diagnosis. If the student is skilled in basic statistics, and has access to the medical literature, he or she should be encouraged to replicate the study. If this is an intro-level class without statistics, the student can present a research report of the actual study, which is available via pubmed DOI 10.1192/bjp.125.4.341

Of course, Little Albert and Rosehan cannot be completed by actual students. If the research committee approves those experiments, the instructor should charge a student with presenting the original papers during the follow years' conference.
 	#### Activities
Various students should be tasked with presenting proposals for research to the research committee, conducting that research if it is chosen, and presenting the findings at the following conference.  Not everything proposed can be carried out in an undergraduate classroom. Where it is impossible, the instructor should distribute the actual paper for evaluation as if it had been carried out. The instructors is, of course, encouraged to use classroom activities with which he or she is familiar. 

I've pulled a number of experiments from the APA's Activities Handbook for the Teaching of Psychology v. 1-4 that correspond to many of the topics the class will be discussing. They are listed here, and attached as PDFs at the end of this document, if you do not have access to the Handbooks. The characters listed here are suggestions.  The instructor should distribute these as he or she sees fit.

Note: Milgram and Zimbardo, if they are in the game, are directly instructed to propose experiments to the research committee ('small world' and 'prison' respectively). Spitzer and Fordney Settlage also have instructions to present studies based on their character's actual work.

DEFENSE NNECHANISMS .fack J. Greider
This activit5r is designed to increase student familiarity with the ways in which defense mechanisms are used. In addition to being a good teaching tool, the activity allows for the expression of a considerable amount of creativity on the part of the students' Defense mechanisms covered include regression, rationalization, repression, projection, fantasy, compensation, identification, and reaction formatjon.
Ask for eight student volunteers for a role-playing exercise' I usually choose four males and four females, since I have found mixed pairs to work best in this activity. Have these eight students leave the room and go with them to explain what they are to do. First group them in male-female pairs and assign two of the defense mechanisms to each pair. Instruct each pair of students to make up two skits, one for each of the mechanisms. I usually allow them about 15 minutes to prepare their skits. While they are working, go back into the room, list the defense mechanisms on the chalkboard, and discuss each one briefly with the class. Then call the role players back into the room to put on their skits. Have each pair perform one of their two skits, and after going through the pairs have each pair do their second skit. The job of t]le class is to guess which mechanism each skit represents.
In discussion you can point out the place of defense mechanisms in personality theory. You should comment on the role of defense mechanisms in normal functioning. When are these mechanisms helpfi:l? When are tlrey harmfr.rl? Conduct an anonyrnous survey of your students asking them to indicate whether or not they have used any of the defense mechanisms during the past year. Do they use some defense mechanisms more tltan others? If so, which ones?

            <Text> The Effects of Segregation and the Consequences of Desegregation
A (September 1952) Social Science Statement
in the Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka Supreme Court Case
Kenneth B. Clark, Isidor Chein, and Stuart W. Cook
     The problem of the segregation of racial and ethnic groups constitutes one of the major problems facing the American people today. It seems desirable, therefore, to summarize the contributions which contem- porary social science can make toward its resolution. There are, of course, moral and legal issues involved with respect to which the signers of the present statement cannot speak with any special authority and which must be taken into account in the solution of the problem. There are, however, also factual issues involved with respect to which certain conclusions seem to be justified on the basis of the avail- able scientific evidence. It is with these issues only that this paper is concerned. Some of the issues have to do with the consequences of segregation, some with the problems of changing from segregated to unsegregated practices. These two groups of issues will be dealt with in separate sections below. It is necessary, first, however, to define and delimit the problem to be discussed.
Definitions
For purposes of the present statement, segregation refers to that restriction of opportunities for different types of asso- ciations between the members of one racial, religious, national or geographic origin, or linguistic group and those of other groups, which results from or is supported by the action of any official body or agency representing some branch of government. We are not here concerned with such segregation as arises from the free movements of individuals which are neither enforced nor supported by official bodies, nor with the segregation of criminals or of individuals with communicable diseases which aims at protecting society from those who might harm it.
Where the action takes place in a social milieu in which the groups involved do not enjoy equal social status, the group that is of lesser social status will be referred to as the segregated group.
In dealing with the question of the effects of segrega- tion, it must be recognized that these effects do not take place in a vacuum, but in a social context. The segregation of Negroes and of other groups in the United States takes place in a social milieu in which “race” prejudice and discrimination exist. It is questionable in the view of some

students of the problem whether it is possible to have segregation without substantial discrimination. Myrdal1 states: “Segregation . . . is financially possible and, indeed, a device of economy only as it is combined with substantial discrimination” (p. 629). The imbededness of segregation in such a context makes it difficult to disentangle the effects of segregation per se from the effects of the context. Similarly, it is difficult to disentangle the effects of segre- gation from the effects of a pattern of social disorganization commonly associated with it and reflected in high disease and mortality rates, crime and delinquency, poor housing, disrupted family life and general substandard living condi- tions. We shall, however, return to this problem after consideration of the observable effects of the total social complex in which segregation is a major component.
At the recent Mid-century White House Conference on Children and Youth, a fact-finding report on the effects of prejudice, discrimination and segregation on the person- ality development of children was prepared as a basis for some of the deliberations.2 This report brought together the available social science and psychological studies which were related to the problem of how racial and religious prejudices influenced the development of a healthy person- ality. It highlighted the fact that segregation, prejudices and discriminations, and their social concomitants potentially damage the personality of all children—the children of the majority group in a somewhat different way than the more obviously damaged children of the minority group.
The report indicates that as minority group children learn the inferior status to which they are assigned—as they

observe the fact that they are almost always segregated and kept apart from others who are treated with more respect by the society as a whole—they often react with feelings of inferiority and a sense of personal humiliation. Many of them become confused about their own personal worth. On the one hand, like all other human beings they require a sense of personal dignity; on the other hand, almost no- where in the larger society do they find their own dignity as human beings respected by others. Under these conditions, the minority group child is thrown into a conflict with regard to his feelings about himself and his group. He wonders whether his group and he himself are worthy of no more respect than they receive. This conflict and confusion leads to self-hatred and rejection of his own group.
The report goes on to point out that these children must find ways with which to cope with this conflict. Not every child, of course, reacts with the same patterns of behavior. The particular pattern depends upon many inter- related factors, among which are: the stability and quality of his family relations; the social and economic class to which he belongs; the cultural and educational background of his parents; the particular minority group to which he belongs; his personal characteristics, intelligence, special talents, and personality pattern.
Some children, usually of the lower socio-economic
classes, may react by overt aggressions and hostility di-
rected toward their own group or members of the dominant
3
group. Anti-social and delinquent behavior may often be
interpreted as reactions to these racial frustrations. These reactions are self-destructive in that the larger society not only punishes those who commit them, but often interprets such aggressive and anti-social behavior as justification for continuing prejudice and segregation.
Middle class and upper class minority group children are likely to react to their racial frustrations and conflicts by withdrawal and submissive behavior. Or, they may react with compensatory and rigid conformity to the prevailing middle class values and standards and an aggressive deter- mination to succeed in these terms in spite of the handicap of their minority status.
The report indicates that minority group children of all social and economic classes often react with a generally defeatist attitude and a lowering of personal ambitions. This, for example, is reflected in a lowering of pupil morale and a depression of the educational aspiration level among minority group children in segregated schools. In produc- ing such effects, segregated schools impair the ability of the child to profit from the educational opportunities pro- vided him.
Many minority group children of all classes also tend to be hypersensitive and anxious about their relations with the larger society. They tend to see hostility and rejection even in those areas where these might not actually exist.
The report concludes that while the range of individ- ual differences among members of a rejected minority group is as wide as among other peoples, the evidence suggests that all of these children are unnecessarily encum- bered in some ways by segregation and its concomitants.
With reference to the impact of segregation and its concomitants on children of the majority group, the report indicates that the effects are somewhat more obscure. Those children who learn the prejudices of our society are also being taught to gain personal status in an unrealistic and non-adaptive way. When comparing themselves to members of the minority group, they are not required to evaluate themselves in terms of the more basic standards of actual personal ability and achievement. The culture per- mits and, at times, encourages them to direct their feelings of hostility and aggression against whole groups of people the members of which are perceived as weaker than them- selves. They often develop patterns of guilt feelings, ratio- nalizations and other mechanisms which they must use in an attempt to protect themselves from recognizing the essential injustice of their unrealistic fears and hatreds of minority groups.4
The report indicates further that confusion, conflict, moral cynicism, and disrespect for authority may arise in majority group children as a consequence of being taught the moral, religious and democratic principles of the broth- erhood of man and the importance of justice and fair play by the same persons and institutions who, in their support of racial segregation and related practices, seem to be acting in a prejudiced and discriminatory manner. Some individuals may attempt to resolve this conflict by intensi- fying their hostility toward the minority group. Others may react by guilt feelings which are not necessarily reflected in more humane attitudes toward the minority group. Still others react by developing an unwholesome, rigid, and uncritical idealization of all authority figures—their par- ents, strong political and economic leaders. As described in The Authoritarian Personality,5 they despise the weak, while they obsequiously and unquestioningly conform to the demands of the strong whom they also, paradoxically, subconsciously hate.
With respect to the setting in which these difficulties
develop, the report emphasized the role of the home, the
6
school, and other social institutions. Studies have shown
that from the earliest school years children are not only aware of the status differences among different groups in the society but begin to react with the patterns described above.

September 2004 ● American Psychologist
Conclusions similar to those reached by the Mid- century White House Conference Report have been stated by other social scientists who have concerned themselves with this problem. The following are some examples of these conclusions:
Segregation imposes upon individuals a distorted
7 sense of social reality.
Segregation leads to a blockage in the communications
and interaction between the two groups. Such blockages tend
8 to increase mutual suspicion, distrust and hostility.
Segregation not only perpetuates rigid stereotypes and
reinforces negative attitudes toward members of the other
group, but also leads to the development of a social climate
within which violent outbreaks of racial tensions are likely
9 to occur.
We return now to the question, deferred earlier, of what it is about the total society complex of which segre- gation is one feature that produces the effects described above—or, more precisely, to the question of whether we can justifiably conclude that, as only one feature of a complex social setting, segregation is in fact a significantly contributing factor to these effects.
To answer this question, it is necessary to bring to bear the general fund of psychological and sociological knowledge concerning the role of various environmental influences in producing feelings of inferiority, confusions in personal roles, various types of basic personality struc- tures and the various forms of personal and social disorganization.
On the basis of this general fund of knowledge, it seems likely that feelings of inferiority and doubts about personal worth are attributable to living in an underprivi- leged environment only insofar as the latter is itself per- ceived as an indicator of low social status and as a symbol of inferiority. In other words, one of the important deter- minants in producing such feelings is the awareness of social status difference. While there are many other factors that serve as reminders of the differences in social status, there can be little doubt that the fact of enforced segrega-
10 tion is a major factor.
This seems to be true for the following reasons among others: (1) because enforced segregation results from the decision of the majority group without the consent of the segregated and is commonly so perceived; and (2) because historically segregation patterns in the United States were developed on the assumption of the inferiority of the segregated.
In addition, enforced segregation gives official recog- nition and sanction to these other factors of the social complex, and thereby enhances the effects of the latter in creating the awareness of social status differences and
11
feelings of inferiority. The child who, for example, is
compelled to attend a segregated school may be able to

cope with ordinary expressions of prejudice by regarding the prejudiced person as evil or misguided; but he cannot readily cope with symbols of authority, the full force of the authority of the State—the school or the school board, in this instance—in the same manner. Given both the ordinary expression of prejudice and the school’s policy of segre- gation, the former takes on greater force and seemingly becomes an official expression of the latter.
Not all of the psychological traits which are com- monly observed in the social complex under discussion can be related so directly to the awareness of status differenc- es—which in turn is, as we have already noted, materially contributed to by the practices of segregation. Thus, the low level of aspiration and defeatism so commonly ob- served in segregated groups is undoubtedly related to the level of self-evaluation; but it is also, in some measure, related among other things to one’s expectations with re- gard to opportunities for achievement and, having achieved, to the opportunities for making use of these achievements. Similarly, the hypersensitivity and anxiety displayed by many minority group children about their relations with the larger society probably reflects their awareness of status differences; but it may also be influ- enced by the relative absence of opportunities for equal status contact which would provide correctives for prevail- ing unrealistic stereotypes.
The preceding view is consistent with the opinion stated by a large majority (90%) of social scientists who replied to a questionnaire concerning the probable effects of enforced segregation under conditions of equal facilities. This opinion was that, regardless of the facilities which are provided, enforced segregation is psychologically detri-
12 mental to the members of the segregated group.
Similar considerations apply to the question of what features of the social complex of which segregation is a part contribute to the development of the traits which have been observed in majority group members. Some of these are probably quite closely related to the awareness of status differences, to which, as has already been pointed out, segregation makes a material contribution. Others have a more complicated relationship to the total social setting. Thus, the acquisition of an unrealistic basis for self-evalu- ation as a consequence of majority group membership probably reflects fairly closely the awareness of status differences. On the other hand, unrealistic fears and hatreds of minority groups, as in the case of the converse phenom-

enon among minority group members, are probably signif- icantly influenced as well by the lack of opportunities for equal status contact.
With reference to the probable effects of segregation
under conditions of equal facilities on majority group mem-
bers, many of the social scientists who responded to the
poll in the survey cited above felt that the evidence is less
convincing than with regard to the probable effects of such
segregation on minority group members, and the effects are
possibly less widespread. Nonetheless, more than 80%
stated it as their opinion that the effects of such segregation
are psychologically detrimental to the majority group
13 members.
It may be noted that many of these social scientists supported their opinions on the effects of segregation on both majority and minority groups by reference to one or another or to several of the following four lines of pub-
14
lished and unpublished evidence. First, studies of chil-
dren throw light on the relative priority of the awareness of status differentials and related factors as compared to the awareness of differences in facilities. On this basis, it is possible to infer some of the consequences of segregation as distinct from the influence of inequalities of facilities. Second, clinical studies and depth interviews throw light on the genetic sources and causal sequences of various pat- terns of psychological reaction; and, again, certain infer- ences are possible with respect to the effects of segregation per se. Third, there actually are some relevant but relatively rare instances of segregation with equal or even superior facilities, as in the cases of certain Indian reservations. Fourth, since there are inequalities of facilities in racially and ethnically homogeneous groups, it is possible to infer the kinds of effects attributable to such inequalities in the absence of effects of segregation and, by a kind of subtrac- tion to estimate the effects of segregation per se in situa- tions where one finds both segregation and unequal facilities.
Segregation is at present a social reality. Questions may be raised, therefore, as to what are the likely conse- quences of desegregation.
One such question asks whether the inclusion of an intellectually inferior group may jeopardize the education of the more intelligent group by lowering educational stan- dards or damage the less intelligent group by placing it in a situation where it is at a marked competitive disadvan- tage. Behind this question is the assumption, which is examined below, that the presently segregated groups ac- tually are inferior intellectually.
The available scientific evidence indicates that much, perhaps all, of the observable differences among various racial and national groups may be adequately explained in
15
terms of environmental differences. It has been found, for
instance, that the differences between the average intelli-
gence test scores of Negro and white children decrease, and
the overlap of the distributions increases, proportionately to
the number of years that the Negro children have lived in
16
the North. Related studies have shown that this change
cannot be explained by the hypothesis of selective migra-
17
tion. It seems clear, therefore, that fears based on the
assumption of innate racial differences in intelligence are not well founded.
It may also be noted in passing that the argument regarding the intellectual inferiority of one group as com- pared to another is, as applied to schools, essentially an argument for homogeneous groupings of children by intel- ligence rather than by race. Since even those who believe that there are innate differences between Negroes and whites in America in average intelligence grant that con- siderable overlap between the two groups exists, it would follow that it may be expedient to group together the superior whites and Negroes, the average whites and Ne- groes, and so on. Actually, many educators have come to doubt the wisdom of class groupings made homogeneous solely on the basis of intelligence.18 Those who are op- posed to such homogeneous grouping believe that this type of segregation, too, appears to create generalized feelings of inferiority in the child who attends a below average class, leads to undesirable emotional consequences in the education of the gifted child, and reduces learning oppor- tunities which result from the interaction of individuals with varied gifts.
A second problem that comes up in an evaluation of the possible consequences of desegregation involves the question of whether segregation prevents or stimulates interracial tension and conflict and the corollary question of whether desegregation has one or the other effect.
The most direct evidence available on this problem comes from observations and systematic study of instances in which desegregation has occurred. Comprehensive re-
19
views of such instances clearly establish the fact that
desegregation has been carried out successfully in a variety of situations although outbreaks of violence had been com- monly predicted. Extensive desegregation has taken place without major incidents in the armed services in both Northern and Southern installations and involving officers and enlisted men from all parts of the country, including

the South.20 Similar changes have been noted in housing21
22
and industry. During the last war, many factories both in
the North and South hired Negroes on a non-segregated, non-discriminatory basis. While a few strikes occurred, refusal by management and unions to yield quelled all
23 strikes within a few days.
Relevant to this general problem is a comprehensive study of urban race riots which found that race riots oc- curred in segregated neighborhoods, whereas there was no violence in sections of the city where the two races lived, worked and attended school together.24
Under certain circumstances desegregation not only proceeds without major difficulties, but has been observed to lead to the emergence of more favorable attitudes and friendlier relations between races. Relevant studies may be
25 26
cited with respect to housing, employment, the armed
27 28 29 services and merchant marine, recreation agency, and
30 general community life.
Much depends, however, on the circumstances under which members of previously segregated groups first come in contact with others in unsegregated situations. Available evidence suggests, first, that there is less likelihood of unfriendly relations when the change is simultaneously introduced into all units of a social institution to which it is applicable— e.g., all of the schools in a school system or all
31
of the shops in a given factory. When factories introduced
Negroes in only some shops but not in others the prejudiced workers tended to classify the desegregated shops as infe- rior, “Negro work.” Such objections were not raised when complete integration was introduced.
The available evidence also suggests the importance
of consistent and firm enforcement of the new policy by
32
those in authority. It indicates also the importance of such
factors as: the absence of competition for a limited number
33
of facilities or benefits; the possibility of contacts which
permit individuals to learn about one another as individu-
34
als; and the possibility of equivalence of positions and
functions among all of the participants within the unsegre- gated situation.35 These conditions can generally be satis- fied in a number of situations, as in the armed services, public housing developments, and public schools.
The problem with which we have here attempted to deal is admittedly on the frontiers of scientific knowledge. Inevitably, there must be some differences of opinion among us concerning the conclusiveness of certain items of evidence, and concerning the particular choice of words and placement of emphasis in the preceding statement. We are nonetheless in agreement that this statement is substan- tially correct and justified by the evidence, and the differ- ences among us, if any, are of a relatively minor order and would not materially influence the preceding conclusions.

            <Title>Clark-1958-AQuestionOfValues</Title>
            <Text> A Question of Values
Having read K. E. Clark's America's Psychologists and the recent statement by Division 12 of the new requirement for fellowship status of "a significant con- tribution," we were impressed with the fact that either intentionally or unintentionally values are playing an increasingly significant role in determining the criteria which will be selected as appropriate for assessing the status of professional psychologists.
It is interesting to note in this connection that in Clark's book much emphasis is given to research publi- cation as a means of differentiating "significant con- tributors" from their ostensibly less productive col- leagues. It is apparent that discrimination on this basis has the advantages of objectivity and ease of determi- nation. There are certainly other equally important criteria, however difficult to measure, which the clinical psychologist might suggest: such as skill in diagnosis and therapy, number of patients benefited through treat- ment, direct and indirect contributions to the solution of mental hygiene problems in the community. The teacher of psychology would, we think, have still other pertinent criteria which he might consider of major import: such as the number of students toward whose education he has substantially contributed, the number of students he has motivated to pursue further study in psychology, and contributions to mental health through informal counseling.
The point we are trying to make is that a value system to a large extent determines what functions or productions are to be considered worthy and thus tends to sustain them. It should be remembered that Clark's book addresses itself, not only to research psychologists, but to the entire profession as well as to any other in- terested intelligent reader. Surely some consideration could have been given to other professional endeavors which are of significance to a large number of psychol- ogists. It is recognized that Clark and his co-workers cannot be criticized for delimiting their area of inves- tigation; but, if the book is intended to present infor- mation about all of America's psychologists, then errors of omission can loom as large as errors of commission. Clark himself reports that about three times as many psychologists are members of Division 12 than any other division. Might not some valuable hypotheses, amenable to research investigation, have been forthcom- ing from this large group as well as from the smaller number of psychology teachers? And what about prob- lems that appear significant for which no appropriate methodology currently exists? These oversights or neglect trouble us. We see it as a sign of things to
**
come; perhaps, the structure of the APA may be seri- ously threatened.
Even Division 12 seems to be suffering from this same (unrecognized?) conflict. New fellows will have to have made an "outstanding contribution" to psychology. Will these contributions be limited to those which can be reliably and validly investigated, leaving the impor- tant service and teaching functions to be relegated to secondary importance because of the difficulty in estab- lishing valid criteria for their assessment? Or is it to be a long list of (significant?) publications that will be the summum bonum? Was it W. S. Maugham in his Summing Up who said that writing a book was inher- ently no more valuable an activity than plowing a field? The value lies in the eyes of the doer (and perhaps in the contribution to others).
We might add that this question of values pervades many diverse areas in psychology, including psycho- metric assessment and teaching. In "Comments on Meehl and Rosen's Paper" (Psychol. Bull., 19S6, 53, 335-337) by S. Karson and S. B. Sells, essentially the same problem was raised. Certain remarks by S. L. Pressey in "Teaching in the Ivory Tower, with Rarely a Step Outside" (Psychol. Bull, 1955, 52, 343-344) are especially relevant. Although his plea is for a wider range of experiment in teaching evaluation studies, his words (p. 344) are noteworthy:
Climb higher in the ivory tower! Why not instead come down and open the door, watch what students do outside class, see what psychologists are doing in the wide world, and even venture off campus occasionally, to mix with the folks on Main Street.

A Reply
The comments of Karson, Baler, and Carroll suggest that the planning of the program of research reported in America's Psychologists intentionally or unintention- ally was influenced by value judgments. What they mean to say, obviously, is that they believe the wrong values were assigned, especially in the study of factors influencing an individual psychologist's research contri- butions to psychology. I gather that Karson, Baler, and Carroll would rather have had us study the contri- bution of individual psychologists to the solution of individual and society problems. I would like to see somebody make such a study; I do no.t believe Amer- ica's Psychologists should be criticized for having done

a different type of study than this, nor should it be concluded that we avoided use of clinical criteria simply because they were too difficult to assess.
The emphasis given to research publication, to which Karson, Baler, and Carroll object, occurred in our study of the way in which significant contributors dif- fered from their less productive colleagues. Attention to publication was essential, we felt, since any contri- bution to science necessarily involves comunication with one's fellows about results.

America's Psychologists did give consideration to other professional endeavors. One chapter deals with the comparative characteristics of clinical psychologists and of psychologists in other areas of specialization. Another includes a survey of private practice in clin- ical psychology in Los Angeles. Both of these studies involve no evaluation of the individual clinician, but still provide useful insights into the nature of contribu- tions being made by these persons.
Of course, we were dealing with values in making decisions about the way to proceed in the study of client, but it is not communicated to other psychol- American psychology. Our responsibility was to rec-
ogists. Likewise, the therapist may gain great skill in ognize what values we held and to make them explicit
his work and become an exceedingly capable person; but, unless he has some method, either in the training of others or through his writing, to convey what he has learned to his colleagues, he has not made a contribu- tion to psychology. Our study included in the signifi- cant contributor group a substantial number of clinical psychologists. These persons might have been nom- inated either because of their writing or because of the substantial training programs they directed for clinical psychologists, but not solely because they were excel- lent therapists. Note our directions to raters:
One of the studies being conducted under Project B is an investigation of factors influencing the productivity of research psychologists. Part of this study involves the de- velopment of a small sample of persons considered by their colleagues to have made significant research contributions in psychology, either through their own original work, or through their part in training research workers, this sample to be drawn from a larger roster of persons who have be- come "visible" to their colleagues through substantial con- tributions to the research literature. . . .
You are asked to nominate those persons whom you con- sider to have made the most significant contributions to psychology as a science, cither through scientific work of their own, or through their work in the training of research psychologists.
in our account. What these values were is revealed to any careful reader through the detailed procedures em- ployed in our study. In this respect, our study is no different from any other experimental investigation. While we were not willing to stop with a study that directed its attention only toward the characteristics of research psychologists, we did feel that they deserved primary attention, since the field of psychology can grow and develop only with a continuing increment to knowledge. Many clinical psychologists do not make contributions to science as science is normally defined; that they do make contributions is recognized by all.
I think we need to recognize that all of American psychology is today perplexed about the relative values to assign to research and to service in our growing field. Karson, Baler, and Carroll protest that decisions are being made about the desired characteristics of a clin- ical psychologist on traditional bases without enough attention being given to changing conditions and new roles played by clinical psychologists. For this posi- tion I think they can find full and unqualified support in America's Psychologists.

            <Text>### Major Issues in the Game

All psychological theories hold that human action can be predicted based on previous actions of that human.  The way it makes those predictions---and the underlying mechanisms posited that explain those actions---separates psychological theories from each other.

When I say ‘mechanism’, I am using a very specific notion in the Philosophy of science.  A mechanism is an organization of underlying entities which interact with each other to create the phenomenon of interest.  Biologists talk of cell mechanisms, Doctors and Pharmacists of drug actions and mechanisms, Chemists speak of the mechanisms of reactions, etc.  

When one looks at the history of psychological theories, it is not hard to see the metaphorical connections between the psychological mechanisms posited at a certain time, and the most complicated machines available to that society. Psychoanalysis, which was dominants in American Psychiatry from 1890 until  1974, posits an underlying unconscious, which ‘boils’ away, providing energy for all observable behavior.  When that behavior is correctly directed with the right set of pressures, it moves the organism forward. When it is not, either the pressure goes out sideways, creating negative behaviors, or it builds towards ultimate ‘explosion’ in psychosis.  It is, in short, a steam engine.

Behaviorism - mechanism of stimulus and response, metaphor to training animal behavior.

Cognitivism -- metaphor of the computer. informational input, behavioral output, executive function, expert systems, algorithmic thinking

The main issue of debate in this game is whether or not psychoanalysis is a viable theory of human action.  The issue of the medicalization of homosexuality is merely the tip of the iceberg---an issue which made the problem of psychoanalysis prominent to the psychological and psychiatric communities in the 1970’s.

TO SLEER PERCFTANCE TO DREAM Ludy T. Benjamin, Jr.
There are probably more m5rths and misunderstandings about sleep and dreaming than about any other aspect of human behavior except sex.
For most people, sleep and dreamingwill occupy one third of their lives, yet few individuals are aware of even the most rudimentary information about this activity. For example, consider tJre following facts: Apparently everyone dreams; that i;, there are no nondreamers, only nonrecallers. In an 8-hour night of sleep most people will have from four to five dreams, usually on quite unrelated topics. The great majority of dreams are in color. Sleep leaming apparently does not occur. Dreams are not always filled with easily interpretable psychological meanings, as popular literature would have one believe.
The study of sleep and dreaming is still in its infancy. Most of what we know about this area is the result of research occurring in the last 25 years and is principally due to the development of electrophysiological techniques (particularly the electroencephalograph, or EEG) and the discovery, in 1953, of rapid eye movements (REMs) during sleep.
The purposes of this exercise are (a) to help students focus attention on their own sleep and dreaming patterns, (b) to generate data for class discussion, (c) to introduce students to the concept of data collection in sleep and dreaming, (d) to illustrate appropriate statistical measures for summarizing the data, and (e) to aid students in understanding the interpretation of data in general and these data in particular.
Pass out the "Sleep and Dreaming Record" to each student, providing multiple copies-one for each day that records will be kept (14 consecutive nights provides a good sample). Tell the students why the data are being collected and indicate that participation is voh:ntary. Explain that they can conceal their identity by marking their records with a number (six or seven digits in length) that they make up on their own. This procedure allows them to identify their statistics in reference to others in class when the srurunary data are provided later. Note that it takes only about 5 minutes each day to complete tlre record.
Ask all students to begrn their records on the same day and to keep their record sheets at home. Request ttrat during the time the records are being kept, discussion among students regarding their sleep and dreaming pattems be minimal to avoid unintentional influences on the data. Give explicit instructions on record keeping. (It is a good idea to have one "practice run" to insure that everyone understands the record- keeping system before continuing for 14 days.) The record provided is only a sample. Feel free to modify it as appropriate.
When the time period is completed and students have turned in all of their records, the tedious part begins for the fsagfrgl-ths

surnmarization of the data, for which a calculator is most helpful. Each student's records should be summarized separately, and data should be anaTyzedfor the group as a whole. A summary sheet for the students should then be prepared, which lists everyone who participated (by number) and provides the group analyses. For example, Student
# rcZAS+ can examine tl-rat column number of the summary sheet to find a mean sleep time of 7.3 hours (over 14 days), with a range of 5.6-9.7 hours. The student can then compare these figures with those of other students and with those for the class as a whole, based on the group data.

Although it is not necessar5z, teachers may wish to provide some statistical measures of relationship between some of the variables for which they have collected data by using the technique of correlation. For example, is there a relationship betweenthe number of hours people sleep and tlre number of dreams theyr6call? Or is there a relationship between the subjective sleep qualityrating and the number of awakenings one exlrriences during the night? A number of correlational anal5rses can be computed to answpq these and other questions. To
compute tlrese values, a calculator id needed. Some calculators have a built-in correlation ftrnction; othenfise, the computational formula in Appendix A shor.rld be used. It is important to remember that correlation is a measure of the degree to which two variables are related and does not necessarily specify the natwe of tlre relationship.

            <Text> THEEAT AND CHALLENGE OF A PRESIDENTIAL ADDRESS
HERE is something about the aura of the Tterm "presidential address" which makes it a special burden and a special source of anxiety for everyone involved. Every speech, ad- dress, article, or essay exposes an important part of oneself for critical examination by an audience or by readers. For a long time, I have tried to per- suade my students that everything that a person writes—all forms of communication—may be viewed as projective materials which reveal aspects of the totality and the complexity of his personality to sensitive observers. If this is true it would follow that to communicate to psychologists, who view themselves as experts in the analysis of per- sonality and character, is to invite not only an analysis of the substance of what one communicates, but also to expose oneself to probing and critical examination. There must be an incorrigible ego drive which propels one to assume the risks of ex- posure to an audience of psychologists, given the fact that the threat of exposure is greater the more accurate are the judgments concerning the character
and wisdom of the speaker.
There remains the problem of how can one make
a presidential address in some way worth the anxie- ties and risks? One could use it as an opportunity to try to clarify the underlying conceptual frame- work implicit in his thoughts, research, writing, teaching, and social action. In one's personal and professional life, it is possible to move from project to project and from encounter to encounter, and to take on a variety of responsibilities and roles with- out having the time to give thought to the theo-

retical and philosophical perspectives which, hope- fully, unify and give some coherence to one's life and activities. It would be reassuring, especially in the latter stages of one's life, to discover that there is theoretical coherence and unity in one's professional activities and his role as a person and as a citizen.
A search for congruence and consistency among the various aspects of one's being would seem man- datory, if not inevitable, for those who are arrogant enough to use the discipline of psychology to legiti- mize their functioning. The luxury and safety of defining scientific objectivity in terms of a detached, disciplined, isolated, and amoral use of human intelligence are not available to those who have chosen to work in the social, psychological, and be- havior sciences or for that matter in the biological and medical sciences.
The research topics, findings, and analyses and insights of a psychologist cannot be divorced from the total complexity of his being. Psychological phenomena do not seem to consist of absolute reali- ties. Their reality is the tantalizing, persistent reality of the subjective. This fact of relativistic reality differentiates the science of psychology from all other sciences. This difference between psy- chology and the physical sciences remains in spite of the fact that the evidence of all sciences—in- deed, the inevitable basis of all knowledge—must be filtered through the limits of human observa- tional powers and refined by limited human intelli- gence.
Psychologists and other social scientists must seek to organize their findings within a conceptual framework which hopefully will expand knowledge and broaden and deepen insights into the nature of man and his society. There remains, also, for psy- chology, the ultimate test of the validity of all sci- ences, namely, a demonstration of an effective tech- nology—the ability to predict or control the phe- nomena which we purport to understand.

cal questions for a contemporary science of psy- chology and for other behavioral sciences are: What arc their contributions to the understanding and control of the behavior of human beings? How can the knowledge, the insights, and the re- lated technology contribute directly or indirectly to effectiveness of individual human beings, to stabil- ity in human society, and increase the chances of survival of the human species?
These are important questions, and there is now a special urgency in finding and implementing af- firmative answers to them within the context of respect for human values. What follows are the views of a person who has spent his adult life in research, teaching, writing, and social action within the discipline of social psychology as to the basis for and the direction within which humane affirma- tive answers might be found. It is also an at- tempt to share with others the process—the intel- lectual and emotional turbulence—by which these views and related suggestions concerning the dy- namics of man and society emerged.
INFLUKNCK OF EARLY RESEARCH ON DICVKLOPJNG JDKAS
My first serious scientific involvement in the larger theoretical concerns with the nature of man and society emerged as a result of the need to interpret the findings of the early research on the nature and development of the self and the problems of ego and racial identification. In these studies 1 was a collaborator with my wife, Dr. Mamie Clark. This fascinating and somewhat illusive "pure" re- search problem was initially my wife's Master's thesis problem. As she saw the larger implications of the first stages of this work, she was kind enough to invite me to join her in a more probing empirical and theoretical exploration of the nature and determinants of the self-image.
As we collected and analyzed the data obtained through the methods we used, we became im- pressed with the implications of the observation that in the initial stages of the emerging sense of self in children the substance and the dynamics of the functioning ego were determined almost ex- clusively by external pressures, determinants, and evaluative agents. These findings provided the first clues for insights concerning the fragility, vulnera- bility, dependence, indeed, the pathos of the human ego. This early research on the emergence of self-
awareness and preference in Negro children illumi- nated for us the larger pattern of problems related to ego development in human beings. Among these insights were:
• The functional substance of the self is not in- digenous to the human organism, but is determined by the nature and pattern of human interaction as this is influenced by the status of the individual in a familial and social hierarchical system. (By the way the individual is perceived and generally treated.)
• The qualitative effect of the external determi- nants of the individual's sense of self is inevitably evaluative; that is, the resulting emerging self- image inevitably brings with it a positive or nega- tive sense of the worth of self.
• This positive or negative evaluative component of self is inevitable and pivotal—and in its most primary and basic sense is not controlled by the individual himself but by others over whom he has no control.
• In the most formative and susceptible stage of a child's life, that period within which there is the beginning of the ability to cope with ideas, the idea of the self and the worth and status of the self are inextricable.
• This initial external definition of the nature, worth, and status of self tends to persist through- out the life of the individual, in that it is reinforced by consistent experiences, is internalized as the core of personality, and establishes the patterns of defense and protection which the individual uses in interpersonal and other forms of social interaction.
• In spite of the above, human beings—except those who have been totally defeated by negative evaluation of others and by consistent rejection, or those who are organically deficient—persist in the struggle for self-affirmation and the attainment of that minimum self-esteem required to continue to function as a human being. Tt remains one of the mysteries of psychological science that individual human beings differ—whether markedly or mini- mally is still open to question—in the physical equipment, intellectual strengths and general life force, and other personal resources which they can mobilize in the continuing struggle for personal affirmation and an effective self-esteem.
My research on the social and attitudinal factors influencing memory and recall—related to the larger
 problem of the effect of social factors on percep- tion and cognition—tended to reinforce my ideas concerning the fragility of the human ego. This early study, conducted in partial fulfillment for the doctorate at Columbia University incidentally, not only anticipated some of the later research on cog- nitive styles but also foreshadowed some of the concerns of the Women's Liberation movement in the finding that men and women differed markedly in the recall of the activities of a dominant woman. The finding that human beings tended to recall events in terms consistent with their attitudes and within the context of their personality seemed to
provide further supportive evidence of the human need to use all available sensory and intellective resources in the attempt to obscure the tenuousness of our being—and to assert an inner certainty and absoluteness as having reality and existence pri- marily because they are asserted.
Further studies of the effects of social pressures and the consequences of rejection and acceptance of individuals and groups by the larger society culmi- nated in the publication of Dark Ghetto. While the writing of Dark Ghetto drew on earlier research in- sights, this specific study of the psychological ef- fects of a ghetto community resulted in a more focused picture of the effects of adverse, persistent social negatives on the distortion of personality and on the impairment of psychological effectiveness of the victims of persistent rejection. Here, again, the persistent fact of the fragility and vulnerability of the human ego, somewhat tempered by insights con- cerning the counterstruggle for self-esteem and resilience of human beings, was reinforced by the
findings of this community psychology research.
It may be of some value to point out that the earlier studies of the development of self-identifica-
Ghetto research on the other hand, from its incep- tion, was clearly motivated by the desire to influ- ence social policy and influence the decisions of those with power to facilitate, block, or determine the rate of desired social change. The Dark Ghetto study cannot be described with candor as an exer- cise in "pure" research on a problem of culture and personality. This study of the dynamics of a sys- tematically dehumanizing community on the hu- manity and effectiveness of the personalities con- fined within it was not conducted without concern for the implications of these findings for social jus- tice and social change.
The Harlem Youth Opportunities (HARYOU) report, Youth in the Ghetto, expanded and revised into Dark Ghetto, was modeled after investigations in public health and preventive medicine. These reports did seek to analyze and describe the effects of social policy and practice; diagnose the nature and manifestations of social instability; and sug- gested remedies for the persistent social insensitivi- ties and resulting pathologies which robbed human beings of self-esteem, reinforced negative self-im- ages, and destroyed the chances of personal and social effectiveness.
In a recent analysis of a sample of antipoverty programs—A Relevant War Against Poverty, co- authored with Jeannette Hopkins—it was clear that the Dark Ghetto findings had influenced the ra- tionale and programmatic structure of federally funded antipoverty and community-based action programs. But, this detailed study of these pro- grams within the first two years of the programs' existence predicted their failure by revealing the controlling and inhibiting fact that those human beings with power are deeply unwilling or unable to share even a modicum of real power with those who

These programs did not and would not operate in terms of the rationale and the goals of the potential equality of all human beings. They did not seek to accept and strengthen the humanity of the deprived through compassion, empathy, and a serious sharing of power.
AN EMERGING CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK
There is no doubt that these research projects, the developing ideas, and the related forms of so- cial action were influenced most, fundamentally by the psychodynamic theories of Alfred Adler. The late Francis Cecil Sunnier, Professor of Psychology at Howard University, introduced me to the ideas of Adlcr. It was Professor Sumner who first intro- duced me as an undergraduate to the promises of the science of psychology for the understanding of man and society. It was he who gave me my first serious appreciation of the complexities of the meanings of humanity. In his characteristic style, Professor Sumner presented Adler's thoughts with- in the framework of other psychoanalytic and psychodynamic theories and within the larger con- text of religion and philosophy. This experience had a profound influence on my thoughts, research, and professional and personal action.
The gestalt, wholistic, and organismic theories also exerted a strong influence on my developing ideas. Kurt Goldstein's ability to interpret his ob- servations of the meaning of the symptoms of the brain-injured patients in a unified psychodynamic perspective of the struggle of human beings to maintain an integrated ego—to minimize their deficiencies and maximize their available assets— reinforced the basic significance of Adlerian and organismic theory in my thinking. As one of Gold- stein's graduate students at Columbia University, f struggled to understand his lectures. T admired his ability to present and document a wholistic, organismic view of man as a biosocial organism.
pelled me more toward the social-psychological em- phasis of Adler and made me somewhat resistant to the Freudian emphasis on deeper intrapsychic dy- namics. In its emphasis on innate instinctive processes and its related inability to emphasize the effects of social problems and continued social pres- sures on the individual's effectiveness, traditional Freudian theory seemed inadequate—limited and constricted—for a dynamic social psychology. Freudian theory does not appear to offer a theo- retical basis for a psychology concerned with so- cial change or a psychotechnology other than one- to-one psychoanalytic therapy. Adler's concern with man's social interaction and his emphasis on the human struggle for self-esteem were much more compatible with my main research and action in seeking a humane technology to enhance the chances of humanity among men. The quest for a more enlightened social policy, morally and rationally determined social change, could not proceed from the premise that man is a totally or primarily non- rational organism whose most powerful drives are instinctive and animalistic. In this regard, my re- sistance to the Freudian perspective of man and society was not unlike the objections of the late Gordon Allport who refused to accept the Freudian view of man as an essentially nonrational being. Allport insisted that the rational components of the complexities of human motivation must be given at least an equal if not a dominant role with the non- rational.
The core Adlerian idea which persists in its influence on my thinking is the idea concerning the nature of psychological power in understanding human beings and human society. Bertrand Rus- sell's assertion that "the fundamental concept in social science is Power, in the same sense in which Energy is a fundamental concept in physics" rein- forced the influence of Adlerian theory in my think- ing. In his not too well-known book, Power, Bertrand Russell stated, "The laws of social dy- namics are—so I shall contend—only capable of being studied in terms of power in its various forms." He defines power rather pragmatically as "the production of intended effects."
In earlier exploration of the phenomenon of so- cial power, T defined it operationally as "the force or energy required to bring about, to sustain or to prevent social, political or economic change." As
In spite of the more dramatic, fashionable, pro-
vocative, and, in many respects, profound ideas of
Freud, my thoughts and scientific activities were
only peripherally influenced by the fundamental
Freudian premises. My persistent concerns with
the effects of the social system on the functioning
and effectiveness of individuals and groups pro- my research and my interest in social change in-
 terests tended to converge and eventually fuse, I became preoccupied with the problem of a theory of social power as a unifying conceptual framework. More and more I tended to see social power, in its manifest forms, as that force or combination of forces which facilitated, blocked, or determined the rate and direction of social change. In a dynamic social situation, power expresses itself as a gestalt or a quantum expression of the power aspirations and competition among significant individuals and groups.
need to use the crutches of racial cruelty and ex- tremism are also forlorn, deprived, desperately pa- thetic human beings.
When one dares to confront the many examples of the mocking pathos of power, one finds oneself going beyond Adler even as he remains dependent upon fundamental Adlerian insights. The Adlerian emphasis on the affirmative struggle for self-esteem and status becomes intensified by the disturbing, almost intolerable reality that a positive self-esteem, what Freud calls narcissism, is not determined by forces inherent within the human organism, but is dependent upon external supports and reinforce- ments, and controlled by the judgments of others who themselves are also afflicted with the universal human anxiety of self-doubt.

the capacity to love and be loved and thereby the universe. They make possible perception,
strengthens the cycle of self-defeating obsession with power.
A contemporary example of human power pathos is found in the anguished cries of the advocates of black power. In this phenomenon it is clear that the verbalizations of power betray the reality of powerlessness. The frustrations, the rejection, the denial of the ability to fulfill legitimate aspirations are compensated for among extreme advocates of black power by the posture and the delusional rhet-
oric of a power which is persistently denied them. This insight into the nature of this particular form of diversionary pseudo-power paradoxically led me into a more empathic understanding of the human pathos and psychological predicament of white racial extremists. Through my understanding and racial identification with compensatory black ex- tremists, I came to understand that whites who
awareness, evaluation, self-reflection, anxiety, re- flection on the past, and anticipation of the future. They are unique in that they make the human ego real—sometimes painfully real. They create and validate humanity, and they sustain the struggle for justice and decency in human relationship even as they provide the basis for rationalizing cruelties and inhumanity.
To make these abstractions real, these mysterious human cortical cells require a rather specific bio- chemical environment. They require that oxygen and nourishment be provided and regulated through an elaborate capillary system. The unstable equi- librium within and around these cells must be main- tained within a tolerable range of variation if the human ego and the complexities of function and continuity inherent in the sense of self are to be sustained.
The essence of the human predicament is the
man consciousness is the mysterious substances and the quality of interactions among the human corti- cal cells. All we seem to know about these cells is that they are unique among all of the combinations of matter and energy which are known to exist in
 1052 AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGIST
The normal functioning and the identity of the self can be disrupted through one or any combina- tion of disturbances within the internal environ- ment. Disruption in continuity of a personal iden- tity--loss of social and psychological continuity and existence—can occur in spite of the continuation of biological existence if there is any significant depri- vation in the specific biochemical requirements of these cortical cells. With such deprivation there can be changes in temperament and fundamental changes in the threshold of positive and negative responses or sensitivity to external environmental
forces.
Jn shorl, these cortical cells hold within them
the keys to the mystery of the definition and the functional quality of the self. They control by their ability to intensify, reduce, or obliterate the basic reality that is the self. And they are fragile. And it is upon the basis of their fragility that the human ego remains a fragile and delicate thing. To be human is not determined merely by the con- cretes of sensory functions, neural integration, and skeletal muscular behavior of the human organism. The essence of being human is defined by the nor- mal functioning of the uniquely complex human brain.
These insights are fraught with anxieties and probably should best be handled by denial or re- pression. Even before the ennui of youth became a fashionable topic of discussion, one of my students once suggested in a brilliant paper for my class in human motivation that the fundamental fear of man was the fear of confronting the void within. The sense of inner emptiness, a sense of limited experiential time, a sense of essential powerlessness, as the basic realities of the human experience—
these arc not tolerable insights. They must be compensated for with more positive, substantive concepts of self. Fortunately, the human brain that made this human predicament possible can also create, invent, or rationalize idcational substance up to and including indefinite continuity for the human ego.
The idea of the void within is abhorrent. The void must be filled. The creative activities of man —his religion, his philosophy, his art, hisliterature, his buildings, his cults, his cruelties, his science, his
objectifications of the inner turbulence of man. In proving to himself that his life is more than the continuous transformation of one form of biological and chemical energy into other forms of physical and behavioral energy, man seems compelled to mobilize and use psychological and social power constructively or destructively. The alternative would be to accept a level of desperation and stag- nation, indistinguishable from psychological death.
Among the paradoxes of the human predicament is that these disturbing insights, complicated as they are by the inevitability of evaluation inherent in the operation of human consciousness, demand that the human beings define human existence in terms greater than an interval between the acci- dents of conception and birth and the infinite noth- ingness of death. The mysterious power and forces which culminate in human consciousness insist that to be human is to be more than the awe- some and finite mystery of existential life. Human beings must affirm humanity and assert that there is purpose to and sacredness to human life despite
all threatening evidence to the contrary. This is the dynamic and the compensatory pathos of power. Affirmation in spite of—is the common denominator of human creativity and destructiveness; of human love and kindness and human hostility and cruelty; of human compassion and human egocentric postur- ing and bombast. It provides the basis for all that is sacred and barbaric in man.
In his discussion of the psychic fictions which arc essential in providing substance to human psy- chological existence, Adler stated in his Under- standing Human Nature:
We can realize how relative are the values of sensations, when not even these are absolute quantities; these elements of our psychic activity are influenced by the striving for a definite goal, our very perceptions are prejudiced by it, and are chosen, so to speak, with a secret hint at the final goal toward which the personality is striving.
We orient ourselves according to a fixed point which we have artificially created, which does not in reality exist, a fiction. This assumption is necessary because of the inade- quacy of our psychic life. . . . Tn the case of all psychic fictions we have to do with the following: we assume a fixed point even though closer observation forces us to ad- mit that it does not exist. The purpose of this assumption is simply to orient ourselves in the chaos of existence, so
that we can arrive at some apperception of relative values. The advantage is that we can categorize every sensation and every sentiment according to this fixed point, once we
technologies--are attemps to fill this void or to
obscure its existence. Human civilizations are have assumed it.
 These psychic fictions, these ideational inventions and objective creations of man which constitute his culture and civilizations, ordinarily seem sufficient to quell temporarily the incipient anguish of the imminence of nonbeing. They frequently postpone the ultimate embarrassment of the acceptance of personal and collective nonimportance.
Of all the compensatory protective agents in- vented or created by the human brain as a cushion against the intolerable realities of human flimsiness, probably the most flexible and effective has been the idea of God. Man has invested God with both omnipotence and permanence. An analysis of the characteristics of God, the powers and functions of God, betrays the pathos and the vulnerability of man. One of the most important functions of God is that of protecting man against accepting and coming to terms with the realities of human limi- tations. In a most literal and basic psychological sense, God is the primary source of power for man. Man created God to create man with introjective strengths, with solidity, and with purpose and sub- stance. To perform this awesome and important task there must be an ideationally literal God. If for no other reason, therefore, God is not only not dead, man cannot permit God to die. If God were to die, human beings would have to die psychologi- cally, even though alive as organisms.
The importance of God as a protection against the fragility of the human ego is revealed in the demigods, the directly observable gods, created by the human mind and also invested with protective power. Magicians, medicine men, priests, bishops, kings, generals, father figures, movie stars, all serve similar if not identical divine functions. These charismatic figures, these personifications of power, are anointed and given virtues and powers beyond those found in ordinary men. Through identifica- tion with them and their projected power, the average man can obscure his weaknesses and affirm his ego. These human gods sometimes internalize the god-like powers attributed to them. They soon believe and act as if they are gods—or are required to engage in a continuous struggle against this tantalizing temptation. From this point of view, paradox emerges as the major characteristic or quality of a bemused God—a God of the inescap- able practical joke of the human predicament.
A similar protective and power brokerage func- tion is played by the variety of groups that human
beings have invented and emotionally identified with. Tribes, cults, religions, nations, and their coercive and protective dogmas and ideologies may be seen as group gods, which bestow substance and strengths upon otherwise vulnerable individuals. The strength and power of a group seem directly proportional to the degree to which it can compen- sate for the fragility or obscure the insignificance and pathos of its individual members. These group benefits appear to be enhanced by the group's dem-
onstrated ability to exercise power over and inflict cruelty upon other groups of human beings.
SOCIAL POWER: A STRUGGLE FOR INTEGRATION FOR ORGANISMIC AND SOCIAL SYSTEMS
There is the tendency among many of us who are concerned with studying more systematically the crucial role of social power in human affairs to present our case as if power is the only significant motivational force and as if it can operate in isola- tion from the total complexity of structure and integrated functions of organismic and social sys- tems.
A realistic view of social power requires that it be seen as a pervasive and integrative force, oper- ating in relationship to other forces in the dynamic constellation of the human personality.
Personality is defined here as the characteristic way in which the individual human organism mo- bilizes and uses all of its available resources in its struggle for survival, satisfaction, status, meaning, and moral integrity.
This definition suggests a hierarchy of the moti- vational components of personality: in this hier- archy, power or status needs fall midway between the more primitive drives toward survival and sensual satisfactions and the uniquely human mo- tives of the quest for meaning and moral integrity. Power may, therefore, operate toward either end of the motivational continuum to reinforce or make dominant either the primitive or the human pro- pensities of man. Power may make stark and rigid, or determine fixation on or regression to, one or another of the other motivational levels; and it may determine the pattern of relationship among the motivational levels. It can also intensify, ob- scure, or contaminate one or more of them as they function in the dynamic system of interaction which is the totality of the personality. Power

and status needs can determine whether other needs will be gratified in animalistic, egocentric, or non- adaptive ways or in human, empathic, and socially constructive channels.
This is the dilemma of power from whence the pathos of power arises.
CONTEMPORARY CRISES OF THE PATHOS OF POWER
Power cannot be exercised without inducing some form of reaction or counterreaction. Social power in its manifest forms, therefore, almost always in- volves confrontations and conflicts; and generally results in either accommodation, with or without residual resentment; or in acute defiance, sporadic counterreaction, or prolonged and smoldering re- sistance. This is the psychodynamic base for the cycle of power: reaction to power and counter- reaction.
The rewards of the exercise of power are transi- tory, and the gratifications of power and status needs are frequently nonadaptive and self-defeating. The following arc some specific symptoms of the nonadaptive pathos, futility, of power.
1. When the exercise of power does not, in fact, increase or when it interferes with the chances of gratifying the more basic needs of survival and satisfaction.
2. When the exercise of power is ambiguous, ran- dom, arbitrary, regressive, disproportionately in- tense and rigid in spite of consequences.
3. When the exercise of power becomes so func- tionally autonomous and extreme in its intensity as to subvert and pervert the critical, rational, and moral capacities of individuals and groups.
4. When the attainment of the symbols of power or the unchallenged actuality of power results in a sense of futility and ennui and the dissipation of the desire or the capacity to use power construc- tively or creatively.
The continuation, intensification, and cumulative effect of any combination of these symptoms are major threats to the organism or the social system. This crisis betrays the fact that the power system has become self-directing and is no longer being controlled by the organism and social system in terms of their adaptive needs. The survival of the system would then seem to depend on its capacity to redirect the power drives and channel their energy toward constructive ends within the im- perative period of time.
Certainly, the normal brain has the necessary survival alert systems which ordinarily can be put into operation to prevent the organism from pur- suing rigidly the paths of self-destruction. Whether the brain of man can provide the basis for resolv- ing the contemporary survival crises of social power positively and constructively remains a mat- ter of conjecture. It is a mocking fact that the human brain can provide intellectual and moral rationalizations for a nonadaptive, ultimately de- structive use of social power. It can invent ideational, delusional realities that provide the crutches for the fragile human ego. It can justify human pomp and pretense as a myriad of non- rational forces propels man toward disaster. But the human brain is also the only source of positive alternatives—alternatives to personal anxieties, hu- miliations, intergroup tensions, violence—alterna- tives to suicide, homicide, and the barbarities of war.
Contemporary man's technological mastery of matter and energy, and the related ultimate thermo- nuclear weaponry, confronts us with the fact that it is now possible to destroy the human species through the nonadaptive use of human intelligence and the destructive, pathetic use of social power. This threat is so ultimate and so urgent that it is understandable that human beings would seek to deny or repress it in order to continue to function as if it did not exist. But it does exist. And it must be handled if human beings are to be able to function without the gnawing and debilitating anxieties inherent in the imminence of extinction.
This survival crisis requires immediate mobiliza- tion of all that is positive within man to provide us with the time necessary to prevent man from destroying the human species—and to provide man with the time required to evolve and to develop a more stable organismic base for the rational and moral exercise of social power.
ERA OF PSYCHOTECHNOLOGY
The present generation of human beings is re- quired to develop psychological and social sciences with that degree of precision, predictability, and moral control essential to the survival of man. The awesome advances in the physical and biologi- cal sciences have made psychotechnology impera- tive. Man can no longer afford the luxuries of a leisurely, trial-and-error, trivia-dominated approach
 THE PATHOS OF POWEE 1055
to the behavioral sciences. The behavioral sciences results but that they require continuous reinforce-
are now the critical sciences; they will determine the answer to the ultimate moral question of human survival.
Given the urgency of this immediate survival problem, the psychological and social sciences must enable us to control the animalistic, barbaric, and primitive propensities in man and subordinate these negatives to the uniquely human moral and ethical characteristics of love, kindness, and empathy.
The redirecting of power away from the absurd, the pathetic, and the self-defeating can be and now must be seen as a responsibility and goal of science and psychotechnology. We can no longer afford to rely solely on the traditional, prescientific attempts to contain human cruelty and destructiveness. The techniques and appeals of religion, moral philos- ophy, law, and education seemed appropriate and civilized approaches to the control of man's prim- itive and egocentric behavior in a prenuclear age. They are, in themselves, no longer appropriate because they permit too wide a margin of error and a degree of unpredictability that is rationally in- consistent with the present survival urgency. Fur-
thermore, moral verbalizations of the past have been prostituted by the pathos of power; they have been perverted by the pretenses of rationality in the service of inhumanity if not barbarity.
The traditional perspective and training of psy- chologists, educators, and moral philosophers would lead them to continue to argue that moral controls of human primitive and egocentric impulses be sought by redoubling our efforts in developing more effective forms of moral education designed to pro- duce individual human beings with ethical autonomy and integrity. They would argue that it is still possible to preserve human civilization by training human beings toward a higher quality of inter- personal relationships; by developing within indi- vidual human beings greater personal and social effectiveness through greater ego strengths. They would continue to assert that a variety of be- havioral modification techniques, imposed particu- larly in childhood, could be expected to reinforce altruism, empathy, and group commitment and sub- ordinate egocentricity in normal human beings.
An objective appraisal of the results of these approaches to a control of the negatives in man and the enhancement of his positives would seem to suggest that not only are they unpredictable in
ment and a prolonged period of time in order to demonstrate positive results. We do not now appear to have the amount of time which these techniques require for hoped-for success.
This present era of psychotechnology comes with the abrupt recognition of this fact of a very limited time within which the human brain can obtain and use that knowledge required to control, protest, and affirm humanity with precision and predictability. Already there are many provocative and suggestive findings from neurophysiological, biochemical, and psychopharmacological and psychological research. The work on the effects of direct stimulation of certain areas of the brain; the role of specific areas of the midbrain in controlling certain affects; the effects of certain drugs on exciting, tranquilizing, or depressing the emotional and motivational levels of the individual; and the effects of externally in- duced behavioral changes on internal biochemistry of the organism suggest that we might be on the threshold of that type of scientific biochemical in- tervention which could stabilize and make dominant the moral and ethical propensities of man and subordinate, if not eliminate, his negative and primitive behavioral tendencies.
On the basis of the presently available evidence, it is reasonable to believe that this type of precise, direct psychotechnological intervention geared to- ward strengthening man's moral and positive human characteristics could be obtained and implemented within a few years, and with a fraction of the cost required to produce the atom bomb; and much less than the present cost of our explorations in outer space.
It is here being suggested that with the mobiliza- tion of the necessary scientific personnel, financial resources, and research facilities, it is now possible —indeed, imperative—to reduce human anxieties, tensions, hostilities, violence, cruelty, and the de- structive power irrationalities of man which are the basis of wars. This contemporary approach to assuring the survival of the human species offers a scientific basis for William James' philosophical wish for a moral equivalence or alternative to wars.
In reducing the negatives and enhancing the posi- tive potentials in human beings, in addition to the political organizational and administrative problems to be resolved, there would be a number of im- portant psychological barriers to be faced and
 1056 AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGIST
solved with realism and clue regard lor that essen- tial humanity which differentiates human beings from mere organisms or living machines. The process and techniques of direct biochemical inter- vention or any form of effective psychotechnology must take into account the totality, the inter- relatedncss, the complex gestalt of the human moti- vational, affective, and cognitive system. Jn seek- ing to enhance the positives of empathy and kind- ness and reduce the cruel and the barbaric in man, psychotechnology must not destroy the creative, evaluative, and selective capacities of human beings. Without the desire to explore, to reorganize things and ideas, to vary moods, and to produce, at least with the illusions of flexibility and volition, the human being would indeed be an empty organic vessel and it would be difficult to justify the mere fact of survival under these conditions. In addition to precision and predictability, this suggested psy- chotechnological intervention into human affairs must be affirmatively humane. An inviolable sense of moral responsibility is the essential new in- gredient which this new era of the psychological sciences must bring to the contemporary require- ments of science.
The implications of a precise and predictable psychotechnological intervention into the whole arena of human interaction are of such vast im- portance as to demand that the most careful and rigorous planning, research, and testing precede any attempts to apply these findings on a larger scale. Because these are uniquely human problems with which this program is concerned, the pretest sub- jects would have to be human beings. The impli- cations of an effective psychotechnology for the con- trol of criminal behavior and the amelioration of the moral insensitivities which produce reactive criminality in others arc clear. It would seem, therefore, that there would be moral and rational justification for the use of compulsive criminals as pretest subjects in seeking precise forms of inter- vention and moral control of human behavior. This suggestion is based on the assumption that no human being who is not impelled by some forms of internal, biochemical or external, social forces—or some combination of both—would choose to be a
criminal if he were provided with options.
It is a fact that a few men in the leadership positions in the industrialized nations of the world now have the power to determine among them-
selves, through collaboration or competition, the survival or extinction of human civilization. They can, in fact, exercise this power only within the present limitations of the pathos and contradictions of power for temporary good or unpredictable ulti- mate evil. There is no way of predicting the personal and emotional stability of these leaders with the life and death power over mankind. Nor do we now know the relationship between those personal characteristics which are related to suc- cess in obtaining positions of political and govern- mental power on the one hand and the degree of personal, emotional, and moral stability on the other hand. The masses of human beings are now required to live and continue to work on faith, hope, denial, and the acceptance of the chances that their powerful leaders will have the strength to use their power wisely and morally.
Given these contemporary facts, it would seem logical that a requirement imposed on all power- controlling leaders—and those who aspire to such leadership—would be that they accept and use the earliest perfected form of psychotechnological, bio- chemical intervention which would assure their positive use of power and reduce or block the possibility of their using power destructively. This form of psychotechnological medication would be a type of internally imposed disarmament. It would assure that there would be no absurd or barbaric use of power. It would provide the masses of human beings with the security that their leaders would not or could not sacrifice them on the altars of their personal ego pathos, vulnerability—and in- stability.
It is possible to object to the era of psycho- technology on "moral" grounds and to assert that these suggestions are repugnant because they are manipulative and will take away from man his natural right to make errors—even those errors which perpetrate cruelties and destruction upon other human beings. In the light of the realities of and possible consequences of nuclear weaponry, these allegedly moral arguments seem mockingly, pathetically immoral. It would seem that man could afford to indulge in this type of abstract, pre- scientific moralizing in the past when his most destructive weapons were clubs, bow and arrows, or even gunpowder. To continue this type of thinking in an age when nuclear weapons are capable of destroying millions of human beings in a single
 irrational man-made event would seem to be a form of self-defeating and immoral rigidity.
There could be the further objection that bio- chemical intervention into the inner psychological recesses of motivation, temperament, and behavior of human beings is an unacceptable, intolerable tampering with the natural or God-given character- istics of man. The negative connotations presently associated with discussions of drugs and the drug culture, particularly among young people, could be invoked to support this objection. One could also object on the ground that, in effect, what is here being suggested under the guise of an imperative psychotechnology is just another form of Utopian mechanization of human beings through drugging the masses and their leaders.
These objections seem to be based on semantic grounds rather than on essential substance. In medicine, physical diseases are controlled through medication. Medicines are prescribed by doctors to help the body overcome the detrimental effects of bacteria or viruses—or to help the organism restore that balance of internal biochemical environment necessary for health and effectiveness. Medicines are not only used to treat the diseases of individ-
uals, but arc also used preventively in the form of vaccines. All medicines are drugs—and all drugs used therapeutically are forms of intervention to influence and control the natural processes of dis- ease. Selective and appropriate medication to as- sure psychological health and moral integrity is now imperative for the survival of human society.
The era of psychotechnology, having been im- posed upon man by the physical scientific advances of man, cannot now be avoided. It must be used affirmatively, wisely, and with com- passion. To fulfill these requirements, it must have a sound scientific, factual base. It must also be firmly rooted in rational morality. It must respect and enhance that which is uniquely human in man—those positive qualities which promise a fu- ture of human grandeur. In meeting these and related requirements, a rigorous, tough-minded sci- ence and technology of psychology will save man from the more destructive consequences of his absurdities and propensities—the pathos of power— and will provide him with the time necessary to evolve and stabilize those centers of his brain which will make social morality and human survival no longer a matter of chance.

We often make judgments about the behavior of other people, determining whether particular acts were or were not appropriate. Occasionallywe may even decide, based on our observations, *rat someone is "mentally ill." This exercise offers a classroom opportunity to study such attributions.
Ask for six volunteers to play roles in a skit. Take them out of the room and have them choose a role from six 3 x 5 inch cards bearing the following descriptions:
1. You are an escaped convict, previously convicted of murder. 2. You are a successful business executive whose spouse just
announced the existence of a love affair, whose child is in the hospital, and whose car broke down this moming.
3. You are married with two children and unemployed; you desperately need a job and are on your way to an interview.
4. You are on yourway to a sale.
5. You are lonely, have few friends, became bored watching TV, and are going somewhere just to have something to do.
6. You are waiting at the bus stop for the bus. Your role is to try to engage each of the waiting passengers in conversation so that the class can observe how they act. Some questions that you might ask are: Do you have the proper time? Does the bus usually run late?
While the actors study their roles, return to the room and instnrct the other students to observe closely the behavior of each actor. Bring in tlre actor who drew the sixth role-the catalyst. Then bring in the other actors one by one, and let them interact with the catalyst for about 1 minute each.
When the skit is over, have the actors return to their seats. On the chalkboard, set up a matrix with the names of the actors in a vertical column on the left; list them in any order, except put tlre catalyst's name last. Tell the class that the six actors were playing rolds, that you are going to list those roles across the top of tlre matrix, and tJlat you are going to poll the class to determine how many believe each actor could have been piaying each role. AIso tell them that you are going to include a role that no one played. Then list the roles one at a tjme, polling students on each one before you list the next. List the roles in the same order as they appear above, but insert "a mentally ill person" between the third and fourth roles.

 Discussion
Whenthe votingis completed, examine the data. First, determine
which actors appeared to play several roles and which were identified
with only one role. Next, determine which roles were cleady identified
and which appeared to be played by many actors. Then ask tiee actors to
state which role they played. It will become apparent that no one was
assigned tlre role of "a mentally ill person." Now check how many
believed each of the six actors to be playing that role. compare the total
number here to totals for other roles. usually the total for "a mentally ill A personi' is one of the highest.
This c outcome can lead to a discussion of how easy it is for people to be

labeled mentally ill when there is no psychological problem present. Ask the students to verbalize what behaviors tlrey observed in the actors that they felt were indicative of mental illness. Is there any agreement on those behaviors? Were those behaviors exhibited by actors who were not thought to be mentally ill? You can add a number of topics to tJre discussion such as witch hunts and the legal definition of insanity. you can also discuss tlre concept of mental ilLress. Does the use of tlre term

            <Title>Other rules</Title>
            <Text>#### Special Rules
If possible, each player must serve on at least one committee at some point during the game.

##### Writing Tasks	
Every player will write and present at least once during the course of the game. Your role sheet should specify the specific tasks you need to complete.

A special note for data-driven writing tasks: don't say 'studies have shown that' or (in the 1st person) 'I have shown that...', show it. That will probably mean that you will have to go to the library, find the original research reports of your character, and familiarize yourself with the basic research design, as well as the relationship between the evidence presented and the thesis that evidence is reported to support. If that sounds like a great deal of effort, it should. Above all, remember that you're not writing a report on this person or position, you are playing the person and defending the position.  So don't write about  what you (as the character) believe, write as if you believe it.

##### Proposals

Proposals should be formal. They should be distributed to the membership at least 24 hours before a vote is called. It is usually sufficient to distribute proposals during the first session of a conference year, and hold a vote during the second (or third). Ample time for discussion should be allotted for each proposal.

Formal proposals begin by laying out the reasons for the proposal with a series of 'WHEREAS...' clauses.  It should then state the resolution. For example, in 1969, the APA resolved:

&gt;*WHEREAS* in many state legislature, bills have recently been introduced for the purpose of repealing or drastically modifying the existing criminal codes with respect to the termination of unwanted pregnancies;

&gt;and *WHEREAS* termination of unwanted pregnancies is clearly a mental health and child welfare issue, and a legitimate concern of APA;

&gt; *BE IT RESOLVED* that termination of pregnancy be considered a civil right of the pregnant woman, to be handled as other medical and surgical procedures in consultation with her physician, and to be considered legal if performed by a licensed physician in a licensed medical facility.

You should follow this format when drafting your proposals. Proposals in the incorrect format cannot be distributed.

##### Papers and Symposia
Academic conferences are opportunities to disseminate information you have gathered for your views. The method of presenting those ideas or that data, however, can vary a great deal.  The APA currently supports two kinds of presentations: Individual Reports and Symposia. The Program Committee (see below) is encouraged to experiment with new kinds of presentations, including posters, round tables, workshops, and even exhibits, if they choose. Individual Reports are talks given by a single researcher or group of researchers. Symposia are 'panel' presentations, where a group of presentations are offered on a theme or a specific problem.

The Program Committee reviews all proposals for both individual reports and symposia.  The guidelines for proposing a report are included in the official 'Call for Papers and Symposia', which follows on page 12.
##### Research Grants

Research grants are 1-2 page proposals specifying a research project you'd like to carry out.  These are submitted to the Research committee (see p. 7) and follow the form specified in the Call for Research Grants', which follows on page 17. If you win a research grant, you will be expected to present your findings at the next annual conference.

##### Reading aloud
Presentations at academic conferences are evaluated by peers primarily on the basis of the content presented, not the style of presentation. While it is important to practice good public speaking skills-making eye contact with the audience, modulating one's voice, etc.—getting the data right is more important than being entertaining. For that reason, this game will allow 'reading' of some experimental reports.  Experimental reports highlight the data presented, and carefully articulate the structure of the experiment performed. It is also advisable to bring handouts for the membership when presenting data.

Presidential addresses, however, should be carefully crafted general lectures. These should appeal to the membership of the APA, which includes many individuals from a variety of backgrounds. They should also be understandable by the general public, as the President is often seen as a spokesperson and advocate for the discipline.

Symposia and presentations to the committees, however, must be delivered without a transcript. Cue cards or notes are allowed, but in these cases, the speaker must strive to make a personal connection with the audience, and hence, must not simply read a prepared speech.</Text>

Obituary for Harry Frederick Harlow (1905-1981). Harlow's research career, spanning a full half century, was notable for its single-minded adherence to the search for understanding of a single species, for the imaginative methods he devised for the study of both cognition and motivation, and for the crucially important findings these methods provided. His careful empirical development of the facts of behavioral development led to prepositional generalizations that have contributed notably to an understanding of human as well as monkey motivational development.

This activity is a good "opener" to get students to pay attention and talk. The materials are readily available, and once you have them, there is no advance prepiiation. The music from the movie )aws could be replaced by music from any currcntthriller, with appropriate modifications in imagery. No prior knowledge of psychol- ogy is necessary, and the activity is suitable for classes of all sizes.

The concept of classical conditioning is often difficult for students to grasp if the instructor immediately begins to use the time-honored example of Pavlov and his dogs. The students may get lost in the maze of terms-Us, UR, CR, CS-and fail to see any relevance between slobbering dogs and human leaming. Thus I think that it is important to begin a presentation of classical conditioning with a real-life example that most students have experienced.
You will need a tape recording of a few seconds of the shark-attack music from the movie /aws.
I use this demonstration at the beginning of the section on conditioning in general psychology classes before I introduce the concepts. First I ask students to close their eyes and engage in mental imagery. I tell them to imagine that it is a hot summer day and that they are at the beach. The sun is scorching. They are getting hotter and hotter, can stand it no longer, run toward the ocean, and splash in the shallow water. Then they swim out to deeper water and enjoy cooling off after being in the sun. It is fairly easy to stretch this imagery process out for 2 or 3 minutes. Then, as unobtrusively as possible, I start the music ftom [aws. From the expressions on their faces and the laughter, I can tell immediately that most students have seen /aws and have been conditioned to associate the killer shark with the music.
The key part of the demonstration is the discussion that follows. Without knowing the appropriate classical conditioning terms/ students are able to explain in their own words what happened during the movie. They can tell you that the shark (technically a CS, but a US in this demonstration) yields a response of fear or disgust (the UR). They know that the music (CS) originally had no meaning but came to elicit a response (CR) during the movie because it signaled that the shark was about to appear and have a swimmer for lunch. At this point, they are prepared to hear your discussion on Pav-

lov's experiment, to understand it and the terminology used and to see the application of classical conditioning to human behavior. As you go on tJrrough the classical con- ditioning information/ youran point out that you actually demonstrated second-order conditioning to $-rem, because their responses to a shark are leamed through classical conditioning since they associate sharks with mutilation, blood, death, and so forth. All in all, the demonstration helps to bring classical conditioning and its principles to life in a highly relevant situati,on.
