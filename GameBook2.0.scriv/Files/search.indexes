            <Text>### Main Factions

Players represent three factions with different perspectives on not only the nature of scientific inquiry into the human mind, but the object of those studies themselves.  A number of independents, representing a variety of academic disciplines, complement these three factions.

It should be noted that unlike some other reacting games, individuals in these factions are not bound to think or vote the same way on the central issues in the game. The factions represent high-level agreement on the nature of the science of the mind, there is almost complete disagreement on all other issues. In fact, when it comes to actual game play, you might find that your votes are more aligned with members of other factions than your own.</Text>

            <Text>#### Ethics of human research

Ethical codes of research have generally followed the discovery or publication of horrifically unethical experiments.  The most famous of these is probably the Nuremberg Code, adopted by the international medical community after the discovery of the Nazi 'experiments' performed on Jews, Homosexuals and Gypsies during the Holocaust.  The Nuremberg code is available online, and should be reviewed by anyone proposing an experiment or sitting on the Research Committee. See http://www.ushmm.org/research/doctors/Nuremberg_Code.htm.

##### The Nuremberg Code

The Nuremberg code lays out ten simple principles for design experiments on humans. They are:


&lt;!--\begin{apatextbox}{The Nuremberg Code} 

\rowgroup{1.	The voluntary consent of the human subject is absolutely essential. This means that the person involved should have legal capacity to give consent; should be so situated as to be able to exercise free power of choice, without the intervention of any element of force, fraud, deceit, duress, overreaching, or other ulterior form of constraint or coercion; and should have sufficient knowledge and comprehension of the elements of the subject matter involved as to enable him to make an understanding and enlightened decision. This latter element requires that before the acceptance of an affirmative decision by the experimental subject there should be made known to him the nature, duration, and purpose of the experiment; the method and means by which it is to be conducted; all inconveniences and hazards reasonably to be expected; and the effects upon his health or person which may possibly come from his participation in the experiment.\newline

The duty and responsibility for ascertaining the quality of the consent rests upon each individual who initiates, directs, or engages in the experiment. It is a personal duty and responsibility which may not be delegated to another with impunity.}\\

\rowgroup{2.	The experiment should be such as to yield fruitful results for the good of society, unprocurable by other methods of means of study, and not random and unnecessary in nature.}\\

\rowgroup{3.	The experiment should be so designed and based on the results of animal experimentation and a knowledge of the natural history of the disease or other problem under study that the anticipated results will justify the performance of the experiment. }\\

\rowgroup{4.	The experiment should be so conducted as to avoid all unnecessary physical and mental suffering and injury.}\\

\rowgroup{5.	No experiment should be conducted where there is an a priori reason to believe that death or disabling injury will occur; except, perhaps, in those experiments where the experimental physicians also serve as subjects.}\\

\rowgroup{6.	The degree of risk to be taken should never exceed that determined by the humanitarian importance of the problem to be solved by the experiment. }\\

\rowgroup{7.	Proper preparations should be made and adequate facilities provided to protect the experimental subject against even remote possibilities of injury, disability or death.}\\

\rowgroup{8.	The experiment should be conducted only by scientifically qualified persons. The highest degree of skill and care should be required though all stages of the experiment of those who conduct or engage in the experiment. }\\

\rowgroup{9.	During the course of the experiment the human subject should be at liberty to bring the experiment to an end if he has reached the physical or mental state where continuation of the experiment seems to him to be impossible.}\\

\rowgroup{10.	During the course of the experiment the scientist in charge must be prepared to terminate the experiment at any stage, if he has probable cause to believe, in the exercise of the good faith, superior skill and careful judgment required of him that a continuation of the experiment is likely to result in injury, disability or death to the experimental subject. }\\

##### The Declaration of Helsinki

In 1964, the medical community through the World Medical Association adopted the 'Declaration of Helsinki', which replaced the Nuremberg code as the standard for ethical experimentation on humans by the medical community. The World Medical Association still maintains the Declaration, adopting the most recent revisions in 2004. It is available online (http://www.wma.net/e/policy/b3.htm).

Psychiatrists, as practicing medical doctors, are bound by the Declaration of Helsinki. While it is far more complete than the Nuremberg code, the same basic ideas appear:

&lt;!--\begin{apatextbox}{The Declaration of Helsinki}
\label{sample:helsinki} 


I. Basic Principles \\

\rowgroup{1. Biomedical research involving human subjects must conform to generally accepted scientific principles and should be based on adequately performed laboratory and animal experimentation and on a thorough knowledge of the scientific literature. }\\

\rowgroup{2. The design and performance of each experimental procedure involving human subjects should be clearly formulated in an experimental protocol which should be transmitted to a specially appointed independent committee for consideration, comment and guidance. }\\

\rowgroup{3. Biomedical research involving human subjects should be conducted only by scientifically qualified persons and under the supervision of a clinically competent medical person. The responsibility for the human subject must always rest with a medically qualified person and never rest on the subject of the research, even though the subject has given his or her consent. }\\

\rowgroup{4. Biomedical research involving human subjects cannot legitimately be carried out unless the importance of the objective is in proportion to the inherent risk to the subject. }\\

\rowgroup{5. Every biomedical research project involving human subjects should be preceded by careful assessment of predictable risks in comparison with foreseeable benefits to the subject or to others. Concern for the interests of the subject must always prevail over the interests of science and society. }\\

\rowgroup{6. The right of the research subject to safeguard his or her integrity must always be respected. Every precaution should be taken to respect the privacy of the subject and to minimize the impact of the study on the subject's physical and mental integrity and on the personality of the subject. }\\

\rowgroup{7. Physicians should abstain from engaging in research projects involving human subjects unless they are satisfied that the hazards involved are believed to be predictable. Physicians should cease any investigation if the hazards are found to outweigh the potential benefits. }\\

\rowgroup{8. In publication of the results of his or her research, the physician is obliged to preserve the accuracy of the results. Reports of experimentation not in accordance with the principles laid down in this Declaration should not be accepted for publication. }\\

\rowgroup{9. In any research on human beings, each potential subject must be adequately informed of the aims, methods, anticipated benefits and potential hazards of the study and the discomfort it may entail. He or she should be informed that he or she is at liberty to abstain from participation in the study and that he or she is free to withdraw visor her consent to participation at any time. The physician should then obtain the subject's freely given informed consent, preferably inheriting.} \\

\rowgroup{10. When obtaining informed consent for the research project the physician should be particularly cautious if the subject is in dependent relationship to him or her or may consent under duress. In that case the informed consent should be obtained by a physician who isn't engaged in the investigation and who is completely independent of this official relationship. }\\

\rowgroup{11. In case of legal incompetence, informed consent should be obtained from the legal guardian in accordance with national legislation. Where physical or mental incapacity makes it impossible to obtain informed consent, or when the subject is a minor, permission from the responsible relative replaces that of the subject in accordance with national legislation. Whenever the minor child is in fact able to give a consent, the minor's consent must be obtained in addition to the consent of the minor's legal guardian. }\\

\rowgroup{12. The research protocol should always contain a statement of the ethical considerations involved and should indicate that the principles enunciated in the present declaration are complied with. }\\

II. Medical Research Combined with Professional Care (Clinical Research) \\

\rowgroup{1. In the treatment of the sick person, the physician must be free to use a new diagnostic and therapeutic measure, if in his or her judgement it offers hope of saving life, re-establishing health or alleviating suffering. }\\

\rowgroup{2. The potential benefits, hazards and discomfort of a new method should be weighed against the advantages of the best current diagnostic and therapeutic methods. }\\

\rowgroup{3. In any medical study, every patient- including those of a control group, if any- should be assured of the best proven diagnostic and therapeutic method. }\\

\rowgroup{4. The refusal of the patient to participate in a study must never interfere with the physician-patient relationship. }\\

\rowgroup{5. If the physician considers it essential not to obtain informed consent, the specific reasons for this proposal should be stated in the experimental protocol for transmission to the independent committee (1, 2). }\\

\rowgroup{6. The physician can combine medical research with professional care, the objective being the acquisition of new medical knowledge, only to the extent that medical research is justified by its potential diagnostic or therapeutic  value for the patient. }\\

III. Non-Therapeutic Biomedical Research Involving Human Subjects (Non-Clinical Biomedical Research) \\

\rowgroup{1. In the purely scientific application of medical research carried out on a human being, it is the duty of the physician to remain the protector of the life and health of that person on whom biomedical research is being carried out. }\\

\rowgroup{2. The subjects should be volunteers- either healthy persons or patients for whom the experimental design is not related to the patient's illness. }\\

\rowgroup{3. The investigator or the investigating team should discontinue the research if in his/her or their judgment it may, if continued, be harmful to the individual. }\\

\rowgroup{4.	In research on man, the interest of science and society should never take precedence over considerations related to the well-being of the subject. }\\

 \end{apatextbox}--&gt; 



In the context of psychiatry, of course, the distinction made between therapeutic research and non-therapeutic research is crucially important.  If a psychiatric patient were to be deemed incapable of making an informed decision, and there is an experiment therapy that the psychiatrist believes may help, there are few ethical checks and balances to constrain the psychiatrist from performing unwarranted experiments.

##### The APA Ethical Standards for Psychologists

The APA Standards were first published in 1953. They were revised in 1959, 1963 and 1968. The 1968 standards, which should guide the research committee in determining which research programs should be allowed to move forward, are attached in &lt;!--\fullref{app: APAEthics}--&gt;.

Most of the APA standards outline the responsibilities of psychologists who practice counseling and patient care.  While those are incredibly important, we're most concerned here with Principle 16: Research Precautions.  In 1959, section 16 was titled 'Harmful Aftereffect.' It read:

&lt;!--\begin{apatextbox}{APA Ethical Standards: 1959}\label{sample:APAEthics1959}
\newthought{Principle 16. Harmful Aftereffects}. Only when a problem is significant and can be investigated in no other way is the psychologist justified in giving misinformation to research subjects or exposing research subjects to physical or emotional stress.\\

\rowgroup{a. When the possibility of serious aftereffects exists, research is conducted only when the subjects or the responsible agents are fully informed of this possibility and volunteer nevertheless.}\\

\rowgroup{b. The psychologist seriously considers the possibility harmful aftereffects and removes them as soon as permitted by the design of the experiment.}\\

\rowgroup{c. A psychologist using animals in research adheres to the provisions of the Rules Regarding Animals, drawn up by the Committee on Precautions in Animal Experimentation and adopted by the American Psychological Association.}\\
\end{apatextbox}--&gt;

Four years later, in 1963, the committee responsible for the Ethical guidelines moved the 'preamble' into a numbered point 

&lt;!--\rowgroup{a. changed the title to 'Research Precautions' and added a new preamble. It also changed the phrase 'is significant' to 'is of scientific significance'; ' can be investigated in no other way' became ' it is not practicable to investigate it in any other way'; ' giving misinformation to research subjects' was dropped; and the phrase 'whether children or adults' added to the new point (a). }

\rowgroup{b. added the qualification of  'reasonable' to 'possibility'; changed 'harmful' to 'injurious' and 'volunteer' became 'agree to participate'.  }

\rowgroup{c. changed 'removes' to 'avoids or removes'; and }

\rowgroup{d. were unchanged: (changes italicized)} --&gt;

&lt;!--\begin{apatextbox}{APA Ethical standards 1963}
\label{sample: APAEthics1963}
\newthought{Principle 16. Research Precautions.} The psychologist assumes obligations for the welfare of his research subjects, both animal and human.\\

\rowgroup{a. Only when a problem is of scientific significance and it is not practicable to investigate it in any other way is the psychologist justified in exposing research subjects research subjects, whether children or adults, to physical or emotional stress.}\\

\rowgroup{b. When the possibility of injurious aftereffects exists, research is conducted only when the subjects or the responsible agents are fully informed of this possibility and agree to participate nevertheless.}\\

\rowgroup{c. The psychologist seriously considers the possibility harmful aftereffects and avoids or removes them as soon as permitted by the design of the experiment.}\\

\rowgroup{d. A psychologist using animals in research adheres to the provisions of the Rules Regarding Animals, drawn up by the Committee on Precautions in Animal Experimentation and adopted by the American Psychological Association.} \\
\end{apatextbox}--&gt;

 These changed little between 1963 and 1968, except for the addition of  the qualifying phrase 'as part of the investigation' to (a) and adding provision (e) governing the use of psychoactive drugs:


&lt;!--

\begin{apatextbox}{APA Ethical standards 1968}
\label{sample: APAEthics1968}
\newthought{Principle 16. Research Precautions.} The psychologist assumes obligations for the welfare of his research subjects, both animal and human.\\

\rowgroup{a. Only when a problem is of scientific significance and it is not practicable to investigate it in any other way is the psychologist justified in exposing research subjects research subjects, whether children or adults, to physical or emotional stress as part of an investigation.}\\
\rowgroup{b. When the possibility of injurious aftereffects exists, research is conducted only when the subjects or the responsible agents are fully informed of this possibility and agree to participate nevertheless.}\\
\rowgroup{c. The psychologist seriously considers the possibility harmful aftereffects and avoids, or removes them as soon as permitted by the design of the experiment.}\\
\rowgroup{d. A psychologist using animals in research adheres to the provisions of the Rules Regarding Animals, drawn up by the Committee on Precautions in Animal Experimentation and adopted by the American Psychological Association.}\\
\rowgroup{e. Investigations of human subjects using experimental drugs (for example, hallucinogenic, psychotomimetic, psychedelic, or similar substances) should be conducted only in such settings as clinics, hospitals, or research facilities maintaining appropriate safeguards for the subjects.}\\

### Brief history of the concept of 'Psychology'

Psychology is probably the youngest of commonly accepted academic disciplines---the first PhD in Psychology was earned by G. Stanley Hall in 1878. But we'll get to that. First, we have to go back to the notion of science itself.

#### Pre-history of Psychology: Empiricism about the Mind

The scientific investigation into the human mind and/or human behavior begins almost simultaneously with science itself.  Our inquiry into its history must then begin with the followers of Francis Bacon, who created the ‘scientific method’ and trace the idea that the can be studied scientifically through the rise of the empiricists into the present day. All citations for Bacon are to [#Bacon:1620ui].

Bacon, who we now credit with establishing 'The Scientific Method,' argued that the human mind tended to distort reality in regular, systematic ways, which he called 'idols.' In order to understand reality, we must then give up on the idea that a single person can discover the truth on his or her own.

 In order to learn about the world, we need to work together, collaboratively creating a “natural and experimental history” (Bk 2, Ch X, p 109) of the phenomenon.  As working collaboratively can lead to confusion and misunderstanding, we organize that natural and experimental history into a series of tables: including instances of the phenomenon's presence, closely related instances in which the phenomenon is absent, instances in which the phenomenon occurs in degrees or in comparison, and instances of exclusion of the phenomenon. Once these tables are built, we review them and create what Bacon called a 'first harvest' of the phenomenon. In short, this is a generalized axiom unifying the phenomenon yet held close to observation. Once that first axiom is established, we return to the tables, highlighting privileged instances which are further classified as solitary, transitory, revealing, etc. These, then can be used to further refine the first harvest into further, more careful axioms.

Bacon profoundly influenced Elizabethan England. His empirical method sparked inquiry in almost all areas of human knowledge, and formed the basis for what we now call the 'scientific revolution' or the 'enlightenment.' And his influence on psychology and psychiatry is actually far more direct than most would assume.  Late in his life, Bacon became friends with the Philosopher Thomas Hobbes. In fact, Hobbes founded a Baconian reading group in Oxford, which is the forbearer of the Royal Society—the world's oldest scientific body.

Thomas Hobbes, who is most widely known for his initiation of social-contract theory in defense of absolute monarchy, opens his master work Leviathan with this bold claim:

&gt; Nature (the art whereby God hath made and governs the world) is by the *art* of man, as in many other things, so in this also imitated, that it can make an artificial animal.  For seeing life is but a motion of limbs, the beginning whereof is in some principal part within, why may we not say that all *automata* (engines that move themselves by springs and wheels as doth a watch) have an artificial life? For what is the *heart*, but a *spring*; and the *nerves*, but so many *strings*; and the *joints*, but so many *wheels*, giving motion to the whole body such was was intended by the artificer? [Ch 1, &lt;!--\S --&gt;1][#Hobbes:1651wh]

Just as his famous social-political philosophy posited universal laws of human conduct, Hobbes believed that the human mind followed to universal laws which were deducible through reason. Always a Baconian, Hobbes begins by separating those who have minds (humans) from those who do not (non-human animals), and then query the difference between those two.

According to Hobbes, humans surpass animals in this faculty: “that when he conceived anything whatsoever, he was apt to inquire the consequences of it, and what effects he could do with it.”  In addition, humans can “can by words reduce the consequences he finds to general rules, called theorems, or aphorisms; that is, he can reason, or reckon, not only in number, but in all other things whereof one may be added unto or subtracted from another.” [Ch V, &lt;!--\S --&gt;6][#Hobbes:1651wh].  

Thus we have the beginning of psychology: human minds work by the process of deducing consequences and abstracting from particular experiences to general rules through basic logical functions. 

Let’s take a moment to contrast this with an alternative approach.  René Descartes, who many consider to be the founder of modern western Philosophy, argued that the mind was wholly distinct from the body, and therefore subject to an entirely different set of laws.  His most famous argument for mind-body dualism asks us to doubt all that cannot be known with certainty, and then concludes that one cannot doubt that one is doubting; hence thinking; hence one cannot doubt that one is a thinking thing.  This famous argument (called the “cogito”) is contained the First Meditation. But Descartes offers a much more interesting and influential argument in a number of other writings. The argument appears twice in *The Discourse on Methods*, first in part 3:

&gt;...if there were such machines having the organs and the shape of a monkey or of some other animal that lacked reason, we would have no way of recognizing that they were not entirely of the same nature as these animals; where as, if there were any such machines that bore a resemblance to our bodies and imitated our actions as far as this is practically feasible, we would always have two very certain means of recognizing that they were not at all, for that reason, true men.  The first is that they could never use words or other signs, or put them together as we do in order to declare our thoughts to others.  For one can well conceive of a machine being so made that it utters words, and even that it utters words appropriate to the bodily actions that will cause some change in its organs... But it could not arrange its words differently so as to respond to the sense of all that will be said in its presence, as even the dullest men can do. [Ch 3, 1637][#Descartes:1968uf]

And then again in part 5:

&gt;[in looking at the body] I found there precisely all those things that can be in us without our thinking about them, and hence, without our soul's contributing to them, that is to say, that part distinct from the body of which it has been said previously that its nature is only to think.  And these are all the same features in which one can say that animals lacking reason resemble us.  But I could not on that account find there any of those functions, which, being dependent on thought, are the only ones that belong to us as men, although I did find them all later on, once I had supposed God created a rational soul and joined it to this body in particular manner that I described. [Ch 5, 1637][#Descartes:1968uf]

The same point appears in his *Letter to Henry More*:

&gt;Nevertheless it has never been observed that any brute beast arrived at such perfection that it could use true speech, that is, that it indicated by words or signs something that can be ascribed to thought alone, and not to a natural impulse.  For speech is the only certain sign of thought concealed in the body, and all men, even the stupidest and most insane, make use of it, but not any brute.  Therefore, this can be taken to be the true differentia between man and brutes [p. 297][#Descartes:ut]

In these passages, Descartes ascribes to humans alone the ability to use language and conceive of abstract ideas. He then finds that these abilities cannot be the products of material, finite reality. As experience is limited to finite reality, ideas of things that are not finite must be 'ascribed to thought alone.' Thus, these ideas must be innate to the mind and not based on experience. It  follows that that these distinctly human abilities are the products of a non-material infinite reality. In short, the argument is this:

1. Humans alone use language and conceive of abstract entities (i.e. 'infinity').

2. No material mechanism could ever use language or conceive of an abstract entity.

3. Therefore, humans cannot just be not material mechanism

Hobbes' asserted earlier that human beings could be imitated through material mechanisms, and that our minds are ruled by the law of inquiring of the consequences of an action.  This runs directly counter to Descartes' argument, as Hobbes believes abstract entities are merely the result of inquiring consequences. But insofar Hobbes has only made an assertion—a hypothesis—it needs empirical demonstration. To establish Hobbes' contention and meet Descartes' challenge scientifically, Hobbes must show a physical machine could, through experience, develop both the ability to speak rationally and conceive of abstract entities that are not clearly the product of experience (such as 'infinity').

It is easy to see how the process of 'addition and subtraction' could produce a concept of infinity. But it is hard to see how simple arithmetic could produce a machine that could “arrange its words differently so as to respond to the sense of all that will be said in its presence, as even the dullest men can do.”

John Locke follows Hobbes in this, just as he does in the development of political liberalism.  Locke’s famous *Essay on Human Understanding* opens with a fifty-eight page argument against the idea of innate ideas. Locke picks up the project where Hobbes left off, adding 'reflection' (what we now call 'introspection') as an additional source of ideas. For Locke, like for Hobbes , the mind is populated with ideas that originate in experience. We come to understand our minds, and how our minds occasionally lead us astray, by understanding the mental mechanisms that produce ideas from sensation. Abstract ideas like 'infinity' are the products of a process of abstraction:

&gt; Finite then, and infinite, being by the mind looked on as modifications of expansion and duration, the next thing to be considered, is, -How the mind comes by them.  As for the idea of the finite, there is no great difficulty...Every one that has an idea of any stated lengths of space, as a foot, finds that he can repeat that idea; and joining it to the former, make the idea of two feet; and by the addition of a third, three feet; and so on, without every coming to an end of his additions, whether of the same idea of a foot, or, if he pleases, of doubling it, or any idea he has of any length, as a mile, or diameter of the earth, or of the orbis magnus...This, I think, is the way whereby the mind gets the idea of infinite space. --[Book 2, Ch17] [#Locke:1959we]

But like Hobbes, Locke fails to explain how language structure could be produced by a finite mechanism.

At the same time Locke was writing in England, Antione Arnaud, a fervent supporter of Descartes' theory of mind, was developing a school of thought in France which we now call the 'Port-Royalist' movement. ([#Carr:1996uw]) The Port-Royalists held that the structure of grammar was universal for humans and could be reduced to the laws of logic. Unlike the empiricists Hobbes and Locke, however, the Port-Royalists, who including the great logician and mathematician Pascal, were dualists and theists. For the Port-Royalists, thought was different from language, although we tend to think in language through force of habit.  Pure thought, both in its content and its structure, becomes imperfect when 'translated' into an imperfect spoken language. A perfect language, and perfect grammar, would be possible if each word signified unequivocally a single simple idea, and the grammar of speech matched perfectly the 'grammar of thought.' 

The empiricists Hobbes and Locke have adequately responded to Descartes’ assertion that ideas about abstract objects could not have their origin in the physical, finite, world.  But neither of them have managed to respond meaningfully to the assertion that the ability to put ideas together *in language* cannot be the product of the physical, finite world.

David Hume, the great Scottish Empiricist is really the first to answer this challenge.  He took Locke’s argument against innate ideas and married it to the idea of a universal structure of the mind. First, he extending the argument against innateness beyond the concept of the infinite:

&gt; The idea of God, as meaning an infinitely intelligent, wise, and good Being, arises from reflecting on the operations of our own mind, and augmenting, without limit, those qualities of goodness and wisdom. [&lt;!--\S --&gt;2, p. 14[#Hume:IGMvPNU2]

And second, he advanced the thesis that principles of connection between ideas in the mind were regular and hence subject to empirical investigation. In fact, he posited three:  RESEMBLANCE, CONTIGUITY in time or place and CAUSE and EFFECT. [Part 1, &lt;!--\S --&gt; IV][#Hume:2000ws]

This thesis he believed explained the universality of human language structures:

&gt; It is evident that there is a principle of connexion between the different thoughts or ideas of the mind, and that, in the appearance to the memory or imagination, they introduce each other with a certain degree of method or regularity... ...Amoung different languages, even where we cannot suspect the least connexion or communication, it is found, that the words, expressive of ideas, the most compounded, do yet nearly correspond to each other: a certain proof that the simple ideas, comprehended in the compound ones, were bound together by some universal principle, which had an equal influence on all mankind.

Thus, with Hume, we can find the origin of the empirical study of the mind, although 'psychology' was not distinguished from 'natural philosophy' for at least another century.

It is important to point out here that for these thinkers, the objects of study are *ideas*.  The central claims are that there are regular, law-like relationships between ideas themselves, whether they be causal or grammatical. That central claim unites them with early psychology.  But as we will see, is the challenged in the Behaviorist revolution in the US in the early 1930’s and 1940’s.

#### Birth of Psychology: German Physiological Psychology in the 1880s-1890s.

In about 1847, four friends, three of them students of Johannes Müller (1801-1858), gathered together in Berlin to swear an oath dedicating themselves to undermining vitalism: the theory that all living entities shared a special irreducible ‘vital force.’  They committed themselves to the view that:

&gt;No other forces than the common physical-chemical ones are active within the organism. In those cases which cannot at the time be explained by these forces one has either to find the specific way or form of their action by means of the physical –mathematical method or assume new forces equal in dignity to the chemical-physical forces inherent in matter, reducible to the force of attraction and repulsion. (Quoted in [#Bernfeld:1949ji])


These four friends were Hermann von Helmholtz (1821-1894), Carl Ludwig (1816-1895), Emil du Bois-Reymond (1818-1896) and Ernst Wilhelm von Brücke (1819-1892). They were joined shortly thereafter by Hermann Lotze (1817-1891) and his student Gustav Fechner (1801-1887) and came to dominate the training of the next generation of psychologist and psychiatrists: Helmholtz hired Christine Ladd-Franklin as his assistant, who went on to be one of the first woman members of the APA, and the first woman to hold a professorship at the University of Chicago. Sigmund Freud studied under Brücke; Ivan Pavlov under Ludwig and Wilhem Wundt under du Bois-Reymond. Wundt went on to work in Helmholtz’s lab after Ladd-Franklin returned to America.

While all four of these thinkers had a profound influence on the founding and development of psychology as a discipline, we’ll focus attention for the moment on Helmholtz.  

Helmholtz was one of the great scientific minds of his era. Not only is he now recognized as a godfather of experimental psychology, he is widely respected in the history or Optics, and is, in many ways, the father of ophthalmology, having invented the ophthalmoscope.

His professor, Müller, held that nerves had 'specific sense energies' naturally: our sensory system had certain *a priori* assumptions about time and space literally built into them, making sensory experience like binocular vision possible. Students familiar with the history of philosophy may recognize this as a position influenced by Kantian psychology.

Helmholtz, however, posited that our mental system as a whole adjusted itself through a process of 'unconscious inference' to represent the external world. The contents of our experiences---the redness of a red apple, for example---are merely 'signs' or 'indicators' of the objects in the world that our experiences represent.  Our sensory systems automatically and unconsciously *recover* the world through the complex information to which it has access. 

Unconscious inferences that produce stable representations (I.e. experience of a red apple) are *not* accessible to us through mere reflection, but neither are they ‘built in’ or ‘innate.’  They are, in short, trained through experience with the regularities of the world itself. The process of sensation is learned, not biologically determined. While contemporary psychophysics has advanced greatly since 1850, the basic model of how perception works in psychology today is Helmholtz's.

#### Major areas of research during the infancy of psychology
##### Sensation and Perception: Fechner

On the morning of 22nd of October, 1850, a young physiologist named Gustav Theodor Fechner lay in bed, puzzled by the relationship between the intensity of a psychological experience (i.e. hearing a sound, measured by introspection) and the intensity of the physical stimulus (i.e. the amplitude of the air vibrations). On that morning, it occurred to him that the relative increase in the physical stimulus might correspond to the relative increase in the psychological experience.  It took him a decade to prepare the idea for publication, which he presented as 'Weber's law':

&lt;!--\[ dp  = k(dS/S) \]--&gt;

where dp is the change in the psychological experience, k is a constant to be determined experimentally, dS is the change in the stimulus and S is the stimulus. He added to this the idea that the physical stimulus must break a certain threshold to be perceivable at all to derive what is now known as 'Fechner's law’:

&lt;!--\[ p = k\ln(S/S_{0}) \] --&gt;

Where S0 is the threshold under which the stimulus is not perceived.

Fechner's law is the first mathematical law (some might say 'model') in psychology.  It posits a specific relationship between a psychological entity (sensation) and a physical entity (the stimulus).  Unlike his predecessors who had contented themselves with discovering the relationships between ideas in a rather imprecise way, Fechner had both bridged the divide between the psychological and the physical, and given that bridge the precision of Calculus.  

Fechner's book, Elements of Psychophysics, published in 1860, had a profound effect in both Germany and England.  Physiologists now had a model of precision for which they could strive. And psychologists had a model of understanding the relationships between the physical and the psychological. Most importantly, however, the book inspired Hermann Ebbinghaus to begin studying memory.  But that story will have to be left to another time.

##### Introspection: Wundt

Today, we generally consider Wilhem Wundt's lab at Leipzig to be the first true psychological laboratory.  Helmholtz's lab, it is argued, was a lab of physiology, not psychology. But that distinction can be argued over. Wundt, unlike Helmholtz, believed that the causal relations governing ideas and experience were of a different *kind* than those governing the physical world. And it was the challenge of psychology to discover those laws and observe those regularities.

Wundt was, however, a student of Helmholtz. He didn’t run off an join Descartes in reflection.  Rather, he believed that the proper explanation of the laws of psychology would make use of the properties of the central nervous system. In Wundt's own words:

&gt;Physiology and psychology cover, between them, the field of vital phenomena; they deal with the facts of life at large, and in particular with the facts of human life. Physiology is concerned with all those phenomena of life that present themselves to us in sense perception as bodily processes, and accordingly form part of that total environment which we name the external world. **Psychology, on the other hand, seeks to give account of the interconnection of processes which are evinced by our own consciousness**, or which we infer from such manifestations of the bodily life in other creatures as indicate the presence of a consciousness similar to our own. (1902, p. 1)

Shortly thereafter, he asserts that Psychology is “**the investigation of conscious process in the modes of connection peculiar to them.**” (1902, p. 2) As consciousness is a unique phenomenon in this world, it can only, then, be approached with the investigative tools unique to consciousness: direct experience of consciousness by ourselves of inferred in others on the basis of direct observation and analogy. This does not mean, however, that a science of psychology is purely introspective. On the contrary, Wundt proposed a 'physiological psychology': a theory of conscious experience informed by our physiological understanding of the brain, what Wundt calls the 'bodily substrate of mental life.'

The nervous system was thought to be made up of a 'central substance' that maintained an equilibrium and 'nerve-fibres' that connected cells together. This 'central stuff' was understood not to just transmit information, but to modify it in one of two ways: first, if it were exposed to repeated stimulus, the amount of energy needed to produce a response would decrease, and second, in some cases, it could invert the signal into it's opposite (i.e. from 'x more than equilibrium' to 'x less than equilibrium'). Wundt sought to reduce Hume’s four standard 'Laws of Association' of ideas—similarity, contrast, spatial and temporal contiguity— to simple 'internal connection', as 'contrast' is a completion of an idea in the same way 'similarity' is; and contiguity in space and time are external, not internal, relationships. Ideas tend to produce their contrasting idea, rather than ideas which are similar, when they are accompanied by strong feelings, as all feelings have a kind of 'elasticity' to them, always presenting with its opposite feeling implicitly.

'Internal connection,' is then is explained by what Wundt called 'central innervation,' or the properties of the nervous system.  It is a fundamental law of neuroscience, even then, that 'neurons that wire together fire together.'  For Wundt and his followers, the similarity and contrast of ideas was explainable by the excitation and inhibition properties of these nerves.

##### Behavior: Pavlov

Ivan Pavlov was, like the others in this section, a physiologist first. His interest in psychology was, for the most part, tangential to his work in physiology. Between 1891 and 1900, Pavlov conducted a series of experiments on salivation in dogs. His primary interest at this time was to explain why dogs salivated when presented with food at a distance. The common-sense psychological explanation, of course, is that the dog wants the food. Or even that the dog *imagines* or *anticipates* having the food. More technically, early psychologists would have said the dog *associates* food and saliva. But these are not physiological explanations, and they would not satisfy Pavlov.

Using a recently invented apparatus, Pavlov was able to measure the amount of saliva dogs produced in response to a food stimulus. After a number of experiments, Pavlov noticed that the dogs were salivating without any food present. It occurred to him that in these case, the dogs' salivation response might be responding to the lab techs, rather than food itself. To test this hypothesis, he presented food to a dog and simultaneously rang a bell. After repeated exposures to this combination of stimuli, Pavlov removed the food, leaving just the bell. He found that the dogs still salivated.

Thus, Pavlov discovered what came to be called 'classical conditioning': to train a behavior, one presents a new stimulus (the conditioned stimulus) concurrently with the stimulus that 'naturally' produces the desired behavior (the unconditioned stimulus). After repeated training, the desired behavior (conditional response) will occur with the new (conditioned) stimulus, without the presence of the original, 'natural,' unconditioned stimulus.

Pavlov's primary application of his findings were to the nervous system as a whole as well as “heart, digestive tract and other organs in the higher animals” (lecture 23), he didn't shy away from suggesting that it could be used to explain the seemingly involuntary habitual actions of those deemed 'psychotic' or 'neurotic.' Conditional responses were, however, breakable, or in behaviorists terms 'extinguishable,' if one conditioned a new stimulus in place of the existing stimulus-response association.

Pavlov placed particular emphasis on the idea that his experiments were purely objective and not open to observer influence, such as the experiments of the Wundt and his ‘introspectivists.’ In fact, he closes his 1927 lectures with the bold claim that:

&gt;all the experiments, those of other workers as well as our own, which have set as their object a purely physiological interpretation of the activity of the higher nervous system, I regard as being in the nature only of a preliminary inquiry, which has however, I fully believe, entirely justified its inception. We have indisputably the right to claim that our investigation of this extraordinarily complex field has followed the right direction, and that, although not a near, nevertheless a complete, success awaits it.

The importance of Pavlov's theorizing should be obvious at this point: classical conditioning provided a physiological law-like relationship that could take the place of (provide the bodily substrate for) the association of ideas. And it provides a mechanisms for creating, intervening in, or destroying those associations—which no previous theory had managed to do thus far.
#### American Psychology: William James and the function of consciousness

During this period of profound growth and advancement of psychology in Germany, American Universities were not institutions of research, but institutions of education. Starting in about 1876, that started to change. Johns Hopkins University was founded in Baltimore in 1876 with the explicit mission of "The encouragement of research; the encouragement of young men; the advancement of individual scholars, who by their excellence will advance the sciences they pursue, and the society where they dwell." 

Of the 53 men appointed to the faculty of Hopkins by 1884, nearly all had been educated at German Universities, and 13 held what was then a German degree, the “PhD.” The few exceptions to this rule were the eminent American pragmatists John Dewey and C.S. Peirce.  

What followed can only be described as an explosion in research universities in America. Clark University was founded in 1887 and the University of Chicago in 1892.  In 1860, no PhDs were awarded in America. By 1890, 164 PhDs had been given. The first of these in ‘Psychology’ was given to G. Stanley Hall by Harvard in 1878.

I mention all of this because the German understanding of the science of the mind---specifically that of Helmholtz and his anti-vitalists---became synonymous with the understanding of research in Psychology during this period. In short, if one approached the mind in some fashion other than this experimental tradition, it simply was viewed as not contributing to research, and hence, was not considered suitable for graduate instruction. More often that not, advocates for views not in accordance with physiological-psychology were restricted to departments of philosophy or anthropology. A particularly good example of this kind of reasoning is G. Stanley Hall’s 1879 paper ‘Philosophy in the United States,’ in which he laments American Philosophy as little more mental discipline and moral training in the Christian tradition.

In the middle of this storm sits William James. James, in many ways, bridges the divide between the older approach to liberal education and the new approach to research as a function of the university. James himself accredits his interest in Psychology to his time spent in Germany, yet his entire career was spent teaching at the traditional college: Harvard. He advocated for experimentalists, but appeared to perform no psychological experiences himself. His students are the major figures in this first generation of research institutions and Psychology departments, including G. Stanley Hall; yet his position was always in the department of Philosophy, something he appeared to have insisted upon. James had a life-long friendship with the two Hopkins pragmatists, C.S. Peirce and John Dewey, who went on to supervise Christine Ladd-Franklin at Hopkins. Moreover, James was in frequent contact with the early British philosophers of mind including Alexander Bain, Herbert Spencer and John Sully.  

In 1878 James contracted with Henry Holt and company to write a textbook for this nascent field of psychology. The resultant book The Principles of Psychology is a classic in the field.  In it, James defines psychology as “the science of mental life, both of its phenomena and of their conditions” [p. 1][#James:1890wm]) and identified introspection as its chief method.

James held that consciousness (which was the central phenomenon to be studied by psychology) was like stream, encompassing much more than mere ‘associations’ of ideas. The associationists who followed Hume isolated experiences from their context, and provided a overly simplistic account. The object of study of psychology---the relations, tendencies and emotions that make up the stream of consciousness---are experienced directly in introspection, and form the basis of genuine scientific inquiry into the mind.

James' fellow pragmatists Peirce and Dewey went on to construct a theory of psychology focused on the  functions of mental states, what was called ultimately called “The Chicago School.” Dewey argued that explanations of human activity that focused merely on the 'stimulus' and 'response' or the British thinker W.K. Clifford’s ‘reflex arcs' were inadequate characterizations of conscious states. In order to truly characterize, and then study, conscious states, science must take into account the function or end of those states. In his words:

&gt;the distinction of sensation and movement as stimulus and response respectively is not a distinction which can be regarded as descriptive of anything which holds of psychical events or existences as such. The only events to which the terms stimulus and response can be descriptively applied are to minor acts serving by their respective positions to the maintenance of some organized coördination. The conscious stimulus or sensation, and the conscious response or motion, have a special genesis or motivation, and a special end or function. The reflex arc theory, by neglecting, by abstracting from, this genesis and this function gives us one disjointed part of a process as if it were the whole. [p. 370][#Dewey:1896vt]

Functional psychology thus emphasizes the role mental entities play in an organisms behavior, not what those ideas represent, or the 'content' of those ideas.[#Dewey:gu][#Dewey:1916tl]

#### Experimentalism: Ebbinghaus and the unreliability of introspection

In or about 1878, inspired by Fechner's stunning results investigating sensation, Hermann Ebbinghaus started experimenting with memory. Ebbinghaus sought, like all of his contemporaries, to understand the association of ideas.  But he was worried, rightfully so, that using existing words or concepts in an experimental design would allow for the individual subject's previous experience with those words or concepts to influence the result of the experience. Thus, to isolate the association of ideas from any prior influence, he created long lists of nonsense syllables (VAM, ZOK, etc.) and set about memorizing them. He then precisely measured the number of repetitions or amount of time it took to repeat list perfectly, something he called trials to criterion.  As it turns out, the longer the list, the more time, or trials, it takes to memorize it.  But that wasn't all: he further tested the process of forgetting.

After some arbitrary period, Ebbinghaus would return to the same list and restart the entire process. If it took him the same number of repetitions to memorize the list to perfection, his forgetting would have been complete.  What Ebbinghaus found was that even if he could not introspectively recall items on the list after some time, it took fewer repetitions for him to learn the list to the criterion or perfection. Thus, a decade before Freud made it fashionable to believe in the unconscious, Ebbinghaus had demonstrated empirically that the mind could retain information that it could not bring to subjective, introspective awareness.

This discovery was a bombshell to the introspective protocols of Wundt and James. Pavlov had shown that 'unconscious' behaviors like salivation could be trained to a stimulus without the intervention of introspection, but Ebbinghaus showed that a paradigmatic psychological phenomenon—memory—was subject to the same training. While Ebbinghaus' work was originally published in 1885 in German, it was not published in English until 1913---which ’just happens’ to be the same year James Watson declared the beginning of the Behaviorist revolution.

#### Psychology’s First Revolution: Behaviorism

John B. Watson (1878-1958) opens his 1913 manifesto “Psychology as the Behaviorist Views it.” with the bold claim that **Psychology**

&gt;“**is a purely objective branch of natural science.** Its theoretical goal is the prediction and control of behavior. Introspection forms no essential part of its methods, nor is the scientific value of its data dependent upon the readiness with which they lend themselves to interpretation in terms of consciousness. The behaviorist, in his efforts to get a unitary scheme of animal response, recognizes no dividing line between man and brute. The behavior of man, with all of its refinement and complexity, forms only a part of the behaviorist's total scheme of investigation.” [p. 158][#Watson:1913tq]

In a 1929 debate with the Harvard professor and physiological-psychologist William MacDougall (1871-1938), Watson anticipated a common criticism of behaviorism: that it cannot explain our rich interior mental life---what William James called the “stream of consciousness.” Watson responded that if we were to take the inner mental life as the object of study, rather than observable behaviors, there would be “as many analyses as there are individual psychologists. There is no element of control. There is no way of experimentally attaching and solving psychological problems and standardizing methods.” Thus, psychologists must limit themselves to “things that can be observed, and formulate laws concerning only the observed things.” [#Watson:iMwU-3B8]

According to Watson, ‘observable things’ includes only “what the organism says or does,” which must then be described “in terms of ‘stimulus and response.’”  By ‘stimulus,’ Watson means “any object in the general environment or any change in the physiological condition of the animal, such as the change we get when we keep an animal from sex activity, when we keep it from feeding, when we keep it from building a nest. By response we mean that system of organized activity that we see emphasized anywhere in any kind of animal, as building a skyscraper, drawing plans, having babies, writing books, and the like.”

Watson’s behaviorism explains the behavior of all organisms (not just humans) by producing laws of correlation between stimuli and responses. This was a massive extension of the field of psychology, as animals and babies were not able to give introspective reports. Following Pavlov, Watson contends that an organism initially engages is some random behavior (say, a baby squirming) in response to a stimulus. This ‘unconditioned response’ may be biologically determined, but it is not yet a law of psychology.  To ‘condition’ a response, one presents the unconditioned stimulus along with a new stimulus repeatedly. Over time, the organism responds to the new, conditioned stimulus with the original unconditioned response. Thus, to explain any given behavior, one must find the conditioned stimulus that is now correlated with the conditioned response.

MacDougall, among others, challenged Watson to explain “thinking” or “thought”  in terms of stimulus and response.  Watson does not shy away from this challenge:

&gt; “The increasing dominance of language habits in the behavior of the developing child leads naturally over into the behaviorist's conception of thinking.  The behaviorist makes no mystery of thinking.  He holds that thinking is behavior, is motor organization, just like tennis playing or golf or any other form of muscular activity. But what kind of muscular activity? The muscular activity that he uses in talking. Thinking is merely talking, but talking with concealed musculature.” [p. 464][#Watson:1926wd]

According to Watson, a child initiates verbal behavior by talking aloud to and about his surroundings. As that behavior is negatively reinforced, it changes to mumbling to oneself, and ultimately to keeping one's lips closed. It follows that thinking is not an activity of the mind/brain alone, but a kinesthetic experience of the entire organism—in short, a behavior.  Words are, in Watson's view “the conditioned substitutes for our world of objects and acts. Thinking is a device for manipulating the world of objects when those objects are not present to the senses.” [][#Watson:iMwU-3B8]

##### S-S v. S-R Behaviorism: Tolman and Hull 

During the middle of the 20th century, behaviorism in American divided roughly into two camps: Tolman and Hull. Edward Chace Tolman (1886 – 1959) initiated the 'war' in 1922 by criticizing Watson. Tolman argued that Watson's belief that all human behavior could be explained in terms of “muscle contraction and grand secretion, as such, would not be behaviorism at all but a mere physiology.” [p. 45][#Tolman:1922us]

For Tolman, a behavioristic science must answer three major problems: “(1), given the stimulating agency, determining the behavior-cues (2), given the behavior-cues, determining the behavior-object and (3), given the behavior-object, determining the behavior-act.” (p. 51).  (1) is the problem of psychophysics, which is adequately solved by Fechner. (2) is accessible, with rewording, by classical conditioning. (3) is the “important problem of motive.” A proper science of behavior must answer all three of these problems. Doing so, Tolman contends, would allow the behaviorist to understand and better elucidate introspection.

Opposing Tolman, Clark Hull (1884 – 1952) contended that in order for a postulate or theorem to be “truly scientific,” it must “take the form of specific statements of the outcome of concrete experimentations or observations.”[#Hull:1940ub] Simple classification of behavior are not, themselves, scientific. But neither is talk of such things as motives.  Scientific explanations must make use of clear, unambiguous terms that refer to  observable behavior. Everything else is simply not considered to be 'science.' Hull contends that psychology should produce mathematical equations that would specify precisely all the  relationships between variables that account for an organisms behavior. The specific behavior of a given organism would be an instance of these universal mathematical generalizations.

Hull's primary contribution to behaviorism is the thesis that that the when a given stimulus has the effect of reducing a biological need, the connection between the stimulus and the response is strengthened automatically. While that statement may seem like a commonsense position today (food given as a reward, e.g.), the important part of it in 1935 was the word of 'automatically.' Contrary to the introspectivists or even commonsense, one need not be aware of the satiation of one's physical desires in order to strengthen the association between the conditioned stimulus and the conditional response. In fact, most conditioned associations are not accessible to introspective awareness.

Methodologically, Hull's insistence on the mathematical-deductive structure of theory led to a cadre of young psychologists who were able to represent complex relationships between variables mathematically.  Many members of that generation ended up at Stanford, ultimately providing much of the theory of information processing that allowed the cognitivists to advance sophisticated mathematical and computer models of cognitive states.

In response to Hull, Tolman argued that simple stimulus-response connections were insufficient to explain behavior: specifically rats running a maze for a food reward.  In his famous 1948 paper “Cognitive Maps in Rats and Men,” Tolman presented evidence that showed rats that were allowed to wander around a maze randomly before the beginning of training period learned the maze more quickly than rats that began training without prior exposure to the maze. Tolman argued that the best explanation for this phenomenon---and our general intuition about why rats appear to pause before beginning down a specific course---is that the rats have built up a 'cognitive map' of the maze through their random explorations.  He goes so far as to suggest that the rats had the ability to learn through 'Vicarious Trial and Error,' or 'imagining' what would happen if they responded to a particular stimulus.  For Tolman, this was:

&gt;evidence that in the critical stages-whether in the first picking up of the instructions or in the later making sure of which stimulus is which-the animal's activity is not just one of  responding passively to discrete stimuli, but rather one of the active selecting and comparing of stimuli. [p. 200][#Tolman:1948ty]

One of Tolman's students, Ritchie, constructed further experiments to test the capacity of the rats' cognitive maps. By starting rats on the far side of the laboratory, Ritchie found that the rats tended to navigate not by the direct path to the reward, but to the walls of the room itself. Thus, Tolman contends, the rats' cognitive maps were 'strip-like' and 'narrow.'

It is this concept—the breadth or narrowness of cognitive maps—that allows Tolman to extrapolate to the human mind, going so far to suggest that we may interpret the various psychological mechanisms posited by psychoanalysts as “narrowings of our cognitive maps due to too strong motivations or too intense frustration.” Thus, racists, sexists, pathological patriots, etc. are individuals with too narrow a 'cognitive map.' A healthy mind---and a well educated person---is one who can use reason, i.e. “broad cognitive maps” to

&gt;“look before and after, learning to see that there are often round-about and safer paths to their quite proper goals-learn, that is, to realize that the well-beings of White and of Negro, of Catholic and Protestant, of Christian and of Jew, of American and Russian (and even of males and females) are mutually interdependent.” [p. 208][#Tolman:1948ty]

##### Operant Conditioning &amp; Radical Behaviorism: Skinner

Starting in 1938, Behaviorism underwent a radical transformation.  In that year, Burrhus Frederic Skinner (1904 – 1990) published The Behavior of Organisms: An Experimental Analysis, in which he introduced the idea of operant conditioning. ([#York:tqkKlD3E]) Skinner's insight was not entirely without precedent, but rather built upon the concept of 'instrumental conditioning' originally introduced by Edward Thorndike (1874-1949).  

According to what is now called 'Thorndike's law of effect', if a response is followed closely by a pleasurable experience, it is more likely to be associated with the stimulus than if it is followed by a unpleasurable or neutral experience. Skinner turned this idea into the central explanatory mechanism of behaviorism: rather than the conditioned stimulus occurring simultaneously with the unconditioned stimulus, the conditioning stimulus occurs immediately after the desired behavior as a consequence of the desired behavior. In his own words:

&gt;Operant behavior usually affects the environment and generates stimuli which is “feed back” to the organism. Some feedback may have the effects identified by the layman as reward or punishment.  Any consequence of behavior which is rewarding or, more technically, reinforcing increases the probability of further responding. [p. 129][#Skinner:1972wq]

By introducing the idea of reinforcement of a behavior as whatever makes it more likely that that behavior will occur, Skinner was able to undercut Tolman's (and MacDougall's before him) insistence that a purpose or goal was required to explain the behavior of animals.

As a boy, Skinner was fascinated with mechanisms.  Legend has it that he even built a steam cannon out of a discarded water boiler. Extraordinarily intelligent, Skinner found Francis Bacon's works at about fourteen, and became enamored with the idea that Bacon may have written Shakespeare's plays.  He majored in English and literature at Hamilton College, where he became famous for elaborate practical jokes.  During his time at Hamilton, he expressed significant interest in the authors Joyce and Proust – but also physiological psychologists Pavlov and Jacques Loeb. Legend has it that he met Robert Frost, who encouraged him to become a writer.   After that did not pan out, he returned to behaviorism through the work of Bertrand Russell---specifically Russell's comparison between 'reflex' and 'force' in physics.

Inspired by Pavlov's maxim “control the environment and you will see order in behavior,” as well as his passion for inventing mechanisms, Skinner began to create machines that would control behavior of an organism by automatically rewarding the desired behavior and punishing behavior that was not desired.

These successes led Skinner to hypothesize that all animal behavior---including human behavior---resulted from such forces. He delineated four types of operant conditioning: positive reinforcement, negative reinforcement, punishment and extinction, which he studied with mathematical precision. Skinner shifted behaviorism's emphasis from reflexes to regularities of the whole organism, moving from the causal link between stimulus and response to the relationship between the response and its reinforcement.

According to Skinner, this form of behaviorism was the inevitable development of psychology into a full-fledged science. Often pulling on an analogy to the history of physics, chemistry and biology, he argued that 'consciousness' and 'inner causes' were the remnants of superstition, and human psychology and society could be perfected through the principles of operant conditioning.  

Skinner adamantly insisted that scientific inquiry could not countenance hypothetical unobservable entities. Following Russell, Skinner argued that explaining a given behavior, such as 'eating,' in terms of a mental state, such as 'being hungry,' was ad hoc, equivalent to the pre-scientific explanation of physical events in terms of vitalistic 'forces.'  For example, if I explain why a glass breaks by referring to it's fragility, I've really explained nothing at all---I’ve only explained breaking in terms of being likely to break.  A genuine explanation of a glass's breaking is in terms of the environmental conditions and events immediately prior to the breaking of the glass. Likewise, explaining eating in terms of 'hunger' is hollow, repeating only the likelihood of eating behavior.

 Throughout his career, Skinner argued that radical behaviorism alone was the scientific approach to psychology. Theories---including Hull’s---cannot refer to underlying entities. When one objects that paradigmatic sciences like physics postulate unobservable underlying entities such as electrons, Skinner retorts that these are not believed by physics to really exist, but are merely convenient placeholders for the mathematical relationships that hold between observable entities. A scientist must restrict his or her work to observation, not theorizing. In retrospective appraisal of his own work, Skinner would claim of his work in Behavior of Organisms:

&gt;The notes, data, and publications which I have examined do not show that I ever behaved in the manner of Man Thinking as described by John Stuart Mill or John Dewey or in reconstructions of scientific behavior by other philosophers of science.  I never faced a Problem which was more than the eternal problem of finding order. I never attacked a problem by constructing a Hypothesis.  I never deduced Theorems or submitted them to Experimental Check. So far as I can see, I had no preconceived Mode of behavior—certainly not a physiological or mentalistic one and, I believe, not a conceptual one.” (1972, p. 112)

In the years following, Behaviorism came to utterly dominate American Psychology.  By 1960, for example, the standard textbook for experimental psychology, Burton G. Andreas' Experimental Psychology could confidently assert:

**Psychology seeks to express the laws of behavior.** It makes the assumption that all aspects of behavior, like other natural phenomena, are dependent on the conditions under which the behavior occurs... Psychology seeks to describe the dependence of the activities of people or animals on their environments and states of being. Psychology's place is delineated by this particular goal and the specific techniques devised for striving toward it. (1960, p. 4)

#### Concurrent developments: Logic and Computing

In 1812, George Boole (1815-1864) published The Laws of Thought, which is now regularly classified as a classic work in Logic. The opening paragraph, however, suggests a different discipline:

&gt; The design of the following treatise is to investigate the fundamental laws of those operations of the mind by which reasoning is performed; to give expression to them in the symbolic language of a Calculus, and upon this foundation to establish the science of Logic and construct its method; to make that method itself the basis of a general method for the application of the mathematical doctrine of Probabilities; and, finally, to collect from the various elements of truth brought to view in the course of these inquiries some probable intimations concerning the nature and constitution of the human mind. --- Laws of Thought (1854) Ch1 Para1

Boole, like his predecessor David Hume, believed that the rules that regulate the human mind were simple, and complex ideas were structured out of simple ones in the same way complex theorems are constructed out of simple axioms via logical transformations.

The history of Logic is of great importance here because in 1950, a brilliant young logician named Alan Turing proposed a theoretical physical machine that would be capable of carrying out logical functions.  That theoretical machine ultimately became the digital computer we know today.

He further proposed that such a machine could be taught to understand human language, and one could test the sophistication of that teaching by a simple empirical test, now known as the 'Turing test.'  An interviewer would have a conversation with two individuals, one human and one computer, for a period of time. If, after five minutes or so, the interviewer could not tell the difference between the two, we would be in a position of calling the machine a 'thinking' machine.  Writing in 1950, Turing claims:

&gt;“I believe that in about fifty years' time it will be possible, to programme computers, with a storage capacity of about 109, to make them play the imitation game so well that an average interrogator will not have more than 70 per cent chance of making the right identification after five minutes of questioning.”

In short, Turing's ideal machine would 'respond to the sense of all that will be said in its presence, as even the dullest men can do.'   The challenge set by Descartes and dreamt about by Hobbes, Locke and Hume to create a physical device capable of using language in a productive and systematic way was to be met, at least, theoretically, by a machine, the digital computer.

The question that remains for you, in the course of this game, is whether or not Turing's discovery of the logical functions that meet Descartes' challenge in fact lead to, in Boole's words “probable intimations concerning the nature and constitution of the human mind,” and whether or not those 'probable intimations' are scientific in nature.

#### The Second Revolution: Cognitive Science

In 1957, two books were published on the topic of language use by humans. As we have discussed, philosophers of mind have long considered language-use *the* defining characteristic of humanity---the behavior that distinguishes humans from animals and thinking from instinct. The empirical study of language-use therefore, has the potential to quantify, analyze and observe, with scientific reliability, what we are as thinking beings.

In the first, Verbal Behavior, B.F. Skinner explained humans' language use in terms of operant conditioning.  Verbal behavior is particularly interesting for the behaviorist because it isn't directly reinforced by the world, but rather mediated by another person via his or her own verbal behavior. In fact, this unique feature comes to form Skinner's definition of verbal behaviors: those behaviors that are 'reinforced through the mediation of other persons' (1957, p. 2). He later refines and restricts that definition thus: “If we make the further provision that the 'listener' must be responding in ways which have been conditioned precisely in order to reinforce the behavior of the speaker, we narrow our subject to what is traditionally recognized as the verbal field.” (p. 225) This definition, you'll no doubt notice, makes no reference to vocalization, words, sentences, thoughts, phonemes, meanings, semantics, grammar, or anything else typically associated with language-behavior.

The second was Noam Chomsky's first book, Syntactic Structures. Chomsky opens by noting that the set of all grammatical sentences in any given language, while infinite, is not random. There are sentences like 'Colorless green ideas sleep furiously' which may have never occurred in English before 1957, but nonetheless are grammatical sentences; while at the same time, there are sentences like 'Furiously sleep ideas green colorless' that are not grammatical. He then proposes that an adequate theory of language ought to describe a device that generates all and only the sentences that are grammatical in that language. Any theory that can't generate the set of grammatical sentences simply is not an adequate explanation of human language-behavior.

Central to Chomsky's theory is the thesis that humans differ from animals in their ability to use language. You'll remember from the beginning of this history that that view was shared by Rene Descartes and the Port-Royalists, who used it to argue for the distinction between the soul (mind) and the body. For Chomsky, however, the ability to use language does not entail a non-physical soul. Turing's machines showed that a physical entitled generate new and novel sentences that follow the grammatical structures. Verbal behavior, the defining feature of human psychology, is the ability to structure sentences in new and novel ways via the process of recursion, but that does not mean that human minds are non-physical entities.

Not only do the cognitivists reject the behaviorists conjecture that one can explain human behavior without reference to internal states, they reject the behaviorists rejection of the thesis that there is a dividing like between “man and brutes.”

In 1959, Chomsky published a vitriolic review of Skinner's Verbal Behavior, in which he claimed that not only were Skinner's definitions of reinforcement and conditioning either confused or circular, he argues that empirically, children learn grammar at a higher rate than can be explained by operant conditioning. It is included in the appendix.

In the decade before these tumultuous years, the Macy foundation had sponsored series of conferences that introduced some of great early mathematicians and computer scientists including John von Neumann (father of most computer languages), Norbert Wiener (founder of cybernetics), Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts (who together created a mathematical model of a neuron, which is the basis for all neural network architecture), Julian Bigelow and Arutuo Rosenblueth (also pioneering cyberneticists) to the great social scientists and psychologists of the day, including the anthropologist Margaret Mead, the Gestalt psychologist Wolfgang Köhler. The goal of these workshops was to investigate the similarities between computational machines and human minds and social structures. Behaviorists almost never attended. While the results from these conferences were minimal, they set the stage for MIT's Second Symposium on Information theory, September 10-12 1956, that forever changed forever the face of psychology.  

At that conference, Alan Newell and Herbert Simon, computer scientists from Carnegie-Melon, presented a simple machine that could do logic proofs and Noam Chomsky presented his idea of a transformative-generative grammar as the basis of language. George Miller writes, in an unpublished paper presented at MIT and repeatedly cited by historians of cognitive science, that he came away from the conference with a sense “more intuitive than rational, that human experimental psychology, theoretical linguistics, and the computer simulation of the cognitive process were all the pieces from a larger whole, and that the future would see a progressive elaboration and coordination of their shared concerns.”  Miller recalls Newell telling him “Chomsky was developing exactly the same kind of ideas for language that he and Herb Simon were developing for theorem-proving.”

And so began 'the Cognitive Revolution”.

            <Comments>The four idols distinguished by Bacon are the idols of the tribe, the cave, the marketplace and the theater.  The idols of the tribe are those which we all share, as a function of our biology. They “have their origin either in the regularity of the substance of the human spirit; or in its prejudices; or in its limitations; or in its restless movement; or in the influence of the emotions; or in the limited powers of the senses; or in the mode of impression” (LII)
The idols of the cave are those of an individual. They have their origin in “the individual nature of each man's mind and body; and also in his education, way of life and chance events.” (LIII)
The idols of the marketplace are those of miscommunication and misunderstanding. As Bacon says “For men believe that their reason controls words. But it is also true that words retort and turn their force back upon the understanding; and this has rendered philosophy and the science sophistic and unproductive.” (LIX)
The idols of the theater are those of intellectual 'showmanship.' They are “not innate or stealthily slipped into the understanding; they are openly introduced and accepted on the basis of fairytale theories and mistaken rules of proof.” (LXI)
All quotes from Bacon &amp; Jardin (2000).  Roman numerals indicate Aphorism number.
For those of you who have read Rene Descartes *Meditations on First Philosophy* will no doubt recognize that Descartes predicated his entire philosophical system on the idea that working alone by pure reflection, he could discover immutable truths about the universe.
Bacon lists 27 different types of these 'privileged instances' in Book 2 of his Novum Organon.
There are many instances of this claim in the history of psychology: see, e.g. Wundt, 1876 (p. 175)
I can illustrate some of the differences in theoretical approach here with the example of color perception: Helmholtz posited that there were three basic primary colors: red, green and purple.  Ladd-Franklin argued that purple perceptually appeared to be (i.e. ‘looked like’) a mixture of red and blue, whereas yellow appeared to be primary. Thus, she theorized, there are in fact four psychologically primary colors: red, green, blue and yellow.  Helmholtz responded (quoted in Hering) that one could not draw conclusions about facts of physiology from direct psychological experience (i.e. introspection), therefore Ladd-Franklin’s observation had no bearing on the science of psychology.  While Ladd-Franklin’s point seems obvious and definitive against Helmholtz’s theory, it was widely rejected, on the basis of the unreliability of introspective reports and observations, in favor of the physiological reductionism of Helmholtz. In fact, it wasn’t until a plausible mathematical model based on Ladd-Franklin’s observation was proposed by Jameson and Hurvich in 1957 that the psychological community rejected Helmholtz’s theory in favor of Ladd-Franklin’s.
Experienced Reactors may recognize Helmholtz’ name from the Darwin Game.
*a priori* is a philosophical term meaning ‘prior to experience.’ It is frequently used to describe philosophical positions like Descartes’ that believe knowledge can be gained by reflection alone. In this case, it means that the nerves have assumptions about the world ‘built in’ before experience.  If you wanted to use a computer analogy, Müller believes that knowledge about time and space is encoded in our hardware, where the empiricists like Hobbes, Locke and Hume believe it is in software that is built through experience.
I am skipping, for the sake of space, the fascinating history of British psychology during this period, as it adapted associationism to the new physiology. See [#Daston:1978vx]
Daniel Coit Gilman, the first President of Johns Hopkins, admired not just the German University, but what he called the "German Mind" as well: “The thoroughness of the German mind, its desire for perfection in every detail, and its philosophical aptitudes are well illustrated by the controversies now in vogue in the land of universities.”(http://webapps.jhu.edu/jhuniverse/information_about_hopkins/about_jhu/daniel_coit_gilman/)
See Ch. V of [#Miller:1962vk]
George Miller argues argues that “If Watson had not been so inept as a philosopher, he might have offered behaviorism as a pragmatic theory of mind, comparable to Peirce’s pragmatic theory of meaning, James’ pragmatic theory of truth, and Dewey’s pragmatic theory of value.”[p. 66][#Miller:1962vk]
See &lt;!--\fullref{theparadigminexperimentapsychology:hermannebbinghaus}--&gt; for more on Ebbinghaus’ experiments. [#Ebbinghaus:1885ud]
In the interests of conciseness, I am skipping over the fascinating and under-rated history of Gestalt psychology. I do this with a heavy heart, as it is one of my favorite topics in the history of psychology. Characters who wish to engage with the tradition of behaviorism, however, should pay careful attention to Wolfgang Köhler's presidential address, included in the appendix, for the Gestalt concerns about this period in American Psychology.

This is only one of Hull's four criteria. The other are: (1) The definitions and postulates of a scientific system should be stated in a clear and unambiguous manner, they should be consistent with one another, and they should be of such a nature that they permit rigorous deductions. (2) The labor of deducing the potential implications of the postulates of a system should be performed with meticulous care and exhibited, preferably step by step and in full detail. It is these deductions which constitute the substance of a system. (4) The theorems so deduced which concern phenomena not already known must be submitted to carefully controlled experiments. The outcome of these critical experiments, as well as all previous ones, must agree with the corresponding theorems making up the system.
See the section on behaviorism in the 'Public Character info' section for more on the difference between operant and classical conditioning.
“Gradually it was found that all the equations could be written down without bringing in forces. What was observable was a certain relation between acceleration and configuration; to say that this relation was drought about by the intermediacy of 'force' was to add nothing to our knowledge. Observation shows that planets have at all times an acceleration towards the sun, which varies inversely as the square of their distance from it.  To say that this is due to the 'force' of gravitation is merely verbal, like saying that opium makes people sleep because it has a dormitive virtue. The modern physicist, therefore, merely states formulae which determine accelerations, and avoids the word 'force' altogether. 'Force' was the faint ghost of the vitalist view as to the causes of motions, and gradually the ghost has been exorcized.” [p 495][#Russell:2013wy]

### Brief History of the Study of Homosexuality in America

While homosexual behavior has appeared throughout human history, the notion of homosexuality as an “orientation” or “personality” is relatively recent.  The etymology of the word 'homosexual' itself shows the intimate connection between the idea of sexual orientation and the history of psychiatry.  According to the OED, the term first appears in print in English in C. G. Chaddock translation of R. von Krafft-Ebing 1892 *Psychopathia Sexualis*. Relevant sections are reproduced in Appendix &lt;!--\ref{app: KraftEbbing1}--&gt;.

The idea of homosexuality as a lifestyle connected to personality is, in the English speaking world at least, indelibly linked to the public persona of the author Oscar Wilde. While he was studying classics at Oxford, he began advocating aestheticism, the view that aesthetic values trump moral or social values in the understanding of art and literature. Wilde parlayed his success as a playwright into fame, cultivating a flamboyant public personal, known for dressing immaculately and flamboyantly, entertaining wealthy society women and having a sharp wit and his talent at dinner conversation. His masterwork ‘The Portrait of Dorian Gray’ plays with this persona in the characters of XX and Gray himself.

 In 1895, he and his companion Alfred Taylor were convicted of acts of 'gross indecency' and sentenced to two years hard labor. Their trial was 'the trial of the century' in the English upper-class, and to this day, many of Wilde's personal characteristics inform the common stereotypes of homosexual men, for example, fastidiousness with respect to personal appearance, extraordinary wittiness and social adeptness, esp. with upper-class women, are all traceable to Wilde himself.

The next fifty years were not kind to gay folks.  “Treatments” for homosexuals included surgical interventions such as castration, vasectomies, lobotomies, sterilization, clitoridectomies, hysterectomies; chemical interventions such as sexual stimulants, depressants, hormonal injections, and pharmacological shock; psychological interventions included adjustment therapy, psychoanalysis, hypnosis, aversion therapy that included electric shock and desensitization; and social psychological interventions patterned on Alcoholics Anonymous like 'Homosexuals Anonymous' and others.

One of the saddest stories of this era is that of Alan Turing, who was mentioned in the section above on &lt;!--\ref{concurrentdevelopments:logicandcomputing} on page \pageref{concurrentdevelopments:logicandcomputing}--&gt;. Turing was one of the greatest mathematicians and logicians of his era, if not the greatest. During WWII, he worked at Bletchley park as one of Churchill's famed code-breakers. His efforts in breaking the German codes lead directly to the development of modern logic and the invention of the electronic computer. He is generally considered to be the founder of both modern cryptography and computer science. While working at Princeton, he became friends with Claude Shannon, who is now recognized as the father of information theory. Quite literally, Turing is to the contemporary information age what Newton was to the age of mechanics, or Einstein the nuclear age.

But Turing was also gay. In 1952, he was prosecuted and convicted for being a homosexual. Sentenced to hormone therapy and stripped of his military clearance (remember, during WWII, he was directly responsible for breaking the German code, created the encryption for the Washington-DC phone line, and was privy to the highest secrets of the war), he committed suicide on June 7th, 1954. In 2009, the British Government started a program of accepting online petitions from citizens of the UK. One of the first to be submitted, and promoted by Richard Dawkins, was a call for an official apology to Alan Turing for unjust prosecution. On 10 September 2009, Prime Minister Gordon Brown issued a formal apology to Alan Turing, stating:

&gt; It is thanks to men and women who were totally committed to fighting fascism, people like Alan Turing, that the horrors of the Holocaust and of total war are part of Europe’s history and not Europe’s present. So on behalf of the British government, and all those who live freely thanks to Alan’s work I am very proud to say: we’re sorry, you deserved so much better.


During this dark period of persecution, advocates for homosexuals (at this time called 'homophile' organizations) focused primarily on changing the stereotypes of the homosexual as a step towards ending the criminalization of homosexual acts as well as the psychological and medical 'treatments.'  There was little activity within the scientific and academic communities on the issue. 

That all started to change when a young social psychologist named Evelyn Hooker started teaching at UCLA.

During WWII, young men and women who were accused of homosexuality in Pacific theater of operations tended to be discharged from the military in California ports, including San Diego, Long Beach and San Francisco. Many, if not most, of these young people could not return to their hometowns because of their dishonorable discharge from the military. As a result, a organic community of homosexuals began taking shape in many of these cities.

While teaching at UCLA, Hooker became friends with one of her graduate students, Sam Fromm. Sam was gay. In 1943, he challenged her to study 'people like him' to determine if they were mentally ill (specifically 'neurotic') independently of the biases against homosexuality inherent in the psychiatric tradition. In a 1998 interview, Hooker explained the significance of this phrase:

 &gt; “This bright young man, somewhere in his early thirties, had obviously been thinking about this for a long time. And by ‘people like us’ he meant, ‘We’re homosexual, but we don’t need psychiatrists. We don’t need psychologists. We’re not insane. We’re not any of those things they say we are.” (Eric Marcus, Windy City Times, October 31, 2007 • vol 23 no 07)

During the 1940s, Evelyn Hooker became a trusted 'outsider' of the gay community in L.A., but didn't want to conduct research on people she saw as her friends.

#### The Kinsey Report

In 1948, Alfred C. Kinsey (b. 1894 – d. August 25, 1956) published Sexual Behavior in the Human Male. It was revolutionary.

Kinsey and his assistants had interviewed 5,300 white males from all walks of American life. The interviews required up to 521 questions, depending on the interviewee’s experiences.  Kinsey reported that a large number of men—up to 45%—reported having at least one homosexual encounter during his adolescence.  These encounters are most frequent at young age, dropping to a stable 10% of the population by age 20-25. These numbers, Kinsey fears, may not tell the whole story because:

&gt;The social significance of the homosexual is considerably emphasized by the fact that both Jewish and Christian churches have considered this aspect of human sexuality to be abnormal and immoral. … Social custom and our Anglo-American law are sometimes very severe in penalizing one who is discovered to have had homosexual relations. In consequence, many persons who have had such experiences are psychically disturbed, and not a few of them have been in open conflict with the social organization. (p. 610)

The Kinsey report found that homosexual activity as a common part of male sexual development.  Self-identifying as a homosexual, or engaging exclusively in homosexual activity, was found to be more rare. But at 10%, it was almost twice as high as any previous scientific estimate. Almost as importantly, Kinsey identified the source of psychic disturbance not to be the homosexual activity itself, but the social structures that penalize such behavior.

#### Early 'Homophile' movements

\end{marginfigure}
--&gt;

Two years after the publication of the Kinsey report, a group of 'homophile' activists founded the Mattachine society, which is now generally recognized as the first national gay-rights organization.

 The Mattachine society, named for a European tradition of theater masks, sought to change the prevailing view of homosexuality by presenting the membership as no different than the mainstream heterosexual society. Its members dressed in suits and skirts, and showed no 'outward signs' of homosexuality. These 'outward signs' are, of course, those stereotypes we identified earlier as originating with Oscar Wilde. Mattachine society demonstrations---held annually in front of Independence Hall in Philadelphia on July 4th---were sober affairs of men in gray suits and women in dresses walking up and down in straight lines, conspicuously *not* holding hands or being affectionate to one another. When couples held hands, one of the leaders of the Mattachine society, Frank Kameny, famously scolded “None of that!”  See the "Rules for Picketting" published by the Mattachine Society in Figure &lt;!--\ref{fig: MattachineRules}--&gt;



At the same time, a secret social club for Lesbians called The Daughters of Bilitis was founded in San Francisco  by Del Martin and Phyllis Lyon. To stay in touch with its members they created a magazine called 'The Ladder', which came under the editorship of Barbara Gittings in 1963. The magazine flourished under Gittings' direction, growing from a simple hand-stapled newsletter to a true 40-page magazine. Gittings became a leader, along with Frank Kameny, of the Mattachine society.

--&gt;

#### Connecting these threads: Evelyn Hooker

After the publication of the Kinsey report, Hooker finally decided to meet Fromm's challenge. She designed an experiment to determine if homosexuals were mentally disturbed.  In 1954, she received a grant from the National Institute on Mental Health to run her study. She recruited 30 homosexuals from the Mattachine society as well as the gay community generally. An equal number of heterosexual men were recruited from civil organizations around the L.A.. Individuals in the groups were matched with respect to age, IQ and education level. All people currently in therapy for mental health were excluded from the study.  

This alone was a major step forward in the study of male homosexuality, as all previous psychological studies had found their subjects in psychiatric wards, army barracks or clinical settings. By studying only those already in psychiatric treatment, one cannot separate traits that may signify an underlying condition from traits that result from the psychiatric treatment itself.

Hooker tested the resulting 60 men using standard psychological tests: the Rorschach, Thematic Apperception Test (TAT) and the Make-A-Picture-Story Test (MAPS). The data was blinded and mixed, and then sent to psychologists with expertise on these the tests who were instructed to score them normally and return the scores.  Hooker found no significant difference between the 30 homosexual and 30 heterosexual males with respect to standard tests for mental disturbances, indicating that homosexual men were no more likely to be neurotic than equivalent heterosexual men.

Hooker presented her findings at the 1956 APA in Chicago. Her paper was published in 1957, shortly after Sam Fromm's death in a car accident.

#### Stonewall: The street activists


By the 1960s, tensions were growing in the gay community. Another group of younger gay activists were growing irritated with both the slow progress of the Mattachine society and its restrictions on behavior. In 1968, a group of young 'street-activists' disrupted a meeting of the American Medical Association in New York by shouting down Charles Socarides, a Psychiatrist known for his psychoanalytic treatment of homosexuals.

But everything changed forever on Saturday, June 28, 1969 at 1:20 AM, when the police raided the Stonewall Inn in Greenwich Village. These raids were common---the police would arrest everyone, roughing people up, and generally intimidating the population.  But this time, the gay and lesbian patrons of the Stonewall resisted. Events escalated. The riots that followed lasted until Wednesday night, July 3rd.

\end{marginfigure}
--&gt;

On July 4th, the gay community’s attention turned to Independence Hall in Philadelphia and the Mattachine society’s annual march. As usual, Frank Kameny and Barbara Gittings, long time leaders of that gay and lesbian advocacy group, required the women to wear skirts and men suits. But the tide had turned. The young protestors from Stonewall would not conform. Kameny’s approach of assimilation  to “straight” behavior had been surpassed by the direct action begun at Stonewall. Militant groups such as the Gay Liberation Front and the Gay Activist Alliance sprouted up overnight (both started in New York). Plans were made to confront those who continued to classify homosexuality as a mental disorder, and directly challenge those who continued to treat homosexuals using barbaric methods.

Those plans included San Francisco, site of the 1970 American Psychiatric Association’s annual convention. And you already know what happened there. (See &lt;--\fullref{prolouge}--&gt; if you need a refresher).

            <Comments>In Victorian England, 'gross indecency' was defined as sexual acts between men that did not rise to the level of 'buggery'.
There is a superb website in the UK that is collecting stories of patients, doctors and nurses from this era. All are deeply disturbing, some downright terrifying.  See http://treatmenthomosexuality.co.uk/.  I'll quote just one example here, as it so perfectly illustrates classical conditioning:
“We need to remember that the discussions that went on at Maudsley in the early 50s were constantly searching for ways in which we could understand the relationship between events, so again referring to the ideas put forward by Pavlov, Skinner and Wolpe, if a situation produces anxiety and at the same time there is another even occurring then buy the process of conditioning it's quite likely that the reaction of  anxiety will become associated with the unconditioned stimulus. By thinking along those lines it seemed to me that if the process of sexual arousal and gratification is linked with something, it may well become the preferred method of seeking gratification. It seemed to me that if a person wanted to stop being involved in and interested in make figures—so long as he had bisexual potential or interests—we might be able to utilize the other half of the spectrum of potential arousal signals. And, if we did that often enough, he then might be gratified by femininity.”

For the full statement, see http://www.number10.gov.uk/Page20571
You'll recall that Freud and the psychoanalytic tradition that followed him believed homosexuality was a regression fixation caused by an underlying, probably narcissistic, neurosis. See *Introductory Lectures* p. 376-384 and 529-531)
The often repeated statistic that 10% of any given population is gay or lesbian originates with Kinsey’s study.
The 'Society for Human Rights' was founded in 1924, but never gained national prominence.
Hooker, Evelyn. "The Adjustment of the Male Overt Homosexual." Journal of Projective Techniques 21(1957): 18-31.
The use of the word 'gay' as a replacement for 'homosexual' dates from precisely this time with precisely these people. The Mattachine society and the older organizations used 'homosexual' and 'homophile' to refer to themselves. Ironically, the use of ’Gay'  to mean ‘homosexual’ is no attributed to Frank Kameny himself, who started a “Gay is good” campaign in 1968, to parallel the “Black is beautiful” campaign.</Comments>

Structuralism

Bloomfield structuralism in American, originated with Saussuer's 'Course in General Linguistics' from 1916.  Bloomfield was sympathetic to Watson's behaviorism. Structuralism in Europe became identified with sympathetic movements in Anthropology (), Psychoanalysis and Marxism, but is largely known through the critiques by the 'Post-Structuralists' who rejected that movement.

Bloomfieldian structuralism was different.

Chomsky 1957:
3.1: argues for 'levels of representation' as necessary for adequate explanation. This is a theme throughout cognitive science, articulated most clearly in the work of David Marr.

2.1	Explicit analogy to mathematical, formal languages, and the rejection of the Markov machine as adequate.  This argument is simple and easy enough to repeat.
 Big point: pg 32. Linguistic processing requires 'phrasing' – which is analogous to Millers' 'chunking' in memory, and potentially analogous to the Gestalt's categorization.

It is important not to salve that response with the standard myth that Watson deconditioned Albert after the experiment: there is no evidence that he did, or that he ever intended to. Thus, my version of the proposed experiment contains no plan for deconditioning Albert. See the 'Actual History' section below for citations.

            <Text>## Judd Marmor, MD

### Your Biography

You were born in London, England in 1911.  In 1933, you graduated from Columbia University's school of medicine with a degree in Psychiatry. After serving in the Navy during WWII, you moved to Los Angeles where you developed a successful psychiatric practice.  Over time, your practice became something of a 'favorite' of the hollywood elite. As a result, you became particularly famous both in the psychiatric community as well as popular culture.  In many ways, you are the most famous psychoanalyst practicing today.

While you are a Freudian, you have always worried about the scientific rigor of the tradition. You generally advocate for psychiatric practice based on scientific principles rather than theoretical grounding – and this is no more important than in the context of homosexuality.

Your practice as 'psychiatrist to the stars' meant that you were constantly approached by young men, some of whom were extremely famous, who sought to change their orientation from gay to straight.  You treated them according to the orthodox practice of uncovering the patient's repressed feelings of rejection caused by his cold and distant father and/or his misidentification with gender roles because of an overbearing mother. But these treatments just didn't work.  In your own writings on this subject, you described your experiences thusly: “The gay men I saw were caught up, for the most part, in the common myth that it was bad to be gay and that if they possibly could, they ought to try to be heterosexual. I was sympathetic to their wishes to try to become straight if they could...  We used to think in those days that psychoanalysis could cure everything, from chilblains to homosexuality.  But I wasn't too successful. Some were able to function bisexually but most of them remained gay.” (quoted in Kutchins &amp; Kirk, 1997, p. 63).

In 1956, Evelyn Hooker published her study of the mental health of gay men in San Francisco.  This changed everything. In retrospect, you have said “The first time I heard Dr. Evelyn Hooker state that homosexuality was not an illness, I wasn't prepared to go all the way. This was in 1956 when she presented her study of gay men. I was sympathetic to what she was saying but I wasn't totally convinced. I still had a feeling that it was a developmental deviation.”

Those 'feelings' dissipated during the 1960's, when you became increasingly frustrated with your attempts to change the behavior of the many homosexuals who have sought your skills as a psychoanalyst.  You ultimately concluded that homosexuality is not directly harmful to the mental health of the patients, but the psychic conflict caused by the patients' beliefs that homosexuality is a mental illness and their homosexual orientation is. Homosexuality is, in your view, just a normal variant of human sexuality, not a pathology.

This conviction has lead you into direct conflict with many of your Freudian peers, who continue to believe that homosexuality is a pathology.  You suspect that this belief persists in the psychiatric community because of a simple scientific error: the psychiatric community only sees an unrepresentative sample of homosexuals. By and large, psychiatrists are only exposed to homosexuals who seek treatment for their orientation. And that population is exactly the individuals who experience internal conflict between their homosexuality and their belief that it is a mental illness. If psychiatrists were to interact with 'normal' happy, healthy homosexuals outside the clinical setting, they would come to understand that the homosexuality itself is not a mental illness.

Freud mentions homosexuality a number of places in Introductory Lectures on Psychoanalysis, and it is crucially important that you study these carefully.  Freud believes that sexual life of children, which is regarded at the time as 'normal' includes a number of activities that would later in life be viewed as 'perverse', including same-sex contact.  In Freud's theory, heterosexuality develops with puberty in normal people. In 'inverts' or homosexuals, something goes wrong in this development. The object of ones' 'natural' desire--the genitels of the opposite sex—becomes transformed into parts of the body that represent those parts in the same sex.  Thus, homosexuality is no different in psychological mechanism than a foot fetish or any other neurotic 'perversion' (see p. 376-384 of Introductory Lectures) Homosexuality is not a psychologically isolated condition. According to Freud:

&gt; “We are compelled, however, to regard the choice of an object of one's own sex as a divergence in erotic life which is of positively habitual occurrence, and we are learning more and more to ascribe an especially high importance to it.” (p. 381)

In short, homosexuality is a kind of neurosis, yet it is not, itself, particularly worrying. The action itself is merely 'habitual,' and hence can be cured through standard habit-blocking therapy (Freud suggests that paranoia stops homosexuality on p. 381 of the Introductory Lectures).  It is, however, invariably an indicator of deeper psychological problems, as the transference and substitution of the 'natural' object of sexual desire to a different object will cause neurosis. See Ch 26 of the Introductory Lectures, especially p. 530, for Freud's explanation of homosexuality as neurotic narcissism.

The current advocates of this view are Charles Socarides and Irving Bieber.  They will be your main opponents in this game. Complicating matters somewhat, you were actually classmates with Irving Bieber at Columbia.  You were friends then, and that personal relationship may be at stake in this debate.

You are also an outspoken advocate for civil and human rights of all sort, having written papers in support of the Civil Rights movement, against McCarthyism and in opposition to the Vietnam war.

You are currently Director of Psychiatry at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center and Professor of Psychiatry at the University of Southern California.

### Game Objectives

You are a member of the secret faction 'The Young Turks' with John Spiegel. This is a group of politically progressive psychiatrists founded in 1970, after the events in San Francisco, dedicated to changing the direction psychiatry for the future. You have a connection to the 'Group for the Advancement of Psychiatry,' which has been advocating for progressive causes—specifically, limiting the use of electroshock therapy, ending the persecution of homosexuals by the US Military, desegregating the American south, etc—in psychiatry since the end of WWII.  

As a first step, the young turks (specifically you) will propose to the Board of Directors that homosexuality be removed from the next edition of the DSM during the 1971 conference.  Your colleagues in psychoanalysis are not necessarily your friends here. In fact, your Freudian colleagues Bieber and Socarides are your opponents.  On this issue, your friends are largely hidden. You will need to figure out who supports such a motion, and who does not.

During this process, you will need to work closely with the chair of the nomenclature committee Robert Spitzer.  He is convinced that homosexuality is a mental illness, but thinks that the main advocates of that position, Socarides and Bieber, are pushing a social / political agenda, not doing scientific work. You will have to convince him that psychic distress in homosexuals seeking treatment results from the mistaken belief that there is something wrong with being homosexual.  Curing that distress is not about curing homosexuality, it is about curing the individual's social/cultural prejudices.

In 1970, Socarides published a paper in the Journal of the American Medical Association titled “Homosexuality and Medicine” (212 (7): 1199). Introduce a resolution in 1971 during ‘new business’ condemning the article as unscientific and calling for its retraction. Your proposal should call Socarides' theory a “monstrous attack on homosexuality.”

Once homosexuality is removed from the taxonomy of mental illnesses, get elected president. If you cannot do that, get appointed to the Spitzer Task Force. In either of these roles, you should advocate for the president to appoint a special director or task force to lead the effort of removing the stigma of 'mental illness' from homosexuality.

It is likely that Socarides and Bieber will move to abdicate the vote of the nomenclature committee. If you are president in 1974, propose a referendum of the membership on the issue of the declassification  of homosexuality. If you are not, work with Spitzer and the President to move the issue to a referendum.

During the restructuring of the DSM-III, you should be chiefly concerned with protecting the psychoanalytic tradition.  While you think that homosexuality is not a mental illness, you are not willing to give up the 'dynamic hypothesis': the Psychoanalytic commitment to the etiology of mental illness in terms of inter-psychical conflict.

**When, and if, the game reaches a point of trying to define mental illness**, you must pass a psychoanalytic interpretation of mental disorder / illness. If a definition contains reference to a 'natural function' or another similar assumption, you should fight that proposal.

### Specific assignments

During the first APA conference, you are to present your paper  “Limitations of Free Association” to the population. The paper is available in Arch. Gen. Psychiat. 22:160-165, 1970. You should read it, and present and defend the data in character.

As an initial member of the Research committee, you'll be called upon to judge the scientific legitimacy and ethical acceptability of proposed research programs.  You should make yourself familiar with the sections of the game book titled 'A Primer on Research Methods' and 'Ethics of Human Research'.  Your gamemaster will give you an additional sheet outlining the responsibilities of members of the research committee in evaluating proposals.

In 1971, propose that 'homosexuality' be removed from 302.00 of DSM-II.  In making this proposal, you should make sure you read out the actual language of 302.

In 1972, after Bieber's report comes in, you should propose a condemnation of Socarides' 1970 JAMA paper as a 'monstrous attack on homosexuality'. It is very, very rare for the APA to issue a public condemnation, so you will have to do your homework and be seriously prepared.

R. Green and J. Spiegel will be heading up a taskforce to report on the history of the homosexuality in psychology and psychiatry in 1972. He will invite responses to the report. You should be one of those responses. Bieber and/or Socarides will probably be the other one, so be prepared for a face-to-face debate in public on their view.

**Fission**: While you support the founding of the ApsaA, you are not willing to abandon the APA.

### History of classifications of mental illness

What makes a certain condition a ‘mental’ condition or a 'medical' or ’neurological’ condition?  Suppose you are a family doctor, and a patient presents with an unwelcome and unwanted problem---a twitch, perhaps. Do you call a psychiatrist or a neurologist? How do you know?

While behaviors associated with mental illness---hallucinations, catatonic states, mania, etc.---have been known since ancient times, psychiatry dates its regularization as a scientific discipline to the work of the French physician Phillipe Pinel. His *Traité médico-philosophique sur l'aliénation mentale; ou la manie* stands as the first attempt at a scientific classification of mental illness. The book, translated as *Treatise on Insanity* in 1806 by D.D. Davis, is excerpted in Appendix &lt;!--\ref{app: Pinel}--&gt; on page &lt;!--\pageref{app: Pinel}--&gt;.  

Pinel was an intellectual disciple of Étienne Bonnot de Condillac, who in turn, was a disciple of John Locke. Locke is most well known as the intellectual progenitor of the American Constitution, but his views on the nature of mind and the empirical basis of knowledge held sway over much of the Western intellectual world in the first half of the 19th century.  Locke's influence on Condillac and hence Pinel was two-fold: first, he held that all our ideas originate in sensation and reflection. Second, and as importantly, Locke followed Francis Bacon in teaching that all knowledge must be based on careful, systematic observation.

For the empiricists, it follows that insanity, which is a severe form of our ideas 'leading us astray', is explained by a incorrect connection and association of ideas. The mechanism is simple: some of our ideas have a natural affinity or connection with one another. Others are held together by mere custom or habit. Cases of insanity are cases where habitual associations become so disorganized they begin to effect the 'natural' associations. This misassociation can become so extreme that it can “set us awry in our actions, as well moral as natural, passions, reasonings, and notions themselves” (Locke, Bk 2, Ch 33, p9. p 317). To this day, we use metaphors like 'lost his senses' to describe someone with mental illness; and we describe poorly chosen actions as 'not very sensible.'

This is simply the theoretical basis for understanding insanity in the broadest possible terms.  To truly understand how mental disorder is defined and classified, we must consider how the mentally ill have been treated.

#### Foundations
##### Foundation in Empiricism: Phillipe Pinel

Phillipe Pinel (1745-1826) revolutionized the treatment of the insane. When, in 1792, he was appointed a physician at the main asylum in Paris---the Bicêtre hospital---the situation was dire. According to a biographer in 1846:

&gt; The buildings were unfit for habitation. In them were congregated men crouching together in the mud, in stone cells, narrow, cold, damp, destitute of air and light, and merely furnished with a straw bed, seldom renewed, and soon becoming foul and offensive; wretched dens, in which one would hesitate to place the meanest animal. The insane, who were immured in these filthy holes, were at the mercy of their attendants, and these persons were malefactors released from prison. The wretched patients were loaded with chains and manacled like convicts. Thus given up defenseless to the wickedness of their guardians, they were the sports of an insulting mockery, or of a brutality all the more blind that it was gratuitous. (Marx, 1846, p. 194-195)

Upon his arrival, Pinel immediately began advocating pity, respect, and compassion for the patients, not only for humanitarian reasons, but also in order to allow the Baconian method of careful observation. Given the terrible conditions at the Bicêtre, Pines argued, one would never be able to determine if the behavior of the patients was the result of some underlying condition, or the condition of the Hospital itself. Bicêtre's chief physician, Pussin, was sympathetic to Pinel's techniques, and began a pilot study of unchaining the patients.


Two years later, Pinel was appointed  chief physician of the Hospice de la Salpêtrière---Paris' parallel institution for women. There, the women were kept chained, often naked, in subterranean cells; subjected to the terrors of abusive guards and hungry rats. Pinel immediate banned the use of metal chains as restraints, allowed the women clothing, and established something resembling human civility. This act was mythologized during the French Revolution as part of the overthrow of the aristocratic order, and has been duly commemorated in Art.

Pinel's revolutionary kindness is not just a story of a sympathetic humanitarian.  Pinel's goal was to systematical classify mental illness in the Baconian manner.  The conditions of confinement found in the Bicêtre and the Salpêtrière compounded the patients' mental illness, and confounded his attempts at observation. In these conditions, one could not determine if the regularity of symptoms found in the population resulted from the illness or the ‘treatment.’ By providing the patients respect and dignity, he believed he could observe their mental illness in a more untainted form.

In general, Pinel followed Locke and Condillac in holding that insanity was 'derangement of the understanding’, yet extended the view to cover cases where memory, understanding and judgment were perfectly sound, and still the patient was maniacal. Pinel thus abandoned any formal all-encompassing theoretical explanation of insanity per se, and preferred to work with its variants, which he classified as mania, melancholy, dementia and idiocy.

Pinel spent a great amount of time showing that the conditions he was treating did not have a physiological basis. Much of his argumentation in Treatise on Insanity turns on the dissections performed on patients who had died while at the Bicêtre. The reason for this was two-fold: first, the ancient Aristotlean understanding of the mind held that mental illness resulted from too much or too little of one of the four main 'humours': black bile, yellow bile, blood and phlegm.  By showing that the mentally ill had no significant lesions in the brain, or imbalances in their 'fluids', Pinel was able to establish the independence of psychiatry from other forms of medicine.

Secondly, there is a long tradition of defining the 'mental' as that which is opposed to the 'physical'. For example, Rene Descartes famously argues that the actions of our bodies can be explained entirely in physical, mechanistic terms, except that which can be attributed to, in his terms, our 'souls.'  It follows then, that if an illness is to be truly mental, it must not have a physical explanation. And most importantly, physical causes are treated with physical interventions. As insanity was now deemed non-physical, the treatment cannot be physical. Hence, psychiatry is a discipline independent from physical medicine.

While Pinel had no strong theoretical commitment or agenda, by following Locke's notion of mental illness as a confusion of ideas, he made two significant contributions to both psychiatry as a medical discipline and our understanding of the mind more broadly: First, if insanity was just a misassociation of ideas, it was not a permanent, inherited incurable disease. Second, if insanity is a misassociation of ideas, it does not depend on or result from physiological changes. Explanations for mental illness thus did not require autopsy; and treatment did not require surgery. Psychiatry was, as a result, independent of medicine.

It is likewise important to recognize that Pinel was, in many ways, precisely following Bacon's system of investigation. He was not attempting to form an overarching explanation. He was setting down tables upon tables of observed facts, classifying and arranging phenomena, highlighting privileged instances, and was open to any and all techniques that might shed light on these cases. After initial observation, he split “insanity” into four varieties, distinguishing between the incurable dementia and idiocy from the often transient and curable mania and melancholy.

Therapeutically, Pinel called his humane treatment of the insane the 'moral treatment.' In his words,

&gt;I then discovered, that insanity was curable in many instances, by mildness of treatment and attention to the state of the mind exclusively, and when coercion was indispensable, that it might be very effectually applied without corporal indignity. (p. 108).

His therapeutic program meant paying attention to the environment in which the insane were confined. He changed the architecture, the diet, the way the nurses and orderlies treated the patients, everything.  He even went so far as to allow the higher-functioning patients to work as nurses for the lower-functioning. Patients were listened to. Careful, detailed personal histories were taken. Baths, walking and gardening were encouraged.

A lack of theoretical commitment meant that Pinel could borrow techniques from the many snake-oil salesmen and charlatans who populated Western Europe at the time. One of these fads happened to be mesmerism, now known as hypnosis. We’ll come back to the importance of mesmerism in the rise of psychoanalysis below.

As a follower of Bacon, Pinel was only interested tabulating observations of results, and comparing them against the observations of the condition without intervention.  He insisted that we cannot cure a disease until we know of the progression of the disease *without* intervention.  In his own words, “We cannot cure diseases by the resources of art, if not previously acquainted with their terminations, when left to the unassisted efforts of nature.” (p. 109). For him, extreme treatments could only be used in extreme cases. The curable would be cured by simple humane treatment.

It is worth pointing out that the word 'asylum' means, of course, a sanctuary or refuge. It *first* appears in English in the 1808 translation of Pinel's Treatise on Insanity, to reference the Bicêtre! It appears in English newspapers starting in the 1860's, to describe leper colonies---long after Pinel's 'moral treatment' had come to dominate the English treatment of the mentally ill.

##### Mental Alienation - Esquirol

While Pinel tended to think of transient mental illness as a confusion of ideas, he occasionally spoke of the role of passions in mental illness.  In the early pages of the Treatise, he hypotheses three different causes of insanity:

&gt;I now proceed to describe the general progress of periodical insanity. Among its various causes; exclusive of changes in the state of the atmosphere, my experience leads me to enumerate as the most frequent; undue indulgence of the angry passions; any circumstances calculated to suggest the recollection of the original exciting cause of the disease, intemperance in drinking, inanition, &amp;c. (p. 12)

Pinel's greatest student, Esquirol built on this hypothesis of 'undue indulgence of the angry passions' and redefined the notion of transient insanity as 'mental alienation.' It was Esquirol who grew the empirical understanding of the mind into a full-fledged psychiatric system. But like Pinel, the set of conditions he sought to explain were those with symptoms that were not obviously explained by physical, bodily conditions.

To Pinel's four-fold classification, Esquirol added monomania, or obsession with a single idea, as distinct kind of mental illness.  'Melancholy,' he renamed 'lypemania.' because the former implied the medieval theory of 'humors' and  'black bile.' 

Monomania, lypemania and mania were distinguished by the nature of the passions that are out of order: “The passions of the insane are impetuous, especially in mania and monomania. They are of a depressing character in lypemania. In dementia and imbecility, those only exist, which spring from the first wants of man,--love, anger, jealousy.” (p 26).  

As the curable, transient forms of insanity were diseases of malformed passions, their treatment required reforming or redirecting the passions. His five varieties of insanity are defined thus:

1. Lypemania (melancholy of the ancients) delirium with respect to one, or a small number of objects, with predominance of a sorrowful and depressing passion.

2. Monomania, in which the delirium is  limited to one or a small number of objects, with excitement, and predominance of a gay, and expansive passion.

3. Mania, in which the delirium extends to all kids of objects, and is accompanied by excitement.

4. Dementia, win which the insensate utter folly, because the organs of thought have lost their energy, and the strength requisite to fulfill their functions.

5. Imbecility, or idiocy, in which the conformation of the organs has never been such, that hose who are thus afflicted, could reason justly. (29)]

It is important to note here that the passions *accompany* delirium with respect to collections of objects.  One cannot be passionate without being passionate about something. The 'something' that is the object of passion is supplied by the senses---and hence, we're still within a Lockean framework of understanding the mind.  

According to the Lockean framework, all ideas originate in sense experience or internal reflection. When the passions directed at one of these ideas becomes excessive and out of control, lypemania or monomania results, depending on the nature of the particular passion that becomes excessive. When the passions are exaggerated without a specific object, and hence apply themselves to every object, or what ever object is before the senses at a particular moment, we call that mania.

Mental illness's causes “are as numerous as its forms are varied.”  Case studies presented in his Mental Maladies include climate, seasons, age, sex, temperament, trauma (especially during the first menstrual cycle for young women), excessive study, ambition, etc. Again, as in Pinel, the difference between the mentally ill and the mentally stable is one of scale, not of kind.  Everyone has passions---they are why we grieve, fall in love, work for that 'A', make personal sacrifices for our friends and families, etc.---the question of insanity is whether these passions are appropriate or excessive and whether they are directed at an appropriate or inappropriate object.

According to Esquirol:

&gt;“The first wants of man, limiting themselves to those connected with his preservation and reproduction, provoke the determinations of instinct; an internal impulse leads us to gratify them.

&gt;The secondary wants, attach themselves to the first, and the desires which they excite, acquire as much more energy, as we have means of satisfying them, They produce the primitive passions; in fine, they are the wants which are connected with our preservation; and are the fruit of our increasing intelligence and civilization. They engender the factitious passions,—those passions which cause the greatest injury to man, especially in the higher walks of life.

&gt;Infancy, except from the influence of the passions, is almost a stranger to insanity; but at the epoch of puberty, the sentiments, unknown until this period, cause new wants to arise. Insanity then appears, to trouble the first moments of the moral existence of man.
At mature age, the relations become extended, social wants multiple and the passions take a new character. In proportion as the amorous passions become enfeebled, those of a factitious nature grow strong. Personal interest, ambition, love of distinction and avarice, replace the charms of love and delights of paternity.

&gt;At this period of life also, mental alienation appears; insanity is more obstinate, and more concentrated. It passes more readily into a chronic state; and is more dependent upon abdominal lesions.

&gt;A sense of his weakness, renders the old man more clam; and while meditating upon the errors to which the passions lead, he isolates himself, and becomes an egotist.

&gt;Insanity from a moral cause, rarely exists with him, and when he loses his reason, it is because his organs are fatigued and exhausted. Hence, it is neither mania nor monomania which is developed, at this period, but senile dementia.

&gt;Of all moral causes, those which most frequently produce insanity, are pride, fear, fright, ambition, reverses of fortune, and domestic trouble. This last should have been placed, relative to its great influence, at the head of the moral causes, if it be limited to a simple ideas; but by domesticate troubles, I express all the pains, all the griefs, all oppositions, misfortunes and dissensions that grow out of the family state.
(Mental Maladies: A Treatise on Insanity, p 45-46)

Esquirol began to gather around himself a 'circle' of students who are sometimes referred to as the 'mental alienists.’ Two of the most famous of his students were Charles Lasègue, who is now credited with working out the first definition of hysteria and first documenting *anorexia nervosa*; and Étienne-Jean Georget who delineated four sub-types of 'monomania': theomania (religious obsession), ertomania (sexual obsession), demonomania (obsession with evil) and homocidal monomania.

Esquirol's concept of monomania sparked what is probably the first recorded wave of copy-cat psychosis. In November 1825, a young single mother of two named Henriette Cornier, decapitated the 19 month-old child of her neighbors. She had prepared her room for the act, even placing a bucket to catch the blood. She had known the family of the infant for only ten days, and had, up until this event, been nothing but loving and gentle towards the little girl who would be her victim. When the police arrived, she offered no resistance to the police, and did not flee. She confessed, saying that the idea had taken hold of her, and she simply had to act upon it.

The case became a sensation across Europe. Georget diagnosed her as a 'homicidal monomaniac.' At her trial, the jury decided that the act had not been premediated and as a result, she was sentenced to life in prison with hard labor instead of death. This ruling makes little sense: Cornier admitted that the idea had occurred to her before the event, and she had carefully prepared her room for the murder. Thus, many commentators---include Lisa Appengasi (p 75)---have attributed the jury’s leniency to Georget's diagnosis of mental alienation. After all, if Cornier was mentally ill, does pre-planning count as 'premediation'?

The idea of the murderous monomaniac took off across Europe, informing or appearing in some of the greatest literature of era, including (according to various literary critics) Poe's “The Tell-Tale Heart,” the character of Roskolvikov in Dostovesky's *Crime and Punishment*, and even Heathcliff in Bonte's *Wutherheights*. The Marquis de Sade is also said to have been a monomaniac.

#### Early Neurology

Western medicine understood that the nervous system used, or conducted, electricity from the Galvani’s famous frog-leg experiments of 1780. There were, as one might expect, different interpretation of the relationship between nerves and electricity---Galvani believed electricity was the ‘vital force’ contained in living things. Galvani’s colleague Volta, who went on to lend his name to the ‘Volt’, argued that the frog leg reacted to electricity, but did not contain it.
The precise relationship between nerves and electricity, as well as the relationship between the nervous system an our psychology, was not nailed down for a long time. But that didn’t stop researchers in this era from speculating wildly. One of the most famous, whose theories about psychology are enshrined in our language in terms as frequent as ‘nervous’, is George Beard.

#####  American Nervousness --- George Beard

George Beard (1839-1883) was an American physician who started out advocating for the use of electricity as a medical intervention.  His first book *Electricity as a Tonic* (1866) suggested that electricity could be used to cure 'general nervous debility,' including dyspepsia, chorea, neuralgia, anaemia, or amenorrhoea. (1867, p. 73) Beard was a charismatic popular author, who went on to write a series of popular home-healthcare books starting with *Our Home Physician: Handy Book of Family Medicine* in 1869.

\end{marginfigure}
--&gt; 

Starting in the 1870s, Beard became increasingly interested in psychological disorders. In 1881, he published *American Nervousness*, a book that came to define psychological treatment for a generation.  'Nervousness' did not mean then what it means today: jitteriness or tension. Then, it denoted a kind of fundamental exhaustion—what we still call a 'nervous breakdown'.  Technically, Beard defined it as:

&gt;“deficiency of lack of nerve-force. This condition, together with all the symptoms of diseases that are evolved from it, has developed mainly within the nineteenth century, and is especially frequent and severe in the Northern and Eastern portions of the United States. Nervousness, in the sense here used, is to be distinguished rigidly and systematically from simple excess of emotion and from organic disease.” (1881, p. vi)

It was caused by “modern civilization, which is distinguished from the ancient by these five characteristics: steam-power, the periodical press, the telegraph, the sciences, and the mental activity of women.” (p. vi)

Beard was building on both folk theory of innate energy as well as recent discoveries in neurology (compare, for example, the concurrent theory of 'specific sense energies' proposed by  Müller – see the &lt;!--\ref{birth-germanphysiologicalpsychologyinthe1880s-1890s} on page \pageref{birth-germanphysiologicalpsychologyinthe1880s-1890s}--&gt;.). But he extended his view to cover diseases such as “neurasthenia (nervous exhaustion... hysteria, hay-fever, sick-headache, inebriety... some and phases of insanity.” (p. vii) whose 'signs' could include:

&gt;The nervous diathesis; susceptibility to stimulants and narcotics and various drugs, and consequent necessity of temperance; increase of the nervous diseases inebriety and neurasthenia (nervous exhaustion), hay-fever neuralgia, nervous dyspepsia, asthenopia and allied diseases and symptoms; early and rapid decay of teeth; premature baldness; sensitiveness to cold and heat; increase of diseases not exclusively nervous, as diabetes and certain forms of Bright's disease of the kidneys and chronic catarrhs; unprecedented beauty of American women; frequency of trance and muscle-reading; the strain of dentition, puberty and change of life; American oratory, humor speech and language; change in type of disease during the past half century, and the great intensity of animal life on this continent. (p. vii-ix)

Beard died shortly after the publication of *American Nervousness*, but his cause was taken up by Silas Wier Mitchell (1829-1914), who popularized a standard treatment for American Nervousness: the rest cure. As you can probably imagine, if the cause of American Nervousness was modern civilization, including women having a mental life, the cure was removal from modern civilization, including banning women from having a mental life.

In 1885, at the age of 25, Charlotte Perkins Gilman, a member of a prominent family of American progressives that included the abolitionist author Harriet Beecher Stowe, the suffragist Isabella Beecher Hooker, and the charismatic clergyman Henry Ward Beecher, gave birth to her only child Katharine Beecher Stetson. After the birth, Charlotte Perkins-Gilman experienced what we now recognize as a severe case of post-partum depression.

She was taken to see Silas Wier Mitchell. She described her experience of the treatment she received thus:

&gt;“During about the third year of this trouble I went, in devout faith and some faint stir of hope, to a noted specialist in nervous diseases, the best known in the country.  This wise man put me to bed and applied the rest-cure, to which all still-good physique responded so promptly that he concluded there was nothing much the matter with me, and sent me home with solemn advice to 'live as domestic a life as far as possible,' to 'have but two hours' intellectual life a day' and 'never touch a pen, brush or pencil again' as long as I lived. This was in 1887.” (“Why I wrote The Yellow Wallpaper, 1913)

Her experiences you may know from the American Standard short story The Yellow Wallpaper (1892). Gilman acknowledged that she never suffered from the hallucinations her character does, but that she “came so near the borderline of mental ruin that I could see over.” (1913)

--&gt; 


While Beard and Wier Mitchell are today often ridiculed as snake-oil salesmen playing on political concerns over rapid modernization and the suffragist movement, they made a number of notable contributions to our commonsense understanding of psychological disorder. First, they indelibly linked mental disorders to neurology. As mentioned above, we still use phrases like 'nervous breakdown' in common parlance to explain psychological disorder. Second, by proscribing puberty, birth, menopause and the 'unprecedented beauty of American women' as prime causes of mental illness, they further established a link between the onset and frustration of sexuality with mental illness, a point upon which Freud would build psychoanalysis.

It would be a mistake, however, to accept the simplistic narrative that the doctors of this era were manipulating and abusing their female patients without their consent. Historians of Psychology Laura C. Ball and Jennifer L. Bazar have recently demonstrated that in some cases, some women aggressive sought out procedures, such as clitorectomies, in this period. In one remarkable case, a patient even 'tormented the doctors to operate again.'

One way to chart the rise of psychiatric diagnosis is to consider how people with mental illness are counted.  Starting in 1830, the US census included categories for the disabled, including 'blind' and 'deaf.' From 1840-1870, the census included the category 'idiocy/insanity.' Starting in 1880, however, the federal government began using categories of mental illness. In 1880, those categories were:
&lt;!-- \begin{longtable}[!t]{ |  p{1cm} |  p{1cm} |p{4.8cm} | }

\end{longtable}
--&gt;
Readers of these sections will no doubt recognize this taxonomy as owing an intellectual debt to both Esquirol (Melancholy, Mania, Hysteria and Dementia) *and* Beard (Nerves).

##### Early Neurology --- Charcot

Charcot began his career at the Salpêtrière tending to the 'incurables'—the patients whose conditions had been classified as 'idiocy' or 'dementia.' Charcot saw himself primarily as a nosologist: a classifier or taxonomizer of disease, rather than a healer. His appointment was, in many ways, ideal. This was a patient population for which there was no hope of cure, and morever, had not been studied in a careful way.  

&lt;!--\begin{marginfigure}
 \begin{center}

     \includegraphics[scale=0.25]{../images/hysterie-troisiemephase.jpg}

 \caption{Photo of patient of M. Charcot in the Salpêtrière. From Wellcome images, https://wellcomecollection.org/works/fh922zk8 }
\label{fig: charcotpatient}
\end{marginfigure}
--&gt;

Charcot is, today, often classified as a neurologist. That is a bit of historicism, as there was no such field when he began work.  In fact, the 'neuron doctrine', or the idea that the nervous system is composed of individual cells called 'neurons,' is not formally advanced until 1891. And it isn't until 1911 that Ramon y Cajal uses the Golgi stain to highlight neurons in the hippocampus, confirming the neuron doctrine.

None of that stopped Charcot from classifying a huge number conditions and diseases we still recognize today: multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS or “Lou Gerig's disease,” it was once called “Charcot's disease”), lenticulostriate artery (“Charcot's artery”), joint arthopathy (“Charcot's joint”), peroneal muscular atrophy (“Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease”), Charcot Wilbrand syndrome, Charcot's intermittent hepatic fever and even Parkinson's disease were all first named or described by Charcot.

Methodologically, Charcot advocated what he called the 'anatomo-clinical' method, which meant careful anatomical analysis performed largely post-mortum combined with case studies of vivisection in both animals and human subjects. Once a behavioral deficiency has been identified, careful anatomical studies are carried out to determine any corresponding anatomical 'deficiency,' or lesion. In his own words:

&gt;Allow me to recall to your minds the opinion which that most illustrious physiologist, Claude Bernard, thus expressed:—“Pathology,” said he, “should not he subordinated to physiology. Quite the reverse. Set up first the medical problem which arises from the observation of a malady, and afterwards seek for a physiological explanation. To act otherwise would be to risk overlooking the patient, and distorting the malady.” These are excellent words, which I have ventured to quote verbatim, because they are absolutely significant. They enable us to clearly understand that the whole domain of pathology appertains strictly to the physician, who alone can cultivate it and make it fruitful, and that it necessarily remains closed to the physiologist who, systematically confined within the precincts of his laboratory, disdains the teaching of the hospital ward. (p. 8)


In 1878, he began extensive work on hypnosis. Hypnosis had been practiced at the Salpêtrière for over 50 years--since the days of Pinel, in fact. Charcot became increasingly interested in the therapeutic use of hypnosis to cure what he called 'hysteria', a vaguely-defined collection of usually transient symptoms that included paralysis, anesthesias, visual or auditory agnosias, temporary blindness or deafness, amnesia and seizures. While 'hysteria' came to be identified closely with women, Charcot himself believed that it could effect men, and treated many men that he diagnosed with hysteria.

This does not mean, however, that Charcot gave up his commitment to neurological explanations of behavior. He simply allowed functional and/or physiological explanations in addition to the anatomical. In his words:

&gt; There is another important fact in the history of neuroses in general, and of hysteria in particular, which clearly shows that these diseases do not form, in pathology, a class apart, governed by other physiological laws than the common ones. (13)

I've quoted this passage because it is the first use of the word 'neuroses' in print.  It's root in neurological terminology is obvious, but here Charcot uses it to demarcate transient, psychological, functional or dynamic neurological conditions from the incurable, intransient, anatomical neurological conditions. The former we classify as ‘mental’, the latter ‘neurological’---even today. 'Neurosis' thus supplants 'mental alienation' and 'nervousness' as the descriptor of the set of psychological conditions that cannot be explained physically, even though it’s root is connected to the idea of a physical manifestation in ‘neurons.’

In 1890, blocked by antisemitism in Germany from further education, a young Sigmund Freud came to study with M. Charcot. There, he learned the techniques of hypnosis and studied many cases of hysteria. Later in life, Freud frequently referred to Charcot as his 'mentor,' and even attributed the idea that all neuroses originate 'in the genitals' to Charcot.

In his eulogy for Charcot, Sigmund Freud said:

&gt;He was not a reflective man, not a thinker: He had the nature of an artist—he was, as he himself said, a 'visuel', a man who sees... He used to look again and again at the things he did not understand, to deepen his impression of them day by day, till suddenly an understanding of them dawned on him.  In his mind's eye the apparent chaos presented by the continual repetition of the same symptoms then ave way to order: the new nosological picture emerged, characterized by the constant combination of certain groups of symptoms... He might be heard to say that the greatest satisfaction a man could have was to see something new-- that is, to recognize it as new; and he remarked against and again n the difficulty and value of this kind of 'seeing'. (Quoted in Mad, Bad and Sad, p. 128)

It should be fairly obvious that Freud here is dismissing, essentially, Charcot's Baconian approach to scientific classification: careful, close observation with only careful, conservative theoretical suppositions. Unlike Charcot, who is remembered only in the names of the diseases he classified, Freud became globally famous for his theoretical suppositions. Whereas Charcot was content with describing neuroses and localizing them in the nervous system, Freud sought to explain the origins of neuroses in non-physical terms.

#### Rise of Psychoanalysis

##### Hysteria and Hypnosis: Freud &amp; Breuer on Anna O.

By the end of the 19th century, we are beginning to find general agreement that mental illnesses are characterized by symptoms with no bodily, physical (or in Beard's terms 'organic') explanation. That understanding defined the limits of psychiatry. When a condition could be explained in anatomical terms, it was no longer considered psychiatric and reverted to medical or neurological. When it could not be understood physically---when it had to be explained in terms of 'psychic energy---it was given to the psychiatrists.

This thesis was not challenged largely because psychiatrists practiced in hospitals that contained psychiatric patients. That sounds circular, but it isn't: Pinel, Esquirol and Charcot were attempting to create a theory of mental illness that could explain the patients they saw before them. The patients they saw before them were not brought there because they fit the theory, or because they had chosen to be there. They were brought to the Bicêtre and Salpêtrière when the rest of the medical community had given up attempting to explain their symptoms.


The same can be said for Beard and Wier Mitchell: Perkins Gilman was taken to see Wier Mitchell only after all physical interventions had failed.

These founders of psychiatry theorized about a population that had been deemed mentally ill *because the medical community had given up explaining their symptoms*. Not the other way around. The Psychiatric hospital was a kind of catch-all for those individuals whose symptoms could not be alleviated by physical medicine, and hence it is unsurprising that the definitions of insanity we find in this era require the absence of a physical explanation.

Without a control population, there was no way these classifications could tease apart underlying conditions from any effects that may have resulted from being classified this way in the first place. 

In 1880, Josef Breuer, a student of the great psycho-physiologist Ewald Hering, was studying the ear as a part of his research at Vienna General Hospital. It was there that he first met 'Anna O.', a young woman with an extremely acute cough. Finding **no physical reason** for the cough, her family physician diagnosed her with “typical *tussis nurvosa* [nervous cough]” (p 27) 

 Shortly thereafter a number of other symptoms arose. Freud &amp; Breuer describe her case thusly:

&gt;  Before this time she too had always enjoyed good health, showing no sign of nervous indisposition during her development. Of considerable intelligence, remarkably acute powers of reasoning, and a clear-sighted intuitive sense, her powerful mind could have digested, needed even, more substantial intellectual nourishment, but failed to receive it once she had left school. Her rich poetic and imaginative gifts were controlled by a very sharp and critical common sense. The latter also made her quite closed to suggestion. Only arguments had any influence on her, assertions were without effect. Her will was energetic, tenacious and persistent, sometimes heightened to such obstinacy that it would give way only out of kindness and consideration for others.

&gt; One of her principle traits was a sympathetic kindness. Even during her illness, she benefited greatly from the care and support she gave to some sick and poor people, for it allowed her to satisfy a strong drive. Her spirits always tended slightly to exaggeration, whether of joyfulness or grief, and as a consequence she was also somewhat moody. The element of sexuality was remarkably undeveloped: the patient, whose life became transparent to me in a way that seldom happens between people, had never been in love, and not once in the mass of hallucinations that occurred during her illness did this element of the inner life emerge...

&gt;...The course of the illness falls into several distinct phases. They are as follows:

&gt; A)	Latent incubation. From mid-July 1880 to approximately 10 December. This  case was exceptional because it afforded so complete an insight into a phase that in most cases escapes us, and for this reason alone its pathological interest could not be overestimated. I will expound on this part of the history later.

&gt; B)	Manifest illness: a peculiar kind of psychosis, paraphasia, *stabismus convergens* [convergent squint], sever visual disturbance, paralyzing contractures, complete paralysis in the upper right and both lower extremities, partial paralysis in the upper left extremity, paresis of the neck muscles. A gradual reduction in the contracture of the right extremities. Some improvement, interrupted by a sever psychical trauma (death of the father) in April, after which

&gt; C)	A period of continual somnambulism ensues, which then alternates with more normal states; continuation of a series of chronic symptoms until December 1881.

&gt; D)	Gradual winding down of mental states and symptoms until June 1882. (p25-26)

Breuer took over her care during the period of 'manifest illness,'  during which, Anna O. slept for great periods of time ('somnambulism'), but when she awoke in the evening, she would complain of 'torment.' Her speech lost all grammatical structure ('paraphasia') and she would piece together words and phrases from the five distinct languages she spoke, producing an incomprehensible jargon. This same jargon appeared in writing, so Breuer knew that it was not a disfunction of the physical mechanism of speech.

In the early spring of 1881, Anna O fell mute for a period of two weeks. At this point, Breuer claims that he 

&gt;“knew she had taken great offense at something and had resolved to say nothing about it. When I guessed as much and forced her to talk about it, the inhibition, which had until then made it impossible for her to speak about anything else either, disappeared.” (p 29)

After her father's death, her illness became much more severe. Breuer noticed, however, that her periods of sleep in the later afternoon, during which she was 'tormented' by hallucinations, resembled hypnotic states.  He decided to preemptively hypnotize her and prompt her to 'talk through' these tormenting phantasies. The symptoms subsided quickly.  The day after a session, she would become 'quite calm' and 'agreeable, obedient, industrious and even in good spirits'. The second day after a session she would be 'increasingly moody, contrary and disagreeable, and this worsened on the third.'  Anna O. named these sessions (in English) the 'talking cure' and 'chimney-sweeping.'  Breuer preferred the more sophisticated 'cathartic procedure.'

Breuer communicated this to his friend Sigmund Freud, who offered to co-author a paper laying out the findings. That paper, titled 'The Psychic Mechanism of Hysterical Phenomena,' first appeared in 1893, but was republished as the first chapter of Freud and Breuer's *Studies on Hysteria* (1895). In it, Freud and Breuer propose a new form of hysteria, called 'traumatic hysteria', which they conjecture is always connected to some traumatic event that evokes the syndrome. They further hypothesize that the traumatic event can be unavailable to the conscious, reflective mind of patient---i.e. be unconscious---yet still be causally responsible for the hysterical symptoms.  Moreover, they hypothesize that making the patient aware of the trauma, via Breuer’s 'cathartic procedure' using hypnosis if necessary, alleviates the hysteria.

##### Freud: The foundation of psychoanalysis

The seeds of psychoanalysis were planted by Charcot and Breuer, but they did not develop into a full-fledged system of Psychiatry until Freud worked independently. Building on his theory of unconscious trauma to explain hysteria, Freud hypothesizes that traumatic events may manifest themselves in the mind indirectly in the form of symbols. He then went on to realize that the fantasy lives of the psychotic are full of such symbols, and recovering the original trauma requires investigation of the mechanisms of symbolization.

It was this realization that gives us the basis for psychoanalysis, for it is this realization that allows Freud to argue that the hallucinations and fantasies experiences by the psychotic are not significantly different from the dreams of the sane. Whereas prior to Freud, dreams and hallucinations were thought to be without meaning, after Freud they were seen as full of symbolic representations, the meanings of which were available empirically through systematic investigation of the mechanisms of psychological representation. Freud's proposed mechanisms are introduced in the &lt;!--\ref{classical}--&gt; section on page &lt;!--\pageref{classical}--&gt; of the game book.

The barrier between the mentally ill and the mentally healthy had been permanently broken. No longer does the theory of psychiatry apply only to those who cannot be helped by medicine. Now the theory applies to everyone: a healthy person could become ill through unhealthy habits of mental representation, and ill people could become healthy through the process of discovering their habits of mental representation and recognizing their unconscious traumas.  

This conflation of psychiatric conditions and normal life left Freud in the precarious position of having to define 'mental illness.'  He did so thus:
&gt; Symptoms—and of course we are dealing now with psychical (or psychogenic) symptoms and psychical illness—are acts detrimental, or at least useless, to the subject's life as a whole, often complained by him as unwelcome and bringing unpleasure or suffering to him. (*Introductory Lectures*, p. 445)

**Neurosis v. Psychosis.** One of the hallmarks of Freud's theory is his thesis that the there is no hard and fast distinction to be made between the mentally ill and the mentally healthy. His *Introductory Lectures* are structured to introduce the reader to psychopathology in everyday life before extending the analysis of common activities to psychotics and neurotic patients.  As such, there are no hard and fast definitions of psychosis and neurosis.

During the course of normal development of mentally healthy adults, the ego must become 'reasonable': it must no longer let “itself be governed by the pleasure principle, but obeys the reality principle, which also at bottom seeks to obtain pleasure, but pleasure which is assured through taking account of reality, even though it is pleasure postponed and diminished.” (p. 444) A neurotic's ego fails to make this transition, and gets stuck at one point in development.  Thus, the neurotic's libido and ego are still struggling in a child-like way, but the contents of the struggle have been transformed into objects of adulthood. Neurotic symptoms are the “outcome of a conflict which arises over a new method of satisfying the libido” (p. 446) and a person is ill from neurosis only if “his ego has lost the capacity to allocate his libido in some way” (p. 480). A psychotic patient, however, has lost the battle for the reality principle, and the libido has created its own reality.

The object of a neurosis, then, is relevant to the diagnosis only insofar as it is a stand-in for the actual conflict by the mechanisms of repression, reaction formation, isolation, etc.  According to Freud: “clinical psychiatry takes little notice of the outward form or content of individual symptoms, but psychoanalysis takes matters up at precisely that point and has established in the first place the fact that symptoms have a sense and are related to the patient's experience.” (p. 318)

See Lectures 22 and 23 of the *Introductory Lectures* for a full discussion of neurosis and its origins.
##### The Clark Lectures

In 1909, G. Stanley Hall, first president of the American Psychological Association, invited Freud and Jung to give a series of lectures at Clark University. The conference itself was a major moment in the intellectual history of America, as such luminaries as William James, Franz Boas, Adolf Meyer and E.B. Tichner were in attendance, as well as the famed Anarchist Emma Goldman.

After the lectures, James Jackson Putnam, a neurologist in New York City, invited Freud and Jung to retire to his family's Adirondack 'great camp' for the weekend.  Putnam became an important advocate for psychoanalysis in the United States, establishing its legitimacy as a treatment for hysteria. While there are articles prior to 1909 on psychoanalysis (notably one by Putnam himself in 1906), we don't find significant discussion of  psychoanalysis in the mainstream journals of Psychology until after the Clark lectures. An effort to convince the American public of the scientific nature of psychoanalysis was mounted by Putnam camp attendees A.A. Brill, founder of the New York Psychoanalytic Society, and Ernest Jones, student of Freud. By 1916, Jones had published 20 articles, notes and reviews in the Journal of Abnormal Psychology offering or advocating for psychoanalysis.

Putnam and Freud went on to become close friends, and Putnam spent much of the rest of his career attempting to professionalize and regularize the practice of psychiatry. He founded the American Psychoanalytic Association (APsaA) in 1911, which is still active today. His posthumously published *Addresses on Psychoanalysis*, which contains a preface by Freud himself, not only seeks to introduce Freudian theory to his scientific community, but also to dispel misunderstanding gained “through the gossip of prejudice and misconception” (Putnam &amp; Jones, 1921, p. 3).

Putnam’s influence here cannot be understated. Putnam introduced psychoanalytic ideas to the budding field of medical neurology. His position as a medical doctor at Harvard gave psychoanalysis legitimacy as a medical practice in America, and his stature in the neurological community helped to assuage any doubts about the lack of a physical basis for the hypothetical entities posited by Freud's structural hypothesis.

The story is not all smooth sailing. In 1916, the Princeton philosopher and psychologist Warren Fite reviewed of Jung's *Psychology of the Unconscious* for *The Nation*, writing that it “presents some five hundred-odd pages of incoherence and obscenity in the form of a psycho-analytic interpretation of the experiences of a sentimental young American woman.” (Fite, 1916) The fact that the United States was at war with Germany didn't help the psychoanalytic cause: Christine Ladd-Franklin, a student of C.S. Peirce and protege of no less than Hermann Helmholtz as well as one of the first women in the APA, called Freud's theory the product of an “undeveloped... German mind.”

What followed is a history of tension between those in the psychological and psychoanalytic communities. Helped by the military's preference for psychoanalysts in the treatment of 'shell-shock' during WWI and 'combat fatigue' in WWII, psychoanalysis gained credibility in the eyes of the American public.

#### Classification of Mental Illness, 1918-1952

In 1917 during its annual meeting in New York, the American Medico-Psychological Association (now the American Psychiatric Association) in cooperation with the National Commission on Mental Hygiene formed a committee on statistics and charged it with creating a guide for classifying mental illness. The resulting document, *Statistical Manual for the Use of Institutions for the Insane*, was published in 1918 and adopted around the nation. It is available freely on google books. The manual outlined 21 medical-psychological categories, displayed in table &lt;!--\ref{table: 1918Classification}--&gt;:

In 1928, the New York Academy of Medicine invited the Public Health Service, the Army and Navy Medical Departments and the American Hospital Association to collaborate on a standard nomenclature of disease. That standard was first published in 1933 as *A Standard Classified Nomenclature of Disease*, generally referred to as *The Standard*, and was widely used until at least the 1960s. In its original form, it used the following ten categories, as displayed in table &lt;!--\ref{table: 1933Classification}--&gt;:

&lt;!-- \begin{longtable}[!t]{ | p{13.8cm}  | }
\hline
0 Diseases due to prenatal influences\\
1 Diseases due to lower plant and animal parasites\\
2 Diseases due to higher plant and animal parasites\\
3 Diseases due to intoxication\\
4 Diseases due to trauma or physical agents\\
5.0 Diseases due to circulatory disturbances\\
5.5 Diseases due to disturbances of innervation or of psychic control\\
6 Diseases due to or consisting of static mechanical abnormality (obstruction; calculus; displacement and gross changes in form etc., due to unknown cause).\\
7 Diseases due to disorders of metabolism, growth or nutrition\\
8 New growths\\
9 Diseases due to unknown or uncertain causes, the structural reaction (generative, infiltrative, inflammatory, proliferate, sclerotic, or reparative) to which is manifest; and hereditary and familial diseases of this nature.\\
X Diseases due to unknown or uncertain causes, the functional reaction to which is alone manifest; and hereditary and familial diseases of this nature.\\ \hline

--&gt;

You may notice that the medical classification is entirely based on the origin or cause of a condition ('Diseases **due to...**’), not the symptoms. In the &lt;!--\ref{table: 1918Classification}--&gt;, classification system, mental diseases are classified by the Freudian terms 'psychosis' and 'neurosis', except for melancholy and dimentia.

During WWII, psychiatrists classified patients according to the standards of the branch of the armed forces for which they worked. In 1943, Brigadier General William C. Menninger issued a bulletin called “Medical 203” that laid the foundations for medical classification of mental illness. The Navy, Army and Veterans affairs branches all used slightly different diagnostic criteria and classifications.

The International Statistical Classification of Diseases (ICD) included a taxonomy of mental disorders for the first time in 1949. Its classification system is displayed in table &lt;!--\ref{table: 1949Classification}--&gt;:

In the interest of unifying these different classification schema, the American Psychiatric Association voted to create the first Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM). The nomenclature committee adapted the Medical 203 bulletin into the DSM and circulated it to a randomly selected sample of the membership (10%). When it was overwhelmingly approved by those who replied, the APA adopted it as the standard for diagnosis in medical treatment of psychological disorders. It is included as Appendix &lt;!--\ref{app: DSMI}--&gt;
The first DSM distinguished between “Disorders caused by or associated with impairment of brain tissue function,” “Mental Deficiency,”  “Disorders of psychogenic origin or without clearly defined physical cause or structural change in the brain” and “Nondiagnostic Terms for Hospital Record.”  This fourth category included “Alcoholic intoxication (simple drunkenness),” and “Dead on admission.”  It is the third category, those without a physical cause, that is of the most interest to us. They are displayed here in table &lt;!--\ref{table: 1952Classification}--&gt;

#### The Rise of Psychopharmacology

Because psychoanalysis tended to be confined to clinical, military settings in the US, a kind of stable truce—the more cynical might even say a 'cold war’---settled over the conflict between behaviorism and psychoanalysis. By and large, psychoanalysis confined itself to the medical setting; while behaviorism confined itself to pure research. There were, no doubt, volleys across the bow of one or the other from time to time. But until Skinner's wide-ranging proposals for behaviorism as social reformation, there were few open hostilities.

Much of the scientific credibility for psychoanalysis turned on its success in treating psychotic patients.  Medical Doctors tend not to worry so much about the putative mechanism of a therapy, so long as that therapy works for the individual patient in question.  It isn't uncommon for a drug to help some small portion of the population and fail with another.  Generalizations to universal laws are uncommon in the practice of medicine, and much the of time the cause of a certain medical condition remains unknown, even if we understand how to cure it (consider cancers like lymphoma, for example). Thus, when psychologists objected that psychoanalysis did not generalize, its mechanisms were untestable, and as a treatment it was highly individualistic, medical practitioners were not overly impressed.  

All of that changed starting in 1955 when Wallace Labs began marketing the world's first popular psychotropic for the treatment of anxiety: *Miltown*. The Wallace Lab claimed that *Miltown* controlled anxiety without reducing mental function, allowing patients to return to their normal lives. It was quickly followed by *Trofranil*, an antidepressant, in 1959; *Librium*, an anti-anxiety medication, in 1960; and *Valium* in 1963. In 1969, the neurologist Oliver Sacks administered a new drug L-DOPA to patients who had been comatose for almost 40 years. They woke up.  His experiences were immortalized in the book and subsequent movie, *Awakenings.*

These drugs did—in short order—what years of psychoanalysis, hypnosis, electro-shock therapy (the decedent of Beard's treatments) and confinement could not: they allowed patients with crippling anxiety to return to normal or close-to-normal functioning.

### Setting the stage for 1971

In 1961, Thomas Langer and Stanley Michael conducted 2-hour interviews with 1,660 individuals chose at random from the streets of New York. This was, in many ways, the first wide-scale study of the psychology of people *not already* seeking treatment for psychological trouble.  Their findings are quite simple: socio-economic status and age explain most of an individual's mental health. 

 The study was revolutionary. As S. H. Kranes of the University of Chicago said "[this study] is a pioneer in obtaining 'objective' information.  Psychiatry is too promote to the philosophical other than the factual." (http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=1161943)

Since the origin of psychiatry, there has been a distinction made between those disorders that can be directly attributable to a biological dysfunction of the brain and those that cannot. The former were classified as 'neurological,' and the latter 'psychiatric.'  It is this inability to find a biological etiology of the disorder defines the domain of psychiatry.

Two major trends are appearing in psychology and psychiatry: 

1. The current psychoanalytic taxonomy of mental states is based on conjectures and assumptions based on a few case studies, and they have not been tested against evidence and observation.

2. Psychiatric disorders must have a physical component, and hence, the line between psychiatry and neurology may be breaking down.

In light of these trends,what will happen to the field of psychiatry?

Double check reference
The story of how Pinel became interested in insanity is frequently retold. Like Newton's apple, it is probably something of a myth, although there may be some core of truth. Here it is, as told by himself in A Treatise on Insanity:
	The loss of a friend, who became insane through excessive love of glory, in 1783, and the ineptitude of pharmaceutic preparations to the mind elated, as his was, with a high sense of its independence, enhanced my admiration of the judicous precepts of the ancients, and made me regret that I had it not then in my power to put them in practice. (p 52)
From a letter by Marx 1846:
	...in 1785, he had the misfortune to lose a young man to whom he was much attached, and whose reason became affected through excessive study and abstinence. This unfortunate person, after his return to his family, became maniacal, one evening he escaped from his father's house into the neighboring forest and was devoured by wolves; a few torn rags were found the following day, and near them a copy of the Phaedra covered with blood.
And by Lisa Appignanesi in 2009:
A shy provincial like himself, the friend had fallen into despair and then 'mania' when his legal aspirations failed to materialize. Unable to help the younger man once he had all but ceased to eat, Pinel had brought him to the Hôtel-Dieu where a treatment of baths and food seemed to restore him. But his worried family intervened and took him home before he was quite well. The youth escaped their hold, fled to the woods and was found dead only after the wolves had got him. (p58)
From a letter of honor, included in Marx 1846: “He who walks in an odoriferous flower-garden, which had formerly been a pestilential swamp, will best be able to appreciate what you effected in madhouses. Formerly an atmosphere almost stifling, damp rooms, the clank of chains, the cries of those under the lash, the hoarse growl of the rough attendants, the desperate frenzy of the ill-used patients; these succeeded by clean apartments, the greatest humanity in personal attentions, and an atmosphere of peace and confidence throughout the whole establishment. (p.210)
See Roberty Fleury's 'Dr. Phillippe Pinel at the Salpêtrière' (1795)
See, e.g p. 3, Section 4, p 134. Also, from the Marx (1846): Every delusion is the result of confused modes of thinking; wrong and crime originate in ignorance.” (p. 212)
Each humour had an associated personality type. Imbalance in a given humour was thought to be the cause of imbalances in mood or personality: people with too much black bile were melancholic, yellow bile choleric (full of energy), blood sanguine (impulsive), and phlegm phlegmatic (emotional). See Aristotle's Problems Bk 3, Section1 Galen's De temperamentis, and Avicenna's The Canon of Medicine for more detail.
The modern reader of A Treatise on Insanity is impressed by the number of times that Pinel stresses these two features of mental illness. We take both of these for granted to such an extent that the work can seem highly repetitive and redundant. But they were radical theses in the late 18th century, and Pinel's thoroughness in covering the topics no doubt reflects the importance of these thesis in his own mind. (Cite Data – number of pages, examples, etc.).
Where’s the list?
And hence, the frequently-used trope of science fiction dating back to Frankenstein that the dead can be brought back to life with electricity.

In his 'History of the Psychiatric Movement', Freud writes: “...It was the case of the young married couple from the far East. The wife was a great sufferer and the husband was impotent, or exceedinly awkward. I head Charcot repeat: “Tâchez donc, je vous assure vous y arriverez.” Brouardel, who spoke less distinctly, must have expressed his astonishment that such symptoms as those of the young wife should have appeared as a result of such circumstances, for Charcot said suddenly and with great vivacity: “Mais, dans de cas pareils, c'est toujours la chose génital, toujours—toujours-toujours.” And while saying that, he crossed his hands in his lap an jumped up and down several times, with the vivacity peculiar to him.” (Freud, 1938, p. 937-938)

We know that George Beard and Silas Wier Mitchell had the same view at this point, and that Freud was familiar with their work on ‘hysteria.’  What is unknown, given that Freud's retelling of this anecdote is based on his memory alone, is the accuracy of this story. It might be the case, and it might just be Freud misattributing a theory he picked up from Beard and Wier Mitchell to his mentor years after the fact.
See, for example, Drellich, Marvin G. “Classical Psychoanalytic School” in Arieti, S. (1974). American handbook of psychiatry (2d ed.). New York,: Basic Books.
I am simplifying here a bit. While Freud is commonly believed to originate the idea that dreams and psychotic hallucinations were best understood on a continuum, the ideas appears in the work of the British associationist Alexander Bain (see, e.g. Bain, A. (1903) Dissertations on Leading Philosophical Topics, Longmans, Green, and Co., New York and Bombay., p. 45)
Label somehow and include in a table.
The distinction between neurosis and psychosis has always been controversial. Consider Pavlov's comment in his 1927 lectures: “Contemporary medicine distinguishes "nervous" and "psychic" disturbances-neuroses and psychoses, but this distinction is, of course, only arbitrary. No real line of demarcation can be drawn between these two groups: it is impossible to imagine a deviation of higher activities from normal without a functional or structural disturbance of the cortex.” (Pavlov, 1927, Lecture 23)

Verbal behavior. By B. F. SKINNER.(The Century Psychology Series.) Pp. viii, 478. New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts, Inc., 1957.

1. A great many linguists and philosophers concerned with language have expressed the hope that their studies might ultimately be embedded in a frame- work provided by behaviorist psychology, and that refractory areas of investi- gation, particularly those in which meaning is involved, will in this way be opened up to fruitful exploration. Since this volume is the first large-scale attempt to incorporate the major aspects of linguistic behavior within a behaviorist frame- work, it merits and will undoubtedly receive careful attention. Skinner is noted for his contributions to the study of animal behavior. The book under review is the product of study of linguistic behavior extending over more than twenty years. Earlier versions of it have been fairly widely circulated, and there are quite a few references in the psychological literature to its major ideas.
The problem to which this book is addressed is that of giving a 'functional analysis' of verbal behavior. By functional analysis, Skinner means identifica- tion of the variables that control this behavior and specification of how they interact to determine a particular verbal response. Furthermore, the controlling variables are to be described completely in terms of such notions as stimulus, reinforcement, deprivation, which have been given a reasonably clear meaning in animal experimentation. In other words, the goal of the book is to provide a way to predict and control verbal behavior by observing and manipulating the physical environment of the speaker.
Skinner feels that recent advances in the laboratory study of animal behavior permit us to approach this problem with a certain optimism, since 'the basic processes and relations which give verbal behavior its special characteristics are now fairly well understood ... the results [of this experimental work] have been surprisingly free of species restrictions. Recent work has shown that the methods can be extended to human behavior without serious modification' (3).1
1 Skinner's confidence in recent achievements in the study of animal behavior and their applicability to complex human behavior does not appear to be widely shared. In many recent publications of confirmedbehaviorists there is a prevailing note of skepticism with regard to the scope of these achievements. For representative comments, see the contribu- tionstoModernlearningtheory(byEstesetal.;NewYork,1954);Bugelski,Psychologyof learning (New York, 1956);Koch, in Nebraskasymposiumon motivation58 (Lincoln, 1956); Verplanck, Learned and innate behavior, Psych. rev. 52.139 (1955). Perhaps the strongest view is that of Harlow, who has asserted (Mice, monkeys, men, and motives, Psych. rev. 60.23-32 [1953])that 'a strong case can be made for the proposition that the importance of the psychological problems studied during the last 15 years has decreased as a negatively accelerated function approaching an asymptote of complete indifference.' Tinbergen, a leading representative of a different approach to animal behavior studies (comparative ethology), concludes a discussion of 'functional analysis' with the comment that 'we may

It is important to see clearly just what it is in Skinner's program and claims that makes them appear so bold and remarkable. It is not primarily the fact that he has set functional analysis as his problem, or that he limits himself to study of 'observables', i.e. input-output relations. What is so surprising is the particular limitations he has imposed on the way in which the observables of behavior are to be studied, and, above all, the particularly simple nature of the 'function' which, he claims, describes the causation of behavior. One would naturally expect that prediction of the behavior of a complex organism (or machine) would require, in addition to information about external stimulation, knowledge of the internal structure of the organism, the ways in which it proc- esses input information and organizes its own behavior. These characteristics of the organism are in general a complicated product of inborn structure, the genetically determined course of maturation, and past experience. Insofar as independent neurophysiological evidence is not available, it is obvious that inferences concerning the structure of the organism are based on observation of behavior and outside events. Nevertheless, one's estimate of the relative im- portance of external factors and internal structure in the determination of be- havior will have an important effect on the direction of research on linguistic
(or any other) behavior, and on the kinds of analogies from animal behavior studies that will be considered relevant or suggestive.
Putting it differently, anyone who sets himself the problem of analyzing the causation of behavior will (in the absence of independent neurophysiological evidence) concern himself with the only data available, namely the record of inputs to the organism and the organism's present response, and will try to describe the function specifying the response in terms of the history of inputs. This is nothing more than the definition of his problem. There are no possible grounds for argument here, if one accepts the problem as legitimate, though Skinner has often advanced and defended this definition of a problem as if it were a thesis which other investigators reject. The differences that arise between those who affirmand those who deny the importance of the specific 'contribution of the organism' to learning and performance concern the particular character and complexity of this function, and the kinds of observations and research necessary for arriving at a precise specification of it. If the contribution of the organism is complex, the only hope of predicting behavior even in a gross way
will be through a very indirect program of research that begins by studying the detailed cha.acter of the behavior itself and the particular capacities of the organism involved.
Skinner's thesis is that external factors consisting of present stimulation and the history of reinforcement (in particular the frequency, arrangement, and withholding of reinforcing stimuli) are of overwhelming importance, and that the general principles revealed in laboratory studies of these phenomena pro- vide the basis for understanding the complexities of verbal behavior. He confi-
now draw the conclusion that the causation of behavior is immensely more complex than was assumed in the generalizations of the past. A number of internal and external factors act upon complex central nervous structures. Second, it will be obvious that the facts at our disposal are very fragmentary indeed'-The study of instinct 74 (Oxford, 1951).
￼28 LANGUAGE, VOLUME 35, NUMBER 1 (1959)
dently and repeatedly voices his claim to have demonstrated that the contri- bution of the speaker is quite trivial and elementary, and that precise prediction of verbal behavior involves only specification of the few external factors that he has isolated experimentally with lower organisms.
Careful study of this book (and of the research on which it draws) reveals, however, that these astonishing claims are far from justified. It indicates, fur- thermore, that the insights that have been achieved in the laboratories of the reinforcement theorist, though quite genuine, can be applied to complex human behavior only in the most gross and superficial way, and that speculative attempts to discuss linguistic behavior in these terms alone omit from con- sideration factors of fundamental importance that are, no doubt, amenable to scientific study, although their specific character cannot at present be precisely formulated. Since Skinner's work is the most extensive attempt to accommodate human behavior involving higher mental faculties within a strict behaviorist schema of the type that has attracted many linguists and philosophers, as well as psychologists, a detailed documentation is of independent interest. The mag- nitude of the failure of this attempt to account for verbal behavior serves as a kind of measure of the importance of the factors omitted from consideration, and an indication of how little is really known about this remarkably complex phenomenon.
The force of Skinner's argument lies in the enormous wealth and range of examples for which he proposes a functional analysis. The only way to evaluate the success of his program and the correctness of his basic assumptions about verbal behavior is to review these examples in detail and to determine the pre- cise character of the concepts in terms of which the functional analysis is pre- sented. ?2 of this review describes the experimental context with respect to which these concepts are originally defined. ??3-4 deal with the basic concepts 'stimulus', 'response', and 'reinforcement', ??6-10 with the new descriptive machinery developed specifically for the description of verbal behavior. In ?5 we consider the status of the fundamental claim, drawn from the laboratory, which serves as the basis for the analogic guesses about human behavior that have been proposed by many psychologists. The final section (?11) will consider some ways in which further linguistic work may play a part in clarifying some of these problems.
2. Although this book makes no direct reference to experimental work, it can be understood only in terms of the general framework that Skinner has developed for the description of behavior. Skinner divides the responses of the animal into two main categories. Respondentsare purely reflex responses elicited by particular stimuli. Operants are emitted responses, for which no obvious stimulus can be discovered. Skinner has been concerned primarily with operant behavior. The experimental arrangement that he introduced consists basically of a box with a bar attached to one wall in such a way that when the bar is pressed, a food pellet is dropped into a tray (and the bar press is recorded). A rat placed in the box will soon press the bar, releasing a pellet into the tray. This state of affairs, resulting from the bar press, increases the strengthof the bar-
￼REVIEWS 29
pressing operant. The food pellet is called a reinforcer;the event, a reinforcing event. The strength of an operant is defined by Skinner in terms of the rate of response during extinction (i.e. after the last reinforcement and before return to the preconditioning rate).
Suppose that release of the pellet is conditional on the flashing of a light. Then the rat will come to press the bar only when the light flashes. This is called stimulus discrimination. The response is called a discriminated operant and the light is called the occasionfor its emission; this is to be distinguished from elicita- tion of a response by a stimulus in the case of the respondent.2Suppose that the apparatus is so arranged that bar-pressing of only a certain character (e.g. duration) will release the pellet. The rat will then come to press the bar in the required way. This process is called response differentiation.By successive slight changes in the conditions under which the response will be reinforced it is pos-
sible to shape the response of a rat or a pigeon in very surprising ways in a very short time, so that rather complex behavior can be produced by a process of successive approximation.
A stimulus can become reinforcing by repeated association with an already reinforcing stimulus. Such a stimulus is called a secondaryreinforcer.Like many contemporary behaviorists, Skinner considers money, approval, and the like to be secondary reinforcers which have become reinforcing because of their associa- tion with food etc.3 Secondary reinforcers can be generalizedby associating them with a variety of different primary reinforcers.
Another variable that can affect the rate of the bar-pressing operant is drive, which Skinner defines operationally in terms of hours of deprivation. His major scientific book, Behavior of organisms, is a study of the effects of food-depriva- tion and conditioning on the strength of the bar-pressing response of healthy mature rats. Probably Skinner's most original contribution to animal behavior studies has been his investigation of the effects of intermittent reinforcement, arranged in various different ways, presented in Behavior of organisms and ex- tended (with pecking of pigeons as the operant under investigation) in the re- cent Schedules of reinforcementby Ferster and Skinner (1957). It is apparently
2InBehavioroforganisms(NewYork,1938),Skinnerremarksthat'althoughacondi- tioned operant is the result of the correlation of the response with a particular reinforce- ment, a relation between it and a discriminative stimulus acting prior to the response is the almost universal rule' (178-9). Even emitted behavior is held to be produced by some sort of
'originating force' (51) which, in the case of operant behavior is not under experimental control. The distinction between eliciting stimuli, discriminated stimuli, and 'originating forces' has never been adequately clarified, and becomes even more confusing when private internal events are considered to be discriminated stimuli (see below).
3 In a famous experiment, chimpanzees were taught to perform complex tasks to receive tokens which had become secondary reinforcers because of association with food. The idea that money, approval, prestige, etc. actually acquire their motivating effects on human behavior according to this paradigm is unproved, and not particularly plausible. Many psychologists within the behaviorist movement are quite skeptical about this (cf. fn. 23). As in the case of most aspects of human behavior, the evidence about secondary reinforce- ment is so fragmentary, conflicting, and complex that almost any view can find some sup- port.
￼30 LANGUAGE, VOLUME 35, NUMBER 1 (1959)
these studies that Skinner has in mind when he refers to the recent advances in the study of animal behavior.4
The notions 'stimulus', 'response', 'reinforcement' are relatively well defined with respect to the bar-pressing experiments and others similarly restricted. Before we can extend them to real-life behavior, however, certain difficulties must be faced. We must decide, first of all, whether any physical event to which the organism is capable of reacting is to be called a stimulus on a given occasion, or only one to which the organism in fact reacts; and correspondingly, we must decide whether any part of behavior is to be called a response, or only one con- nected with stimuli in lawful ways. Questions of this sort pose something of a dilemma for the experimental psychologist. If he accepts the broad definitions, characterizing any physical event impinging on the organism as a stimulus and any part of the organism's behavior as a response, he must conclude that be- havior has not been demonstrated to be lawful. In the present state of our knowledge, we must attribute an overwhelming influence on actual behavior to ill-defined factors of attention, set, volition, and caprice. If we accept the nar- rower definitions, then behavior is lawful by definition (if it consists of responses); but this fact is of limited significance, since most of what the animal does will simply not be considered behavior. Hence the psychologist either must admit that behavior is not lawful (or that he cannot at present show that it is-not at all a damaging admission for a developing science), or must restrict his atten- tion to those highly limited areas in which it is lawful (e.g. with adequate con- trols, bar-pressing in rats; lawfulness of the observed behavior provides, for Skinner, an implicit definition of a good experiment).
Skinner does not consistently adopt either course. He utilizes the experimental results as evidence for the scientific character of his system of behavior, and analogic guesses (formulated in terms of a metaphoric extension of the technical vocabulary of the laboratory) as evidence for its scope. This creates the illusion of a rigorous scientific theory with a very broad scope, although in fact the terms used in the description of real-life and of laboratory behavior may be mere homonyms, with at most a vague similarity of meaning. To substantiate this
4 Skinner's remark quoted above about the generality of his basic results must be under- stood in the light of the experimental limitations he has imposed. If it were true in any deep sense that the basic processes in language are well understood and free of species restric- tions, it would be extremely odd that language is limited to man. With the exception of a few scattered observations (cf. his article, A case history in scientific method, The American psychologist 11.221-33[1956]),Skinneris apparently basing this claim on the fact that quali- tatively similarresultsareobtainedwithbar-pressingofratsandpeckingofpigeonsunder special conditions of deprivation and various schedules of reinforcement. One immediately questions how much can be based on these facts, which are in part at least an artifact trace- able to experimental design and the definition of 'stimulus' and 'response' in terms of 'smooth dynamic curves' (see below). The dangers inherent in any attempt to 'extrapolate' to complex behavior from the study of such simple responses as bar-pressing should be ob- vious, and have often been commented on (cf. e.g. Harlow, op.cit.). The generality of even the simplest results is open to serious question. Cf. in this connection Bitterman, Wodinsky, and Candland, Some comparative psychology, Am. jour. of psych. 71.94-110 (1958), where it is shown that there are important qualitative differences in solution of comparable ele-
mentary problems by rats and fish.

evaluation, a critical account of his book must show that with a literal reading (where the terms of the descriptive system have something like the technical meanings given in Skinner's definitions) the book covers almost no aspect of linguistic behavior, and that with a metaphoric reading, it is no more scientific than the traditional approaches to this subject matter, and rarely as clear and
careful.6
3. Consider first Skinner's use of the notions 'stimulus' and 'response'. In Behavior of organisms (9) he commits himself to the narrow definitions for these terms. A part of the environment and a part of behavior are called stimulus (eliciting, discriminated, or reinforcing) and response, respectively, only if they are lawfully related; that is, if the 'dynamic laws' relating them show smooth and reproducible curves. Evidently stimuli and responses, so defined, have not been shown to figure very widely in ordinary human behavior.6 We can, in the face of presently available evidence, continue to maintain the lawfulness of the relation between stimulus and response only by depriving them of their objective character. A typical example of 'stimulus control' for Skinner would be the response to a piece of music with the utterance Mozart or to a painting with the response Dutch. These responses are asserted to be 'under the control of extremely subtle properties' of the physical object or event (108). Suppose instead of saying Dutch we had said Clashes with the wallpaper, I thoughtyou liked abstractwork, Never saw it before, Tilted, Hanging too low, Beautiful, Hideous, Rememberour camping trip last summer?,or whatever else might come into our minds when looking at a picture (in Skinnerian translation, whatever other responses exist in sufficient strength). Skinner could only say that each of these responses is under the control of some other stimulus property of the physical object. If we look at a red chair and say red, the response is under the control of the stimulus 'redness'; if we say chair, it is under the control of the collection of properties (for Skinner, the object) 'chairness' (110), and similarly for any other response. This device is as simple as it is empty. Since properties are free for the asking
5 An analogous argument, in connection with a different aspect of Skinner's thinking, is givenbyScriveninAstudyofradicalbehaviorism= Univ.ofMinn.studiesinphilosophyof science, Vol. 1. Cf. Verplanck's contribution to Modernlearning theory (283-8) for more general discussion of the difficulties in formulating an adequate definition of 'stimulus' and 'response'. He concludes, quite correctly, that in Skinner's sense of the word, stimuli are not objectively identifiable independently of the resulting behavior, nor are they manipu- lable.VerplanckpresentsacleardiscussionofmanyotheraspectsofSkinner'ssystem, com- menting on the untestability of many of the so-called 'laws of behavior' and the limited scope of many of the others, and the arbitrary and obscure character of Skinner's notion of 'lawful relation'; and, at the same time, noting the importance of the experimental data that Skinner has accumulated.
6 In Behavior of organisms, Skinner apparently was willing to accept this consequence. He insists (41-2) that the terms of casual description in the popular vocabulary are not validly descriptive until the defining properties of stimulus and response are specified, the correlation is demonstrated experimentally, and the dynamic changes in it are shown to be lawful. Thus, in describing a child as hiding from a dog, 'it will not be enough to dig- nify the popular vocabulary by appealing to essential properties of "dogness" or "hiding- ness" and to suppose them intuitively known.' But this is exactly what Skinner does in the book under review, as we will see directly.

(we have as many of them as we have nonsynonymous descriptive expressions in our language, whatever this means exactly), we can account for a wide class of responses in terms of Skinnerian functional analysis by identifying the 'con- trolling stimuli'. But the word 'stimulus' has lost all objectivity in this usage. Stimuli are no longer part of the outside physical world; they are driven back into the organism. We identify the stimulus when we hear the response. It is clear from such examples, which abound, that the talk of 'stimulus control' simply disguises a complete retreat to mentalistic psychology. We cannot pre- dict verbal behavior in terms of the stimuli in the speaker's environment, since we do not know what the current stimuli are until he responds. Furthermore, since we cannot control the property of a physical object to which an individual will respond, except in highly artificial cases, Skinner's claim that his system, as opposed to the traditional one, permits the practical control of verbal be- havior7is quite false.
Other examples of 'stimulus control' merely add to the general mystification. Thus a proper noun is held to be a response 'under the control of a specific person or thing' (as controlling stimulus, 113). I have often used the words Eisenhower and Moscow, which I presume are proper nouns if anything is, but have never been 'stimulated' by the corresponding objects. How can this fact be made compatible with this definition? Suppose that I use the name of a friend who is not present. Is this an instance of a proper noun under the control of the friend as stimulus? Elsewhere it is asserted that a stimulus controls a response in the sense that presence of the stimulus increases the probability of the re- sponse. But it is obviously untrue that the probability that a speaker will pro- duce a full name is increased when its bearer faces the speaker. Furthermore,
7 253 f. and elsewhere, repeatedly. As an example of how well we can control behavior using the notions developed in this book, Skinner shows here how he would go about evok- ing the response pencil. The most effective way, he suggests, is to say to the subject 'Please say pencil' (our chances would, presumably, be even further improved by use of 'aversive stimulation', e.g.holdingaguntohishead).Wecanalso'makesurethatnopencilorwriting instrument is available, then hand our subject a pad of paper appropriate to pencil sketch- ing, and offer him a handsome reward for a recognizable picture of a cat.' It would also be useful to have voices saying pencil or pen and ... in the background; signs reading pencil or pen and ... ; or to place a 'large and unusual pencil in an unusual place clearly in sight'. 'Under such circumstances, it is highly probable that our subject will say pencil.' 'The available techniques are all illustrated in this sample.' These contributions of behav- ior theory to the practical control of human behavior are amply illustrated elsewhere in the book, as when Skinner shows (113-4) how we can evoke the response red (the device suggested is to hold a red object before the subject and say 'Tell me what color this is').
In fairness, it must be mentioned that there are certain nontrivial applications of 'op- erant conditioning' to the control of human behavior. A wide variety of experiments have shown that the number of plural nouns (for example) produced by a subject will increase if the experimenter says 'right' or 'good' when one is produced (similarly, positive attitudes on a certain issue, stories with particular content, etc.; cf. Krasner, Studies of the condi- tioning of verbal behavior, Psych. bull., Vol. 55 [1958],for a survey of several dozen experi- ments of this kind, mostly with positive results). It is of some interest that the subject is usually unaware of the process. Just what insight this gives into normal verbal behavior is not obvious. Nevertheless, it is an example of positive and not totally expected results us- ing the Skinnerian paradigm.

how can one's own name be a proper noun in this sense? A multitude of similar questions arise immediately. It appears that the word 'control' here is merely a misleading paraphrase for the traditional 'denote' or 'refer'. The assertion (115) that so far as the speaker is concerned, the relation of reference is 'simply the probability that the speaker will emit a response of a given form in the presence of a stimulus having specified properties' is surely incorrect if we take the words 'presence', 'stimulus', and 'probability' in their literal sense. That they are not intended to be taken literally is indicated by many examples, as when a response is said to be 'controlled' by a situation or state of affairs as 'stimulus'. Thus, the expression a needle in a haystack 'may be controlled as a unit by a particular type of situation' (116); the words in a single part of speech, e.g. all adjectives, are under the control of a single set of subtle properties of stimuli (121); 'the sentence The boy runs a storeis under the control of an extremely complex stim- ulus situation' (335); 'He is not at all well may function as a standard response under the control of a state of affairs which might also control He is ailing' (325); when an envoy observes events in a foreign country and reports upon his return, his report is under 'remote stimulus control' (416); the statement This is war may be a response to a 'confusing international situation' (441); the suffix -ed is controlled by that 'subtle property of stimuli which we speak of as action-in-the-past' (121) just as the -s in The boy runs is under the control of such specific features of the situation as its 'currency' (332). No characterization of the notion 'stimulus control' that is remotely related to the bar-pressing ex- periment (or that preserves the faintest objectivity) can be made to cover a set of examples like these, in which, for example, the 'controlling stimulus' need not even impinge on the responding organism.
Consider now Skinner's use of the notion 'response'. The problem of identi- fying units in verbal behavior has of course been a primary concern of linguists, and it seems very likely that experimental psychologists should be able to pro- vide much-needed assistance in clearing up the many remaining difficulties in systematic identification. Skinner recognizes (20) the fundamental character of the problem of identification of a unit of verbal behavior, but is satisfied with an answer so vague and subjective that it does not really contribute to its solu- tion. The unit of verbal behavior-the verbal operant-is defined as a class of responses of identifiable form functionally related to one or more controlling variables. No method is suggested for determining in a particular instance what are the controlling variables, how many such units have occurred, or where their boundaries are in the total response. Nor is any attempt made to specify how much or what kind of similarity in form or 'control' is required for two physical events to be considered instances of the same operant. In short, no answers are suggested for the most elementary questions that must be asked of anyone pro- posing a method for description of behavior. Skinner is content with what he calls an 'extrapolation' of the concept of operant developed in the laboratory to the verbal field. In the typical Skinnerian experiment, the problem of identify- ing the unit of behavior is not too crucial. It is defined, by fiat, as a recorded peck or bar-press, and systematic variations in the rate of this operant and its
￼34 LANGUAGE, VOLUME 35, NUMBER 1 (1959)
resistance to extinction are studied as a function of deprivation and scheduling of reinforcement (pellets). The operant is thus defined with respect to a particu- lar experimental procedure. This is perfectly reasonable, and has led to many interesting results. It is, however, completely meaningless to speak of extrapo- lating this concept of operant to ordinary verbal behavior. Such 'extrapolation' leaves us with no way of justifying one or another decision about the units in the 'verbal repertoire'.
Skinner specifies 'response strength' as the basic datum, the basic dependent variable in his functional analysis. In the bar-pressing experiment, response strength is defined in terms of rate of emission during extinction. Skinner has argued8that this is 'the only datum that varies significantly and in the expected direction under conditions which are relevant to the "learning process".' In the book under review, response strength is defined as 'probability of emission' (22). This definition provides a comforting impression of objectivity, which, however, is quickly dispelled when we look into the matter more closely. The term 'proba- bility' has some rather obscure meaning for Skinner in this book.9 We are told, on the one hand, that 'our evidence for the contribution of each variable [to response strength] is based on observation of frequencies alone' (28). At the same time, it appears that frequency is a very misleading measure of strength, since, for example, the frequency of a response may be 'primarily attributable to the frequency of occurrence of controlling variables' (27). It is not clear how the frequency of a response can be attributable to anything BUT the fre- quency of occurrence of its controlling variables if we accept Skinner's view
that the behavior occurring in a given situation is 'fully determined' by the
relevant controlling variables (175, 228). Furthermore, although the evidence for the contribution of each variable to response strength is based on observation of frequencies alone, it turns out that 'we base the notion of strength upon several kinds of evidence' (22), in particular (22-8): emission of the response (particularly in unusual circumstances), energy level (stress), pitch level, speed and delay of emission, size of letters etc. in writing, immediate repetition, and-
a final factor, relevant but misleading-over-all frequency.
Of course, Skinner recognizes that these measures do not co-vary, because
(among other reasons) pitch, stress, quantity, and reduplication may have in-

9And elsewhere. In his paper Are theories of learning necessary?, Skinner considers the
problem how to extend his analysis of behavior to experimental situations in which it is
impossible to observe frequencies, rate of response being the only valid datum. His answer is that 'the notion of probability is usually extrapolated to cases in which a frequency analysis cannot be carried out. In the field of behavior we arrange a situation in which frequencies are available as data, but we use the notion of probability in analyzing or for- mulating instances of even types of behavior which are not susceptible to this analysis' (199). There are, of course, conceptions of probability not based directly on frequency, but I do not see how any of these apply to the cases that Skinner has in mind. I see no way of interpreting the quoted passage other than as signifying an intention to use the word
'probability' in describing behavior quite independently of whether the notion of proba- bility is at all relevant.
￼REVIEWS 35
ternal linguistic functions.'0 However, he does not hold these conflicts to be very important, since the proposed factors indicative of strength are 'fully understood by everyone' in the culture (27). For example, 'if we are shown a prized work of art and exclaim Beautiful!, the speed and energy of the response will not be lost on the owner.' It does not appear totally obvious that in this case the way to impress the owner is to shriek Beautiful in a loud, high-pitched voice, repeatedly, and with no delay (high response strength). It may be equally effective to look at the picture silently (long delay), and then to murmur Beau- tiful in a soft, low-pitched voice (by definition, very low response strength).
It is not unfair, I believe, to conclude from Skinner's discussion of response strength, the 'basic datum' in functional analysis, that his 'extrapolation' of the notion of probability can best be interpreted as, in effect, nothing more than a decision to use the word 'probability', with its favorable connotations of ob- jectivity, as a cover term to paraphrase such low-status words as 'interest', 'intention', 'belief', and the like. This interpretation is fully justified by the way in which Skinner uses the terms 'probability' and 'strength'. To cite just one example, Skinner defines the process of confirming an assertion in science as one of 'generating additional variables to increase its probability' (425), and more generally, its strength (425-9). If we take this suggestion quite literally, the degree of confirmation of a scientific assertion can be measured as a simple function of the loudness, pitch, and frequency with which it is proclaimed, and a general procedure for increasing its degree of confirmation would be, for in- stance, to train machine guns on large crowds of people who have been instructed to shout it. A better indication of what Skinner probably has in mind here is given by his description of how the theory of evolution, as an example, is con- firmed. This 'single set of verbal responses ... is made more plausible- is strengthened-by several types of construction based upon verbal responses in geology, paleontology, genetics, and so on' (427). We are no doubt to inter- pret the terms 'strength' and 'probability' in this context as paraphrases of more familiar locutions such as 'justified belief' or 'warranted assertability', or something of the sort. Similar latitude of interpretation is presumably expected
when we read that 'frequency of effective action accounts in turn for what we may call the listener's "belief" ' (88) or that 'our belief in what someone tells us is similarly a function of, or identical with, our tendency to act upon the verbal stimuli which he provides' (160)."
10Fortunately, 'In English this presents no great difficulty' since, for example, 'relative pitch levels ... are not ... important' (25). No reference is made to the numerous studies of the function of relative pitch levels and other intonational features in English.
11The vagueness of the word 'tendency', as opposed to 'frequency', saves the latter quotationfromtheobviousincorrectnessoftheformer.Nevertheless, agooddealofstretch- ing is necessary. If 'tendency' has anything like its ordinarymeaning, the remarkis clearly false. One may believe strongly the assertion that Jupiter has four moons, that many of Sophocles' plays have been irretrievably lost, that the earth will burn to a crisp in ten million years, etc., without experiencing the slightest tendency to act upon these verbal stimuli. We may, of course, turn Skinner's assertion into a very unilluminating truth by defining 'tendency to act' to include tendencies to answer questions in certain ways, under motivation to say what one believes is true.
￼36 LANGUAGE, VOLUME 35, NUMBER 1 (1959)
I think it is evident, then, that Skinner's use of the terms 'stimulus', 'control', 'response', and 'strength' justify the general conclusion stated in the last para- graph of ?2 above. The way in which these terms are brought to bear on the actual data indicates that we must interpret them as mere paraphrases for the popular vocabulary commonly used to describe behavior, and as having no particular connection with the homonymous expressions used in the description of laboratory experiments. Naturally, this terminological revision adds no ob- jectivity to the familiar 'mentalistic' mode of description.
4. The other fundamental notion borrowed from the description of bar- pressing experiments is 'reinforcement'. It raises problems which are similar, and even more serious. In Behavior of organisms, 'the operation of reinforcement is defined as the presentation of a certain kind of stimulus in a temporal relation with either a stimulus or response. A reinforcing stimulus is defined as such by its power to produce the resulting change [in strength]. There is no circularity about this: some stimuli are found to produce the change, others not, and they are classified as reinforcing and non-reinforcing accordingly' (62). This is a per- fectly appropriate definitionl2for the study of schedules of reinforcement. It is perfectly useless, however, in the discussion of real-life behavior, unless we can somehow characterize the stimuli which are reinforcing (and the situations and conditions under which they are reinforcing). Consider first of all the status of the basic principle that Skinner calls the 'law of conditioning' (law of effect). It reads: 'if the occurrence of an operant is followed by presence of a reinforcing stimulus, the strength is increased' (Behavior of organisms 21). As 'reinforce- ment' was defined, this law becomes a tautology.13 For Skinner, learning is just change in response strength.'4 Although the statement that presence of reinforce- ment is a sufficient condition for learning and maintenance of behavior is vacu- ous, the claim that it is a necessary condition may have some content, depending on how the class of reinforcers (and appropriate situations) is characterized. Skinner does make it very clear that in his view reinforcement is a necessary condition for language learning and for the continued availability of linguistic responses in the adult.15However, the looseness of the term 'reinforcement' as
12 Oneshouldadd,however,thatitisingeneralnotthestimulusassuchthatisreinforc- ing, but the stimulus in a particular situational context. Depending on experimental ar- rangement, a particular physical event or object may be reinforcing, punishing, or un- noticed. Because Skinner limits himself to a particular, very simple experimental arrangement, it is not necessary for him to add this qualification, which would not be at all easy to formulate precisely. But it is of course necessary if he expects to extend his descriptive system to behavior in general.
13This has been frequently noted.
14 See, for example, Are theories of learning necessary? 199. Elsewhere, he suggests that the term 'learning' be restricted to complex situations, but these are not characterized.
16 'A child acquires verbal behavior when relatively unpatterned vocalizations, selec- tively reinforced, gradually assume forms which produce appropriate consequences in a given verbal community' (31). 'Differential reinforcement shapes up all verbal forms, and when a prior stimulus enters into the contingency, reinforcement is responsible for its resulting control ... The availability of behavior, its probability or strength, depends on whether reinforcements continue in effect and according to what schedules' (203-4). Else- where, frequently.

Skinner uses it in the book under review makes it entirely pointless to inquire into the truth or falsity of this claim. Examining the instances of what Skinner calls 'reinforcement', we find that not even the requirement that a reinforcer be an identifiable stimulus is taken seriously. In fact, the term is used in such a way that the assertion that reinforcement is necessary for learning and contin- ued availability of behavior is likewise empty.
To show this, we consider some example of 'reinforcement'. First of all, we find a heavy appeal to automatic self-reinforcement. Thus, 'a man talks to himself ... because of the reinforcement he receives' (163); 'the child is reinforced automatically when he duplicates the sounds of airplanes, streetcars ...' (164);
'the young child alone in the nursery may automatically reinforce his own ex- ploratory verbal behavior when he produces sounds which he has heard in the speech of others' (58); 'the speaker who is also an accomplished listener "knows when he has correctly echoed a response" and is reinforced thereby' (68); think- ing is 'behaving which automatically affects the behaver and is reinforcing be- cause it does so' (438; cutting one's finger should thus be reinforcing, and an example of thinking); 'the verbal fantasy, whether overt or covert, is automati- cally reinforcing to the speaker as listener. Just as the musician plays or composes what he is reinforced by hearing, or as the artist paints what reinforces him visually, so the speaker engaged in verbal fantasy says what he is reinforced by hearing or writes what he is reinforced by reading' (439); similarly, care in problem solving, and rationalization, are automatically self-reinforcing (442-3). We can also reinforce someone by emitting verbal behavior as such (since this rules out a class of aversive stimulations, 167), by not emitting verbal behavior (keeping silent and paying attention, 199), or by acting appropriately on some future occasion (152: 'the strength of [the speaker's] behavior is determined mainly by the behavior which the listener will exhibit with respect to a given state of affairs'; this Skinner considers the general case of 'communication' or 'letting the listener know'). In most such cases, of course, the speaker is not present at the time when the reinforcement takes place, as when 'the artist... is reinforced by the effects his works have upon ... others' (224), or when the writer is reinforced by the fact that his 'verbal behavior may reach over cen- turies or to thousands of listeners or readers at the same time. The writer may not be reinforced often or immediately, but his net reinforcement may be great' (206; this accounts for the great 'strength' of his behavior). An individual may also find it reinforcing to injure someone by criticism or by bringing bad news, or to publish an experimental result which upsets the theory of a rival (154), to describe circumstances which would be reinforcing if they were to occur (165), to avoid repetition (222), to 'hear' his own name though in fact it was not men- tioned or to hear nonexistent words in his child's babbling (259), to clarify or otherwise intensify the effect of a stimulus which serves an important discrim- inative function (416), etc.
From this sample, it can be seen that the notion of reinforcement has totally lost whatever objective meaning it may ever have had. Running through these examples, we see that a person can be reinforced though he emits no response at all, and that the reinforcing 'stimulus' need not impinge on the 'reinforcedperson'
￼38 LANGUAGE, VOLUME 35, NUMBER 1 (1959)
or need not even exist (it is sufficient that it be imagined or hoped for). When we read that a person plays what music he likes (165), says what he likes (165), thinks what he likes (438-9), reads what books he likes (163), etc., BECAUSE he finds it reinforcing to do so, or that we write books or inform others of facts BECAUSE we are reinforced by what we hope will be the ultimate behavior of reader or listener, we can only conclude that the term 'reinforcement' has a purely ritual function. The phrase 'X is reinforced by Y (stimulus, state of af- fairs, event, etc.)' is being used as a cover term for 'X wants Y', 'X likes Y', 'X wishes that Y were the case', etc. Invoking the term 'reinforcement' has no ex- planatory force, and any idea that this paraphrase introduces any new clarity or objectivity into the description of wishing, liking, etc., is a serious delusion. The only effect is to obscure the important differences among the notions being paraphrased. Once we recognize the latitude with which the term 'reinforcement' is being used, many rather startling comments lose their initial effect-for in- stance, that the behavior of the creative artist is 'controlled entirely by the contingencies of reinforcement' (150). What has been hoped for from the psy- chologist is some indication how the casual and informal description of everyday behavior in the popular vocabulary can be explained or clarified in terms of the notions developed in careful experiment and observation, or perhaps replaced in terms of a better scheme. A mere terminological revision, in which a term borrowed from the laboratory is used with the full vagueness of the ordinary vocabulary, is of no conceivable interest.
It seems that Skinner's claim that all verbal behavior is acquired and main- tained in 'strength' through reinforcement is quite empty, because his notion of reinforcement has no clear content, functioning only as a cover term for any factor, detectable or not, related to acquisition or maintenance of verbal beha- vior.'6 Skinner's use of the term 'conditioning' suffers from a similar difficulty. Pavlovian and operant conditioning are processes about which psychologists have developed real understanding. Instruction of human beings is not. The claim that instruction and imparting of information are simply matters of condi- tioning (357-66) is pointless. The claim is true, if we extend the term 'condition- ing' to cover these processes, but we know no more about them after having revised this term in such a way as to deprive it of its relatively clear and ob- jective character. It is, as far as we know, quite false, if we use 'conditioning' in its literal sense. Similarly, when we say that 'it is the function of predication to facilitate the transfer of response from one term to another or from one object to another' (361), we have said nothing of any significance. In what sense is this true of the predication Whales are mammals?Or, to take Skinner's example, what point is there in saying that the effect of The telephoneis out of orderon the listener is to bring behavior formerly controlled by the stimulus out of order under control of the stimulus telephone(or the telephone itself) by a process of simple conditioning (362)? What laws of conditioning hold in this case? Further-
1* Talk of schedules of reinforcement here is entirely pointless. How are we to decide, for example, according to what schedules covert reinforcement is 'arranged', as in thinking or verbal fantasy, or what the scheduling is of such factors as silence, speech, and ap- propriate future reactions to communicated information?

more, what behavior is 'controlled' by the stimulus out of order,in the abstract? Depending on the object of which this is predicated, the present state of motiva- tion of the listener, etc., the behavior may vary from rage to pleasure, from fixing the object to throwing it out, from simply not using it to trying to use it in the normal way (e.g. to see if it is really out of order), and so on. To speak of 'con- ditioning' or 'bringing previously available behavior under control of a new stimulus' in such a case is just a kind of play-acting at science. Cf. also foot- note 43.
5. The claim that careful arrangement of contingencies of reinforcement by the verbal community is a necessary condition for language learning has ap- peared, in one form or another, in many places.'7Since it is based not on actual observation, but on analogies to laboratory study of lower organisms, it is im- portant to determine the status of the underlying assertion within experimental psychology proper. The most common characterization of reinforcement (one which Skinner explicitly rejects, incidentally) is in terms of drive reduction. This characterization can be given substance by defining drives in some way inde- pendently of what in fact is learned. If a drive is postulated on the basis of the fact that learning takes place, the claim that reinforcement is necessary for learning will again become as empty as it is in the Skinnerian framework. There is an extensive literature on the question of whether there can be learning with- out drive-reduction (latent learning). The 'classical' experiment of Blodgett indicated that rats who had explored a maze without reward showed a marked drop in number of errors (as compared to a control group which had not ex- plored the maze) upon introduction of a food reward, indicating that the rat had learned the structure of the maze without reduction of the hunger drive. Drive-reduction theorists countered with an exploratory drive which was re- duced during the prereward learning, and claimed that a slight decrement in errors could be noted before food reward. A wide variety of experiments, with somewhat conflicting results, have been carried out with a similar design.18 Few investigators still doubt the existence of the phenomenon. Hilgard, in his general review of learning theory,'9 concludes that 'there is no longer any doubt but that, under appropriate circumstances, latent learning is demonstrable.'
More recent work has shown that novelty and variety of stimulus are sufficient
17 See, for example, Miller and Dollard, Social learning and imitation 82-3 (New York, 1941), for a discussion of the 'meticulous training' that they seem to consider necessary for a child to learn the meanings of words and syntactic patterns. The same notion is implicit in Mowrer's speculative account of how language might be acquired, in Learningtheoryand personality dynamics, Chapter 23 (New York, 1950). Actually, the view appears to be quite general.
18 For a general review and analysis of this literature, see Thistlethwaite, A critical review of latent learning and related experiments, Psych. bull. 48.97-129 (1951). MacCor- quodale and Meehl, in their contribution to Modernlearning theory,carry out a serious and considered attempt to handle the latent learning material from the standpoint of drive- reduction theory, with (as they point out) not entirely satisfactory results.

to arouse curiosity in the rat and to motivate it to explore (visually), and in fact, to learn (since on a presentation of two stimuli, one novel, one repeated, the rat will attend to the novel one);20that rats will learn to choose the arm of a single-choice maze that leads to a complex maze, running through this being their only 'reward';21that monkeys can learn object discriminations and maintain their performance at a high level of efficiency with visual exploration (looking out of a window for 30 seconds) as the only reward;22and, perhaps most strikingly of all, that monkeys and apes will solve rather complex manipulation problems that are simply placed in their cages, and will solve discrimination problems with only exploration and manipulation as incentives.23In these cases, solving the problem is apparently its own 'reward'. Results of this kind can be handled by reinforcement theorists only if they are willing to set up curiosity, exploration, and manipulation drives, or to speculate somehow about acquired drives24for which there is no evidence outside of the fact that learning takes place in these cases.

Harlow has been particularly insistent on maintaining the inadequacy of physiologically based drives and homeostatic need states for explaining the persistence of motivation and rapidity of learn- ing in primates. He points out, in many papers, that curiosity, play, exploration, and ma- nipulation are, for primates, often more potent drives than hunger and the like, and that they show none of the characteristics of acquired drives. Hebb also presents behavioral and supporting neurological evidence in support of the view that in higher animals there is a positive attraction in work, risk, puzzle, intellectual activity, mild fear and frustration, etc. (Drives and the CNS, Psych. rev. 62.243-54 [1955]).He concludes that 'we need not work out tortuous and improbableways to explain why men work for money, why children learn without pain, why people dislike doing nothing.'
In a brief note (Early recognition of the manipulative drive in monkeys, British journal of animal behaviour3.71-2 [1955]),W. Dennis calls attention to the fact that early investi- gators (Romanes, 1882; Thorndike, 1901), whose 'perception was relatively unaffected by learning theory, did note the intrinsically motivated behavior of monkeys', although, he asserts, no similar observations on monkeys have been made until Harlow's experiments. He quotes Romanes (Animal intelligence [1882])as saying that 'much the most striking fea- ture in the psychology of this animal, and the one which is least like anything met with in other animals, was the tireless spirit of investigation.' Analogous developments, in which genuine discoveries have blinded systematic investigators to the important insights of earlier work, are easily found within recent structural linguistics as well.
24 ThusJ.S.Brown,incommentingonapaperofHarlow'sinCurrenttheoryandresearch in motivation (Lincoln, 1953), argues that 'in probably every instance [of the experiments cited by Harlow] an ingenious drive-reduction theorist could find some fragment of fear, insecurity, frustration, or whatever, that he could insist was reduced and hence was rein- forcing' (53). The same sort of thing could be said for the ingenious phlogiston or ether theorist.

There is a variety of other kinds of evidence that has been offered to challenge the view that drive-reduction is necessary for learning. Results on sensory- sensory conditioning have been interpreted as demonstrating learning without drive-reduction.25Olds has reported reinforcement by direct stimulation of the brain, from which he concludes that reward need not satisfy a physiological need or withdraw a drive stimulus.26The phenomenon of imprinting, long observed by zoologists, is of particular interest in this connection. Some of the most complex patterns of behavior of birds, in particular, are directed towards objects and animals of the type to which they have been exposed at certain critical early periods of life.27Imprinting is the most striking evidence for the innate disposi- tion of the animal to learn in a certain direction, and to react appropriately to patterns and objects of certain restricted types, often only long after the original learning has taken place. It is, consequently, unrewarded learning, though the resulting patterns of behavior may be refined through reinforcement. Acquisition of the typical songs of song birds is, in some cases, a type of imprinting. Thorpe
reports studies that show 'that some characteristics of the normal song have been learnt in the earliest youth, before the bird itself is able to produce any kind of full song'.28The phenomenon of imprinting has recently been investi- gated under laboratory conditions and controls with positive results.29
Phenomena of this general type are certainly familiar from everyday experi- ence. We recognize people and places to which we have given no particular attention. We can look up something in a book and learn it perfectly well with no other motive than to confute reinforcement theory, or out of boredom, or idle curiosity. Everyone engaged in research must have had the experience of working with feverish and prolonged intensity to write a paper which no one else will read or to solve a problem which no one else thinks important and which will bring no conceivable reward-which may only confirm a general opinion that the researcheris wasting his time on irrelevancies. The fact that rats and monkeys do likewise is interesting, and important to show in careful experiment. In fact, studies of behavior of the type mentioned above have an independent and posi- tive significance that far outweighs their incidental importance in bringing into question the claim that learning is impossible without drive-reduction. It is not at all unlikely that insights arising from animal behavior studies with this broadened scope may have the kind of relevance to such complex activities as
verbal behavior that reinforcement theory has, so far, failed to exhibit. In any event, in the light of presently available evidence, it is difficult to see how anyone

can be willing to claim that reinforcement is necessary for learning, if reinforce- ment is taken seriously as something identifiable independently of the resulting change in behavior.
Similarly, it seems quite beyond question that children acquire a good deal of their verbal and nonverbal behavior by casual observation and imitation of adults and other children.30It is simply not true that children can learn language only through 'meticulous care' on the part of adults who shape their verbal repertoire through careful differential reinforcement, though it may be that such care is often the custom in academic families. It is a common observation that a young child of immigrant parents may learn a second language in the streets, from other children, with amazing rapidity, and that his speech may be com- pletely fluent and correct to the last allophone, while the subtleties that become second nature to the child may elude his parents despite high motivation and continued practice. A child may pick up a large part of his vocabulary and 'feel' for sentence structure from television, from reading, from listening to adults, etc. Even a very young child who has not yet acquired a minimal repertoire from which to form new utterances may imitate a word quite well on an early try, with no attempt on the part of his parents to teach it to him. It is also perfectly obvious that, at a later stage, a child will be able to construct and understand utterances which are quite new, and are, at the same time, acceptable sentences in his language. Every time an adult reads a newspaper, he undoubtedly comes upon countless new sentences which are not at all similar, in a simple, physical sense, to any that he has heard before, and which he will recognize as sentences and understand; he will also be able to detect slight distortions or misprints. Talk of 'stimulus generalization' in such a case simply perpetuates the mystery
under a new title. These abilities indicate that there must be fundamental processes at work quite independently of 'feedback' from the environment. I have been able to find no support whatsoever for the doctrine of Skinner and others that slow and careful shaping of verbal behavior through differential re- inforcement is an absolute necessity. If reinforcement theory really requires the
30Of course it is perfectly possible to incorporate this fact within the Skinnerian frame' work. If, for example, a child watches an adult using a comb and then, with no instruction' tries to comb his own hair, we can explain this act by saying that he performs it because he finds it reinforcing to do so, or because of the reinforcement provided by behaving like a person who is 'reinforcing' (cf. 164). Similarly, an automatic explanation is available for any other behavior. It seems strange at first that Skinner pays so little attention to the literature on latent learning and related topics, considering the tremendous reliance that he places on the notion of reinforcement; I have seen no reference to it in his writings. Similarly, Keller and Schoenfeld, in what appears to be the only text written under pre- dominantly Skinnerian influence, Principles of psychology (New York, 1950), dismiss the latent-learning literature in one sentence as 'beside the point', serving only 'to obscure, rather than clarify, a fundamental principle' (the law of effect, 41). However, this neglect is perfectly appropriate in Skinner's case. To the drive-reductionist, or anyone else for whom the notion 'reinforcement' has some substantive meaning, these experiments and observations are important (and often embarrassing). But in the Skinnerian sense of the word, neither these results nor any conceivable others can cast any doubt on the claim that reinforcement is essential for the acquisition and maintenance of behavior. Behavior cer-
tainly has some concomitant circumstances, and whatever they are, we can call them 'reinforcement'.

assumption that there be such meticulous care, it seems best to regard this simply as a reductio ad absurdum argument against this approach. It is also not easy to find any basis (or, for that matter, to attach very much content) to the claim that reinforcing contingencies set up by the verbal community are the single factor responsible for maintaining the strength of verbal behavior. The sources of the 'strength' of this behavior are almost a total mystery at present. Reinforcement undoubtedly plays a significant role, but so do a variety of moti- vational factors about which nothing serious is known in the case of human beings.
As far as acquisition of language is concerned, it seems clear that reinforcement, casual observation, and natural inquisitiveness (coupled with a strong tendency to imitate) are important factors, as is the remarkable capacity of the child to generalize, hypothesize, and 'process information' in a variety of very special and apparently highly complex ways which we cannot yet describe or begin to under- stand, and which may be largely innate, or may develop through some sort of learning or through maturation of the nervous system. The manner in which such factors operate and interact in language acquisition is completely unknown. It is clear that what is necessary in such a case is research, not dogmatic and per- fectly arbitrary claims, based on analogies to that small part of the experimental literature in which one happens to be interested.
The pointlessness of these claims becomes clear when we consider the well- known difficulties in determining to what extent inborn structure, maturation, and learning are responsible for the particular form of a skilled or complex per- formance.3'To take just one example,32the gaping response of a nestling thrush is at first released by jarring of the nest, and, at a later stage, by a moving object of specific size, shape, and position relative to the nestling. At this later stage the response is directed towards the part of the stimulus object corresponding to the parent's head, and characterized by a complex configuration of stimuli that can be precisely described. Knowing just this, it would be possible to con- struct a speculative, learning-theoretic account of how this sequence of behavior patterns might have developed through a process of differential reinforcement, and it would no doubt be possible to train rats to do something similar. However, there appears to be good evidence that these responses to fairly complex 'sign stimuli' are genetically determined and mature without learning. Clearly, the possibility cannot be discounted. Consider now the comparable case of a child imitating new words. At an early stage we may find rather gross correspond- ences. At a later stage, we find that repetition is of course far from exact (i.e.
31Tinbergen (op.cit., Chapter VI) reviews some aspects of this problem, discussing the primary role of maturation in the development of many complex motor patterns (e.g. flying, swimming) in lower organisms, and the effect of an 'innate disposition to learn' in certain specific ways and at certain specific times. Cf. also Schiller, Instinctive behavior 265-88, for a discussion of the role of maturing motor patterns in apparently insightful be- havior in the chimpanzee.
Lenneberg (Language, evolution, and purposive behavior, unpublished) presents a very interesting discussion of the part that biological structure may play in the acquisition of language, and the dangers in neglecting this possibility.

it is not mimicry, a fact which itself is interesting), but that it reproduces the highly complex configuration of sound features that constitute the phonological structure of the language in question. Again, we can propose a speculative ac- count of how this result might have been obtained through elaborate arrange- ment of reinforcing contingencies. Here too, however, it is possible that ability to select out of the complex auditory input those features that are phonologically relevant may develop largely independently of reinforcement, through geneti- cally determined maturation. To the extent that this is true, an account of the development and causation of behavior that fails to consider the structure of the organism will provide no understanding of the real processes involved.
It is often argued that experience, rather than innate capacity to handle in-
formation in certain specific ways, must be the factor of overwhelming dom-
inance in determining the specific character of language acquisition, since a
child speaks the language of the group in which he lives. But this is a superficial
argument. As long as we are speculating, we may consider the possibility that
the brain has evolved to the point where, given an input of observed Chinese
sentences, it produces (by an 'induction' of apparently fantastic complexity and
suddenness) the 'rules' of Chinese grammar, and given an input of observed
English sentences, it produces (by, perhaps, exactly the same process of induc-
tion) the rules of English grammar; or that given an observed application of a term to certain instances it automatically predicts the extension to a class of
complexly related instances. If clearly recognized as such, this speculation is neither unreasonable nor fantastic; nor, for that matter, is it beyond the bounds of possible study. There is of course no known neural structure capable of per- forming this task in the specific ways that observation of the resulting behavior might lead us to postulate; but for that matter, the structures capable of ac- counting for even the simplest kinds of learning have similarly defied detection.38
Summarizing this brief discussion, it seems that there is neither empirical evidence nor any known argument to support any SPECIFIC claim about the relative importance of 'feedback' from the environment and the 'independent contribution of the organism' in the process of language acquisition.
6. We now turn to the system that Skinner develops specifically for the de- scription of verbal behavior. Since this system is based on the notions 'stimulus', 'response', and 'reinforcement', we can conclude from the preceding sections that it will be vague and arbitrary. For reasons noted in ?1, however, I think it is important to see in detail how far from the mark any analysis phrased solely in these terms must be and how completely this system fails to account for the facts of verbal behavior.
Consider first the term 'verbal behavior' itself. This is defined as 'behavior
33Cf. Lashley, In search of the engram, Symposium of the Society for Experimental Biology 4.454-82 (1950). Sperry, On the neural basis of the conditioned response, British journal of animal behaviour3.41-4 (1955),argues that to account for the experimental results
of Lashley and others, and for other facts that he cites, it is necessary to assume that
high-level cerebralactivity of the type of insight, expectancy, etc. is involved even in simple
conditioning. He states that 'we still lack today a satisfactory picture of the underlying neural mechanism' of the conditioned response.
￼REVIEWS 45
reinforced through the mediation of other persons' (2). The definition is clearly much too broad. It would include as 'verbal behavior', for example, a rat pressing the bar in a Skinner-box, a child brushing his teeth, a boxer retreating before an opponent, and a mechanic repairing an automobile. Exactly how much of ordinary linguistic behavior is 'verbal' in this sense, however, is something of a question: perhaps, as I have pointed out above, a fairly small fraction of it, if any substantive meaning is assigned to the term 'reinforced'. This definition is subsequently refined by the additional provision that the mediating response of
the reinforcing person (the 'listener') must itself 'have been conditioned precisely in orderto reinforcethe behavior of the speaker' (225, italics his). This still covers the examples given above, if we can assume that the 'reinforcing' behavior of the psychologist, the parent, the opposing boxer, and the paying customer are the result of appropriate training, which is perhaps not unreasonable. A signifi- cant part of the fragment of linguistic behavior covered by the earlier definition will no doubt be excluded by the refinement, however. Suppose, for example, that while crossing the street I hear someone shout Watch out for the car and jump out of the way. It can hardly be proposed that my jumping (the mediating, reinforcing response in Skinner's usage) was conditioned (that is, I was trained to jump) precisely in order to reinforce the behavior of the speaker. Similarly for a wide class of cases. Skinner's assertion that with this refined definition 'we narrow our subject to what is traditionally recognized as the verbal field' (225) appears to be grossly in error.
7. Verbal operants are classified by Skinner in terms of their 'functional' rela- tion to discriminated stimulus, reinforcement, and other verbal responses. A mand is defined as 'a verbal operant in which the response is reinforced by a
characteristic consequence and is therefore under the functional control of rele- vant conditions of deprivation or aversive stimulation' (35). This is meant to include questions, commands, etc. Each of the terms in this definition raises a host of problems. A mand such as Pass the salt is a class of responses. We cannot tell by observing the form of a response whether it belongs to this class (Skinner is very clear about this), but only by identifying the controlling variables. This is generally impossible. Deprivation is defined in the bar-pressing experiment in terms of length of time that the animal has not been fed or permitted to drink. In the present context, however, it is quite a mysterious notion. No attempt is made here to describe a method for determining 'relevant conditions of depriva- tion' independently of the 'controlled' response. It is of no help at all to be told (32) that it can be characterized in terms of the operations of the experimenter. If we define deprivation in terms of elapsed time, then at any moment a person is in countless states of deprivation.34It appears that we must decide that the relevant condition of deprivation was (say) salt-deprivation, on the basis of the fact that the speaker asked for salt (the reinforcing community which 'sets up'
34Furthermore, the motivation of the speaker does not, except in the simplest cases, correspond in intensity to the duration of deprivation. An obvious counter-example is what Hebb has called the 'salted-nut phenomenon' (Organizationof behavior199 [New York,1949]).Thedifficultyisofcourseevenmoreseriouswhenweconsider'deprivations' not related to physiological drives.
￼46 LANGUAGE, VOLUME 35, NUMBER 1 (1959)
the mand is in a similar predicament). In this case, the assertion that a mand is under the control of relevant deprivation is empty, and we are (contrary to Skinner's intention) identifying the response as a mand completely in terms of form. The word 'relevant' in the definition above conceals some rather serious complications.
In the case of the mand Pass thesalt, the word 'deprivation' is not out of place, though it appears to be of little use for functional analysis. Suppose however that thespeakersaysGivemethebook,Takemeforaride,orLetmefix it.What kinds of deprivation can be associated with these mands? How do we determine or measure the relevant deprivation? I think we must conclude in this case, as before, either that the notion 'deprivation' is relevant at most to a minute frag- ment of verbal behavior, or else that the statement 'X is under Y-deprivation' is just an odd paraphrase for 'X wants Y', bearing a misleading and unjustifiable connotation of objectivity.
The notion 'aversive control' is just as confused. This is intended to cover threats, beating, and the like (33). The manner in which aversive stimulation functions is simply described. If a speaker has had a history of appropriate re- inforcement (e.g. if a certain response was followed by 'cessation of the threat of such injury-of events which have previously been followed by such injury and which are therefore conditioned aversive stimuli') then he will tend to give the proper response when the threat which had previously been followed by the injury is presented. It would appear to follow from this description that a speaker will not respond properly to the mand Your money or your life (38) unless he has a past history of being killed. But even if the difficulties in describing the mechanism of aversive control are somehow removed by a more careful analysis, it will be of little use for identifying operants for reasons similar to those men- tioned in the case of deprivation.
It seems, then, that in Skinner's terms there is in most cases no way to decide whether a given response is an instance of a particular mand. Hence it is meaning- less, within the terms of his system, to speak of the characteristicconsequences of a mand, as in the definition above. Furthermore, even if we extend the system so that mands can somehow be identified, we will have to face the obvious fact that most of us are not fortunate enough to have our requests, commands, advice, and so on characteristically reinforced (they may nevertheless exist in considerable 'strength'). These responses could therefore not be considered mands by Skinner. In fact, Skinner sets up a category of 'magical mands' (48-9) to cover the case of 'mands which cannot be accounted for by showing that they have ever had the effect specified or any similar effect upon similar occasions' (the word 'ever' in this statement should be replaced by 'characteristically'). In these pseudo mands, 'the speaker simply describes the reinforcement appro- priate to a given state of deprivation or aversive stimulation'. In other words, given the meaning that we have been led to assign to 'reinforcement' and 'depri- vation', the speaker asks for what he wants. The remark that 'a speaker appears to create new mands on the analogy of old ones' is also not very helpful.
Skinner's claim that his new descriptive system is superior to the traditional one 'because its terms can be defined with respect to experimental operations'
￼REVIEWS 47
(45) is, we see once again, an illusion. The statement 'X wants Y' is not clarified by pointing out a relation between rate of bar-pressing and hours of food-depri- vation; replacing 'X wants Y' by 'X is deprived of Y' adds no new objectivity to the description of behavior. His further claim for the superiority of the new analysis of mands is that it provides an objective basis for the traditional classi- fication into requests, commands, etc. (38-41). The traditional classification is in terms of the intention of the speaker. But intention, Skinner holds, can be reduced to contingencies of reinforcement, and, correspondingly, we can explain the traditional classification in terms of the reinforcing behavior of the listener. Thus a question is a mand which 'specifies verbal action, and the behavior of the listener permits us to classify it as a request, a command, or a prayer' (39). It is a request if 'the listener is independently motivated to reinforce the speaker'; a command if 'the listener's behavior is ... reinforced by reducing a threat'; a prayer if the mand 'promotes reinforcement by generating an emotional disposi- tion'. The mand is advice if the listener is positively reinforced by the conse- quences of mediating the reinforcement of the speaker; it is a warning if 'by carrying out the behavior specified by the speaker the listener escapes from aversive stimulation'; and so on. All this is obviously wrong if Skinner is using the words 'request', 'command', etc., in anything like the sense of the corre- sponding English words. The word 'question' does not cover commands. Please pass the salt is a request (but not a question), whether or not the listener happens to be motivated to fulfill it; not everyone to whom a request is addressed is favorably disposed. A response does not cease to be a command if it is not fol- lowed; nor does a question become a command if the speaker answers it because of an implied or imagined threat. Not all advice is good advice, and a response does not cease to be advice if it is not followed. Similarly, a warning may be misguided; heeding it may cause aversive stimulation, and ignoring it might be positively reinforcing. In short, the entire classification is beside the point. A moment's thought is sufficient to demonstrate the impossibility of distinguishing between requests, commands, advice, etc., on the basis of the behavior or dis- position of the particular listener. Nor can we do this on the basis of the typical behavior of all listeners. Some advice is never taken, is always bad, etc., and similarly with other kinds of mands. Skinner's evident satisfaction with this analysis of the traditional classification is extremely puzzling.
8. Mands are operants with no specified relation to a prior stimulus. A tact, on the other hand, is defined as 'a verbal operant in which a response of given form is evoked (or at least strengthened) by a particular object or event or property of an object or event' (81). The examples quoted in the discussion of stimulus control (?3) are all tacts. The obscurity of the notion 'stimulus control' makes the concept of the tact rather mystical. Since, however, the tact is 'the most important of verbal operants', it is important to investigate the develop- ment of this concept in more detail.
We first ask why the verbal community 'sets up' tacts in the child-that is, how the parent is reinforced by setting up the tact. The basic explanation for this behavior of the parent (85-6) is the reinforcement he obtains by the fact that his contact with the environment is extended; to use Skinner's example, the
￼48 LANGUAGEV,OLUME35,NUMBER1(1959)
child may later be able to call him to the telephone. (It is difficult to see, then, how first children acquire tacts, since the parent does not have the appropriate history of reinforcement). Reasoning in the same way, we may conclude that the parent induces the child to walk so that he can make some money delivering newspapers. Similarly, the parent sets up an 'echoic repertoire' (e.g. a phonemic system) in the child because this makes it easier to teach him new vocabulary, and extending the child's vocabulary is ultimately useful to the parent. 'In all these cases we explain the behavior of the reinforcing listener by pointing to an improvement in the possibility of controlling the speaker whom he reinforces' (56). Perhaps this provides the explanation for the behavior of the parent in inducing the child to walk: the parent is reinforced by the improvement in his control of the child when the child's mobility increases. Underlying these modes of explanation is a curious view that it is somehow more scientific to attribute to a parent a desire to control the child or enhance his own possibilities for action than a desire to see the child develop and extend his capacities. Needless to say, no evidence is offered to support this contention.
Consider now the problem of explaining the response of the listener to a tact. Suppose, for example, that B hears A say fox and reacts appropriately, looks around, runs away, aims his rifle, etc. How can we explain B's behavior? Skinner rightly rejects analyses of this offered by Watson and Bertrand Russell. His own equally inadequate analysis proceeds as follows (87-8). We assume (1) 'that in the history of [B] the stimulus fox has been an occasion upon which looking around has been followed by seeing a fox' and (2) 'that the listener has some current "interest in seeing foxes"-that behavior which depends upon a seen fox for its execution is strong, and that the stimulus supplied by a fox is therefore reinforcing'. B carries out the appropriate behavior, then, because 'the heard stimulus fox is the occasion upon which turning and looking about is frequently followed by the reinforcement of seeing a fox'; i.e. his behavior is a discriminated operant. This explanation is unconvincing. B may never have seen a fox and may have no current interest in seeing one, and yet may react appropriately to the stimulus fox.35 Since exactly the same behavior may take place when neither of the assumptions is fulfilled, some other mechanism must be operative here.
Skinner remarks several times that his analysis of the tact in terms of stimulus control is an improvement over the traditional formulations in terms of reference and meaning. This is simply not true. His analysis is fundamentally the same as the traditional one, though much less carefully phrased. In particular, it differs only by indiscriminate paraphrase of such notions as denotation (reference) and connotation (meaning), which have been kept clearly apart in traditional formulations, in terms of the vague concept 'stimulus control'. In one tradi- tional formulation a descriptive term is said to denote a set of entities and to connote or designate a certain property or condition that an entity must possess
35Just as he may have the appropriate reaction, both emotional and behavioral, to such utterances as The volcano is erupting or There's a homicidal maniac in the next room without any previous pairing of the verbal and the physical stimulus. Skinner's discussion of Pav- lovian conditioning in language (154) is similarly unconvincing.
￼REVIEWS 49
or fulfil if the term is to apply to it.36Thus the term vertebraterefers to (denotes, is true of) vertebrates and connotes the property 'having a spine' or something of the sort. This connoted defining property is called the meaning of the term. Two terms may have the same reference but different meanings. Thus it is ap- parently true that the creatures with hearts are all and only the vertebrates. If so, then the term creaturewith a heartrefers to vertebrates and designates the property 'having a heart'. This is presumably a different property (a different general condition) from having a spine; hence the terms vertebrateand creature with a heart are said to have different meanings. This analysis is not incorrect (for at least one sense of meaning), but its many limitations have frequently been pointed out.37The major problem is that there is no good way to decide whether two descriptive terms designate the same property.38As we have just seen, it is not sufficient that they refer to the same objects. Vertebrateand creaturewith a spine would be said to designate the same property (distinct from that designated by creaturewith a heart). If we ask why this is so, the only answer appears to be that the terms are synonymous. The notion 'property' thus seems somehow
36 Mill, A system of logic (1843). Carnap gives a recent reformulation in Meaning and synonymy in natural languages, Phil. studies 6.33-47 (1955), defining the meaning (inten- sion) of a predicate 'Q' for a speaker X as 'the general condition which an object y must fulfill in order for X to be willing to ascribe the predicate "Q" to y'. The connotation of an expression is often said to constitute its 'cognitive meaning' as opposed to its 'emotive meaning', which is, essentially, the emotional reaction to the expression.
Whether or not this is the best way to approach meaning, it is clear that denotation, cognitive meaning,and emotive meaning are quite differentthings. The differencesare often obscured in empirical studies of meaning, with much consequent confusion. Thus Osgood has set himself the task of accounting for the fact that a stimulus comes to be a sign for another stimulus (a buzzer becomes a sign for food, a word for a thing, etc.). This is clearly (for linguistic signs) a problem of denotation. The method that he actually develops for quantifying and measuring meaning (cf. Osgood, Suci, Tannenbaum, The measurementof meaning [Urbana, 19571)applies, however, only to emotive meaning. Suppose, for example, that A hates both Hitler and science intensely, and considers both highly potent and 'active', while B, agreeing with A about Hitler, likes science very much, although he con- siders it rather ineffective and not too important. Then A may assign to 'Hitler' and 'sci- ence' the same position on the semantic differential, while B will assign 'Hitler' the same position as A did, but 'science' a totally different position. Yet A does not think that 'Hit- ler' and 'science' are synonymous or that they have the same reference, and A and B may agree precisely on the cognitive meaning of 'science'. Clearly it is the attitude toward the things (the emotive meaning of the words) that is being measured here. There is a gradual shift in Osgood's account from denotation to cognitive meaning to emotive meaning. The confusion is caused, no doubt, by the fact that the term 'meaning'is used in all three senses (and others).

Carnap (op.cit.) presents a very similar idea (?6), but somewhat misleadingly phrased, since he does not bring out the fact that only extensional (referential) notions are being used.

language-bound, and appeal to 'defining properties' sheds little light on questions of meaning and synonymy.
Skinner accepts the traditional account in toto, as can be seen from his defini- tion of a tact as a response under control of a property (stimulus) of some physi- cal object or event. We have found that the notion 'control' has no real sub- stance, and is perhaps best understood as a paraphrase of 'denote' or 'connote' or, ambiguously, both. The only consequence of adopting the new term 'stimulus control' is that the important differences between reference and meaning are obscured. It provides no new objectivity. The stimulus controlling the response is determined by the response itself; there is no independent and objective method of identification (see ?3 above). Consequently, when Skinner defines 'synonymy' as the case in which 'the same stimulus leads to quite different re- sponses' (118), we can have no objection. The responses chair and red made alternatively to the same object are not synonymous, because the stimuli are called different. The responses vertebrateand creaturewith a spine would be con- sidered synonymous because they are controlled by the same property of the object under investigation; in more traditional and no less scientific terms, they evoke the same concept. Similarly, when metaphorical extension is ex- plained as due to 'the control exercised by properties of the stimulus which, though present at reinforcement, do not enter into the contingency respected by the verbal community' (92; traditionally, accidental properties), no objection can be raised which has not already been levelled against the traditional account. Just as we could 'explain' the response Mozart to a piece of music in terms of subtle properties of the controlling stimuli, we can, with equal facility, explain the appearance of the response sun when no sun is present, as in Juliet is [like] the sun. 'We do so by noting that Juliet and the sun have common properties, at least in their effect on the speaker' (93). Since any two objects have indefinitely many properties in common, we can be certain that we will never be at a loss to explain a response of the form A is like B, for arbitrary A and B. It is clear, however, that Skinner's recurrent claim that his formulation is simpler and more scientific than the traditional account has no basis in fact.
Tacts under the control of private stimuli (Bloomfield's 'displaced speech') form a large and important class (130-46), including not only such responses as familiar and beautiful, but also verbal responses referring to past, potential, or future events or behavior. For example, the response There was an elephant at the zoo 'must be understood as a response to current stimuli, including events within the speaker himself' (143).39 If we now ask ourselves what proportion of
39In general, the examples discussed here are badly handled, and the success of the proposed analyses is overstated. In each case, it is easy to see that the proposed analysis, which usually has an air of objectivity, is not equivalent to the analyzed expression. To take just one example, the response I am looking for my glasses is certainly not equivalent to the proposed paraphrases: 'When I have behaved in this way in the past, I have found my glasses and have then stopped behaving in this way', or 'Circumstances have arisen in which I am inclined to emit any behavior which in the past has led to the discovery of my glasses; such behavior includes the behavior of looking in which I am now engaged.' One may look for one's glasses for the first time; or one may emit the same behavior in

the tacts in actual life are responses to (descriptions of) actual current outside stimulation, we can see just how large a role must be attributed to private stimuli. A minute amount of verbal behavior, outside the nursery, consists of such remarks as This is red and Thereis a man. The fact that 'functional analysis' must make such a heavy appeal to obscure internal stimuli is again a measure of its actual advance over traditional formulations.
9. Responses under the control of prior verbal stimuli are considered under a different heading from the tact. An echoicoperantis a response which 'generates a sound pattern similar to that of the stimulus' (55). It covers only cases of immediate imitation.40No attempt is made to define the sense in which a child's echoic response is 'similar' to the stimulus spoken in the father's bass voice; it seems, though there are no clear statements about this, that Skinner would not accept the account of the phonologist in this respect, but nothing else is offered. The development of an echoic repertoire is attributed completely to differential reinforcement. Since the speaker will do no more, according to Skinner, than what is demanded of him by the verbal community, the degree of accuracy in- sisted on by this community will determine the elements of the repertoire, whatever these may be (not necessarily phonemes). 'In a verbal community which does not insist on a precise correspondence, an echoic repertoire may re- main slack and will be less successfully applied to novel patterns'. There is no discussion of such familiar phenomena as the accuracy with which a child will pick up a second language or a local dialect in the course of playing with other children, which seem sharply in conflict with these assertions. No anthropologi- cal evidence is cited to support the claim that an effective phonemic system does not develop (this is the substance of the quoted remark) in communities that do not insist on precise correspondence.
A verbal response to a written stimulus (reading) is called 'textual behavior'.
looking for one's glasses as in looking for one's watch, in which case I am looking for my glasses and I am looking for my watch are equivalent, under the Skinnerian paraphrase. The difficult questions of purposiveness cannot be handled in this superficial manner.
40 Skinner takes great pains, however, to deny the existence in human beings (or parrots) of any innate faculty or tendency to imitate. His only argument is that no one would suggest an innate tendency to read, yet reading and echoic behavior have similar 'dynamic proper- ties'. This similarity, however, simply indicates the grossness of his descriptive categories.
In the case of parrots, Skinner claims that they have no instinctive capacity to imitate, but only to be reinforced by successful imitation (59). Given Skinner's use of the word 'reinforcement', it is difficult to perceive any distinction here, since exactly the same thing could be said of any other instinctive behavior. For example, where another scientist would say that a certain bird instinctively builds a nest in a certain way, we could say in Skin- ner's terminology (equivalently) that the bird is instinctively reinforced by building the nest in this way. One is therefore inclined to dismiss this claim as another ritual introduction of the word 'reinforce'. Though there may, under some suitable clarification, be some truth in it, it is difficult to see how many of the cases reported by competent observers can be handled if 'reinforcement' is given some substantive meaning. Cf. Thorpe, op.cit. 353 f.; Lorenz, King Solomon's ring 85-8 (New York, 1952); even Mowrer, who tries to show how imitation might develop through secondary reinforcement, cites a case, op.cit. 694, which he apparently believes, but where this could hardly be true. In young children, it seems
most implausible to explain imitation in terms of secondary reinforcement.
￼52 LANGUAGE, VOLUME 35, NUMBER 1 (1959)
Other verbal responses to verbal stimuli are called 'intraverbal operants'. Paradigm instances are the response four to the stimulus two plus two or the response Paris to the stimulus capital of France. Simple conditioning may be suf- ficient to account for the response four to two plus two,41but the notion of intra- verbal response loses all meaning when we find it extended to cover most of the facts of history and many of the facts of science (72, 129); all word association and 'flight of ideas' (73-6); all translations and paraphrase (77); reports of things seen, heard, or remembered (315); and, in general, large segments of scientific, mathematical, and literary discourse. Obviously the kind of explanation that might be proposed for a student's ability to respond with Paris to capital of France, after suitable practice, can hardly be seriously offered to account for his ability to make a judicious guess in answering the questions (to him new) What is the seat of the French government?,... the source of the literary dialect?, ... the chief targetof the Germanblitzkrieg?,etc., or his ability to prove a new theorem, translate a new passage, or paraphrase a remark for the first time or in a new way.
The process of 'getting someone to see a point', to see something your way, or to understand a complex state of affairs (e.g. a difficult political situation or a mathematical proof) is, for Skinner, simply a matter of increasing the strength of the listener's already available behavior.42Since 'the process is often exemplified by relatively intellectual scientific or philosophical discourse', Skinner considers it 'all the more surprising that it may be reduced to echoic, textual, or intraverbal supplementation' (269). Again, it is only the vagueness and latitude with which the notions 'strength' and 'intraverbal response' are used that save this from absurdity. If we use these terms in their literal sense, it is clear that understand- ing a statement cannot be equated to shouting it frequently in a high-pitched voice (high response strength), and a clever and convincing argument cannot be accounted for on the basis of a history of pairings of verbal responses.43
41Though even this possibility is limited. If we were to take these paradigm instances seriously, it should follow that a child who knows how to count from one to 100could learn an arbitrary 10 X 10 matrix with these numbers as entries as readily as the multiplication table.
42 Similarly,'theuniversalityofaliteraryworkreferstothenumberofpotentialreaders inclined to say the same thing' (275;i.e. the most 'universal' work is a dictionary of cliches and greetings); a speaker is 'stimulating' if he says what we are about to say ourselves (272); etc.
43Similarly, consider Skinner's contention (362-5) that communication of knowledge or facts is just the process of making a new response available to the speaker. Here the anal- ogy to animal experiments is particularly weak. When we train a rat to carry out some peculiar act, it makes sense to consider this a matter of adding a response to his repertoire. In the case of human communication, however, it is very difficult to attach any meaning to this terminology. If A imparts to B the information (new to B) that the railroads face col- lapse, in what sense can the response Therailroadsface collapsebe said to be now, but not previously, available to B? Surely B could have said it before (not knowing whether it was true), and known that it was a sentence (as opposed to Collapseface railroads the). Nor is there any reason to assume that the response has increased in strength, whatever this means exactly (e.g. B may have no interest in the fact, or he may want it suppressed). It is not clear how we can characterize this notion of 'making a response available' without reducing Skinner's account of 'imparting knowledge' to a triviality.
￼REVIEWS 53
10. A final class of operants, called autoclitics, includes those that are involved in assertion, negation, quantification, qualification of responses, construction of sentences, and the 'highly complex manipulations of verbal thinking'. All these acts are to be explained 'in terms of behavior which is evoked by or acts upon other behavior of the speaker' (313). Autoclitics are, then, responses to already given responses, or rather, as we find in reading through this section, they are responses to covert or incipient or potential verbal behavior. Among the auto- clitics are listed such expressions as I recall, I imagine, for example, assume, let X equal ..., the terms of negation, the is of predication and assertion, all, some, if, then, and, in general, all morphemes other than nouns, verbs, and adjectives, as well as grammatical processes of ordering and arrangement. Hardly a remark in this section can be accepted without serious qualification. To take just one example, consider Skinner's account of the autoclitic all in All swans are white (329). Obviously we cannot assume that this is a tact to all swans as stimulus. It is suggested, therefore, that we take all to be an autoclitic modify- ing the whole sentence Swans are white. All can then be taken as equivalent to always, or always it is possible to say. Notice, however, that the modified sentence Swans are white is just as general as All swans are white. Furthermore, the pro- posed translation of all is incorrect if taken literally. It is just as possible to say Swans are green as to say Swans are white. It is not always possible to say either (e.g. while you are saying something else or sleeping). Probably what Skinner means is that the sentence can be paraphrased 'X is white is true, for each swan X'. But this paraphrase cannot be given within his system, which has no place for true.
Skinner's account of grammar and syntax as autoclitic processes (Chapter 13) differs from a familiar traditional account mainly in the use of the pseudoscientific terms 'control' or 'evoke' in place of the traditional 'refer'. Thus in The boy runs,
the final s of runs is a tact under control of such 'subtle properties of a situation' as 'the nature of running as an activity rather than an object or property of an object'.44 (Presumably, then, in The attemptfails, The difficulty remains, His anxiety increases, etc., we must also say that the s indicates that the object described as the attempt is carrying out the activity of failing, etc.) In the boy's gun, however, the s denotes possession (as, presumably, in the boy's arrival,... story, ... age, etc.) and is under the control of this 'relational aspect of the situation' (336). The 'relational autoclitic of order' (whatever it may mean to call the order of a set of responses a response to them) in The boy runs the store is under the control of an 'extremely complex stimulus situation', namely, that the boy is running the store (335). And in thehat and theshoeis under the control of the property 'pair'. Throughin the dog went throughthe hedgeis under the con- trol of the 'relation between the going dog and the hedge' (342). In general, nouns are evoked by objects, verbs by actions, and so on.
Skinner considers a sentence to be a set of key responses (nouns, verbs, ad- jectives) on a skeletal frame (346). If we are concerned with the fact that Sam

rented a leaky boat, the raw responses to the situation are rent, boat, leak, and Sam. Autoclitics (including order) which qualify these responses, express rela- tions between them, and the like, are then added by a process called 'composi- tion' and the result is a grammatical sentence, one of many alternatives among which selection is rather arbitrary. The idea that sentences consist of lexical items placed in a grammatical frame is of course a traditional one, within both philosophy and linguistics. Skinner adds to it only the very implausible specula- tion that in the internal process of composition, the nouns, verbs, and adjectives are chosen first and then are arranged, qualified, etc., by autoclitic responses to these internal activities.45
This view of sentence structure, whether phrased in terms of autoclitics, syncategorematic expressions, or grammatical and lexical morphemes, is in- adequate. Sheep providewool has no (physical) frame at all, but no other arrange- ment of these words is an English sentence. The sequences furiously sleep ideas green colorless and friendly young dogs seem harmless have the same frames, but only one is a sentence of English (similarly, only one of the sequences formed by reading these from back to front). Struggling artists can be a nuisance has the same frame as marking papers can be a nuisance, but is quite different in sentence structure, as can be seen by replacing can be by is or are in both cases. There are many other similar and equally simple examples. It is evident that more is involved in sentence structure than insertion of lexical items in grammatical frames; no approach to language that fails to take these deeper processes into account can possibly achieve much success in accounting for actual linguistic behavior.
11. The preceding discussion covers all the major notions that Skinner intro-
duces in his descriptive system. My purpose in discussing the concepts one by one was to show that in each case, if we take his terms in their literal meaning, the description covers almost no aspect of verbal behavior, and if we take them metaphorically, the description offers no improvement over various traditional formulations. The terms borrowed from experimental psychology simply lose their objective meaning with this extension, and take over the full vagueness of ordinary language. Since Skinner limits himself to such a small set of terms for paraphrase, many important distinctions are obscured. I think that this analysis supports the view expressed in ?1 above, that elimination of the independent contribution of the speaker and learner (a result which Skinner considers of great importance, cf. 311-2) can be achieved only at the cost of eliminating all significance from the descriptive system, which then operates at a level so gross and crude that no answers are suggested to the most elementary questions.46
46 One might just as well argue that exactly the opposite is true. The study of hesitation pauses has shown that these tend to occur before the large categories-noun, verb, adjec- tive; this finding is usually described by the statement that the pauses occur where there is maximum uncertainty or information. Insofar as hesitation indicates on-going composi- tion (if it does at all), it would appear that the 'key responses' are chosen only after the 'grammatical frame'. Cf. C. E. Osgood, unpublished paper; Goldman-Eisler, Speech analy- sis and mental processes, Language and speech 1.67 (1958).

￼REVIEWS 55
The questions to which Skinner has addressed his speculations are hopelessly premature. It is futile to inquire into the causation of verbal behavior until much more is known about the specific character of this behavior; and there is little point in speculating about the process of acquisition without much better understanding of what is acquired.
Anyone who seriously approaches the study of linguistic behavior, whether linguist, psychologist, or philosopher, must quickly become aware of the enor- mous difficulty of stating a problem which will define the area of his investiga- tions, and which will not be either completely trivial or hopelessly beyond the range of present-day understanding and technique. In selecting functional analysis as his problem, Skinner has set himself a task of the latter type. In an extremely interesting and insightful paper,47K. S. Lashley has implicitly delimited a class of problems which can be approached in a fruitful way by the linguist and psychologist, and which are clearly preliminary to those with which Skinner is concerned. Lashley recognizes, as anyone must who seriously con- siders the data, that the composition and production of an utterance is not simply a matter of stringing together a sequence of responses under the control of outside stimulation and intraverbal association, and that the syntactic organi- zation of an utterance is not something directly represented in any simple way in the physical structure of the utterance itself. A variety of observations lead him to conclude that syntactic structure is 'a generalized pattern imposed on the specific acts as they occur', and that 'a consideration of the structure of the
sentence and other motor sequences will show ... that there are, behind the overtly expressed sequences, a multiplicity of integrative processes which can only be inferred from the final results of their activity'. He also comments on the great difficulty of determining the 'selective mechanisms' used in the actual construction of a particular utterance.
Although present-day linguistics cannot provide a precise account of these integrative processes, imposed patterns, and selective mechanisms, it can at least set itself the problem of characterizing these completely. It is reasonable to regard the grammar of a language L ideally as a mechanism that provides
what stimuli are in 'control' in a specific case? When are stimuli 'similar'? And so on. (It is not interesting to be told e.g. that we say Stop to an automobile or billiard ball because they are sufficiently similar to reinforcing people [46].)
The use of unanalyzed notions like 'similar' and 'generalization' is particularly dis- turbing, since it indicates an apparent lack of interest in every significant aspect of the learning or the use of language in new situations. No one has ever doubted that in some sense, language is learned by generalization, or that novel utterances and situations are in some way similar to familiar ones. The only matter of serious interest is the specific 'simi- larity'. Skinner has, apparently, no interest in this. Keller and Schoenfeld (op.cit.) proceed to incorporate these notions (which they identify) into their Skinnerian 'modernobjective psychology' by defining two stimuli to be similar when 'we make the same sort of response to them' (124;but when are responses of the 'same sort'?). They do not seem to notice that this definition converts their 'principle of generalization' (116), under any reasonable in- terpretation of this, into a tautology. It is obvious that such a definition will not be of much help in the study of language learning or construction of new responses in appropriate situations.

an enumeration of the sentences of L in something like the way in which a deduc- tive theory gives an enumeration of a set of theorems. ('Grammar', in this sense of the word, includes phonology.) Furthermore, the theory of language can be regarded as a study of the formal properties of such grammars, and, with a precise enough formulation, this general theory can provide a uniform method for determining, from the process of generation of a given sentence, a structural description which can give a good deal of insight into how this sentence is used and understood. In short, it should be possible to derive from a properly formu- lated grammar a statement of the integrative processes and generalized patterns imposed on the specific acts that constitute an utterance. The rules of a gram- mar of the appropriate form can be subdivided into the two types, optional and obligatory; only the latter must be applied in generating an utterance. The optional rules of the grammar can be viewed, then, as the selective mechanisms involved in the production of a particular utterance. The problem of specifying these integrative processes and selective mechanisms is nontrivial and not be- yond the range of possible investigation. The results of such a study might, as Lashley suggests, be of independent interest for psychology and neurology (and conversely). Although such a study, even if successful, would by no means answer the major problems involved in the investigation of meaning and the causation of behavior, it surely will not be unrelated to these. It is at least possible, fur- thermore, that such notions as 'semantic generalization', to which such heavy appeal is made in all approaches to language in use, conceal complexities and specific structure of inference not far different from those that can be studied and exhibited in the case of syntax, and that consequently the general character of the results of syntactic investigations may be a corrective to oversimplified approaches to the theory of meaning.
The behavior of the speaker, listener, and learner of language constitutes, of course, the actual data for any study of language. The construction of a grammar which enumerates sentences in such a way that a meaningful structural descrip- tion can be determined for each sentence does not in itself provide an account of this actual behavior. It merely characterizes abstractly the ability of one who has mastered the language to distinguish sentences from nonsentences, to understand new sentences (in part), to note certain ambiguities, etc. These are very remarkable abilities. We constantly read and hear new sequences of words, recognize them as sentences, and understand them. It is easy to show that the new events that we accept and understand as sentences are not related to those with which we are familiar by any simple notion of formal (or semantic or sta- tistical) similarity or identity of grammatical frame. Talk of generalization in this case is entirely pointless and empty. It appears that we recognize a new item as a sentence not because it matches some familiar item in any simple way, but because it is generated by the grammar that each individual has somehow and in some form internalized. And we understand a new sentence, in part, because we are somehow capable of determining the process by which this sentence is derived in this grammar.
Suppose that we manage to construct grammars having the properties out- lined above. We can then attempt to describe and study the achievement of the speaker, listener, and learner. The speaker and the listener, we must assume,
￼REVIEWS 57
have already acquired the capacities characterized abstractly by the grammar. The speaker's task is to select a particular compatible set of optional rules. If we know, from grammatical study, what choices are available to him and what conditions of compatibility the choices must meet, we can proceed meaningfully to investigate the factors that lead him to make one or another choice. The listener (or reader) must determine, from an exhibited utterance, what optional rules were chosen in the construction of the utterance. It must be admitted that the ability of a human being to do this far surpasses our present understanding. The child who learns a language has in some sense constructed the grammar for himself on the basis of his observation of sentences and nonsentences (i.e. cor- rections by the verbal community). Study of the actual observed ability of a speaker to distinguish sentences from nonsentences, detect ambiguities, etc., apparently forces us to the conclusion that this grammar is of an extremely com- plex and abstract character, and that the young child has succeeded in carrying out what from the formal point of view, at least, seems to be a remarkable type of theory construction. Furthermore, this task is accomplished in an astonish- ingly short time, to a large extent independently of intelligence, and in a com- parable way by all children. Any theory of learning must cope with these facts.
It is not easy to accept the view that a child is capable of constructing an extremely complex mechanism for generating a set of sentences, some of which he has heard, or that an adult can instantaneously determine whether (and if so, how) a particular item is generated by this mechanism, which has many of the properties of an abstract deductive theory. Yet this appears to be a fair description of the performance of the speaker, listener, and learner. If this is correct, we can predict that a direct attempt to account for the actual behavior of speaker, listener, and learner, not based on a prior understanding of the struc-
ture of grammars, will achieve very limited success. The grammar must be re- garded as a component in the behavior of the speaker and listener which can only be inferred, as Lashley has put it, from the resulting physical acts. The fact that all normal children acquire essentially comparable grammars of great complexity with remarkable rapidity suggests that human beings are somehow specially designed to do this, with data-handling or 'hypothesis-formulating' ability of unknown character and complexity.48The study of linguistic structure
48 There is nothing essentially mysterious about this. Complex innate behavior patterns and innate 'tendencies to learn in specific ways' have been carefully studied in lower or- ganisms. Many psychologists have been inclined to believe that such biological structure will not have an important effect on acquisition of complex behavior in higher organisms, but I have not been able to find any serious justification for this attitude. Some recent studies have stressed the necessity for carefully analyzing the strategies available to the organism, regarded as a complex 'information-processing system' (cf. Bruner, Goodnow, andAustin,Astudyofthinking[NewYork,1956];Newell,Shaw,andSimon,Elementsofa theory of human problem solving, Psych. rev. 65.151-66 [1958]), if anything significant is to be said about the character of human learning. These may be largely innate, or devel- oped by early learning processes about which very little is yet known. (But see Harlow, The formation of learning sets, Psych. rev. 56.51-65 (1949), and many later papers, where strik- ing shifts in the character of learning are shown as a result of early training; also Hebb, Organizationof behavior109ff.) They are undoubtedly quite complex. Cf. Lenneberg, op.cit., and Lees, review of Chomsky's Syntactic structuresin Lg. 33.406f. (1957), for discussion of
the topics mentioned in this section.

may ultimately lead to some significant insights into this matter. At the moment the question cannot be seriously posed, but in principle it may be possible to study the problem of determining what the built-in structure of an information- processing (hypothesis-forming) system must be to enable it to arrive at the grammar of a language from the available data in the available time. At any rate, just as the attempt to eliminate the contribution of the speaker leads to a
'mentalistic' descriptive system that succeeds only in blurring important tradi- tional distinctions, a refusal to study the contribution of the child to language learning permits only a superficial account of language acquisition, with a vast and unanalyzed contribution attributed to a step called 'generalization' which in fact includes just about everything of interest in this process. If the study of language is limited in these ways, it seems inevitable that major aspects of verbal behavior will remain a mystery.
The measurement of meaning. By CHARLESE. OSGOOD,GEORGEJ. SUCI, and PERCYH. TANNENBAUM.Pp. [vii], 342. Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 1957.
ReviewedbyJOHNB.CARROLLH,arvardUniversity
The title of this book provides scant indication of the wide-angle view which the authors have given of a variety of subjects in psycholinguistics and the study of communication processes in both their theoretical and their practical aspects. One can find a little of everything, from pure psychological theory (in the tradi- tion of Clark L. Hull), personality theory, and attitude research, to journalism and advertising. All this is by way of presenting the rationale and the uses of the measuring technique which Osgood has called the semantic differential (here- after SD). Linguists will be most concerned to learn how the authors have dealt with what they call meaning and how the SD can aid in the development of the branch of linguistics which is covered by the widely used and misused term semantics.
Both in the introduction and towards the close of the book (318) the reader is warned that it represents largely a 'progress report'; he is asked therefore to discount the 'tone of assurance not actually felt'. Certainly he cannot but admire the energy and imagination with which the studies described in this volume have been pursued; he will take note of the fact that psychologists here, there, and everywhere have been quick to adopt the SD as a tool of broad usefulness.' But he will ponder. Indeed, the authors predict (320) that he will raise ques- tions-about whether the SD is really a measure of 'meaning', about whether there are really only three main dimensions of the 'semantic space', and about how much the results of SD research can contribute to our understanding of the nature of meaning.

APA has previously developed and instituted policies recognizing and supporting the special mental health issues of minority populations; however, there are serious threats to affirmative action programs that have facilitated the following endeavors: APA reaffirms these commitments and policies by 1) issuing a public statement drawing attention to the potential deleterious effects that such threats pose to the delivery of health services to minority groups; 2) actively participating with other professional and educational groups to assure continued recruitment and training of minority candidates in medical disciplines; and 3) further exploring and developing, through its appropriate components, mechanisms to assure continued implementation of these commitments.

We will also touch on certain factors which may affect the com- petence and also the vocational choice of numbers of college students. We will then proceed to ex- amine briefly trends in the demand for scientific and professional work in the field of mental health. Finally, we will present data on manpower sup-
plies in each of the fields.
THE CRISIS IN EDUCA TION
When we look at enrollment trends in higher edu- cation in the United States, two factors stand out. First, we are wasting enormous amounts of brain power because so many of our bright young people do not receive the training for which they are in- tellectually competent. The shortage of students now finishing college, together with certain other conditions we will mention, means that our coun- try is faced for the next few years with a severe shortage of students in graduate and professional schools. Second, because of a marked rise in the birth rate beginning in the 1940's, we can expect a substantial rise in college enrollments within the
next decade. While this prospect of increasing en- rollments may appear to offer an eventual solution to the problem of shortages, we must keep in mind the increase in the country's population which will create greater demands for professional services. There is real danger that our educational system

facets of our problem in higher education.
Current shortages. A large proportion of bright young people in our society, for one reason or an- other, drop out of school before completing the twelfth grade. Of those who finish high school, many who have the ability to enter college do not enroll. Of those who do begin college, many do not graduate. Wolfle (38) tells us that of the brightest fifth of our young people only one-third finish col- lege. Even among the most able one per cent of our young people, less than two-thirds finish college. The proportion of students with lesser, but ade- quate, ability who finish college is correspondingly
lower.
The number of college graduates is dependent on
the number who are able scholastically and finan- cially to enroll, of course, but also this number is dependent on how many young people of college age there are in the population. This means that, other things being equal, the number of freshman college students is directly related to the number of babies born some eighteen years before. For the past eight years those reaching college age were born in the 1930's when there was an ebb in the na- tional birth rate. There was an artificial rise in enrollment for several years after the war, but for the past few years the number of college graduates has been falling. In all probability we have now
nearly reached the lowest point in numbers of col- lege graduates, and the curve will begin to rise, slowly for a time and then more rapidly.
What do these facts mean for graduate and pro- fessional education? For one thing, they mean that there are fewer college graduates now than at any time in the past five years, and that this small pool of college graduates will rise only slowly for the next decade. This is serious because it means
57

that there are, and will be, fewer students to go around to fill places in graduate and professional schools at a time when there is great social pres- sure to expand training programs.
One of the main reasons for the well-publicized shortage of engineers, teachers, scientists, and tech- nicians is to be found in this short supply of col- lege graduates. Naturally, the shortage also af- fects the recruitment of students by schools train- ing personnel in the mental health professions.
A corollary effect concerns student quality. The elementary fact is that a decrease in the pool of prospective advanced students means increased competition among professions and among profes- sional schools for the fewer college graduates, with the result that admissions standards are sometimes lowered in order to keep vacancies from developing beyond acceptable limits.
A final factor influencing the potential pool of advanced students is the present high prosperity level. We have all seen the pictures of industry representatives bidding for science and mathematics bachelors, and we have read the advertisements for science majors and technicians in our newspapers. But the job market is good for other college gradu- ates as well. Many new college graduates who, in leaner years, might go on to graduate or profes- sional school are swept off their feet by the pros-

pect of an early and painless short cut to suburbia. Prospects for the future. Educators are losing sleep over the steadily swelling enrollments in the elementary schools and are trying desperately to patch the seams of bursting schools while they re- cruit hastily retreaded teachers to fill in the second shifts (48). Although many able students drop out along the way the large increase in school en- rollments means that more students are now reach-
ing high school than ever before.
The trend over the years has been for more and
more high school graduates to enroll in college. At the beginning of the present century only one high school graduate in twenty started college. Today, roughly a third enroll in institutions of higher edu- cation. The American Council on Education (1) predicts that this trend will continue to increase and quotes the American Association of College Registrars and Admission Officers as predicting the proportion will reach SOper cent in the next dec- ade. Two years ago the American Council on Edu- cation (32) had this to say: "If added to the 70 per cent increase in number of college-age youth, we continue to admit into our colleges and universi- ties an increasing percentage of high school gradu- ates, we shall enroll in higher institutions in 1970, at least twice our present number of students."

graduates (in smaller scale) for the past fifteen

years and for the next ten years. It will be ap-
parent from this figure that the drop in numbers of college graduates from the postwar peak is deceler- ating and that the curve will soon turn upward (with a four-year lag) to follow the rising number of high school graduates.
However optimistic this trend toward increased college enrollments appears, the fact remains that we could, if we chose, take steps to encourage large numbers of bright young people who now drop out before finishing high school to stay and graduate. This would still further increase future college en- rollments. We could, if we made a massive effort, nearly quadruple rather than double the number of college students by 1970, without any sacrifice in quality.
As the situation stands, our colleges and universi- ties, experiencing relatively lean years since the ebbing of the flood of students following the war, look with mixed feelings at the gradually rising numbers of freshmen now reaching the campuses. Looking ahead, institutions of higher education have, understandably, some satisfaction in antici- pating the oncoming tide as a source of increased income from tuition. But they see too the prob- lems to be faced in trying to educate students with, in too many cases, broad gaps in their preparation for college, especially in the areas of mathematics and the sciences (13, 49, 50). More importantly perhaps, the faculties who stand ready to face the doubled classes have been weakened by the loss of many of their number to the financial lures and fringe benefits of industry and government service
(13).
To make the massive effort required to give edu-
cational opportunities to all those who are intel- lectually qualified, would require tremendous ex- pansion and improvement of the whole educational system.

THE DEMAND FOR TRAINED PERSONNEL IN THE FIELD OF MENTAL HEALTH
There is no simple way to assess the present na- tional shortages of trained personnel in the mental health professions. A number of estimates has been made for the separate professions and we will present some of these later.
From time to time a spokesman for one of the mental health professions, or an official of a mental health movement, or a foundation concerned with large social problems, speaks out about "the prob- lem of mental illness." Usually, figures are quoted. Somehow, in this age, we have become blase or bored with figures. Yet no one has found a better way to describe the dimensions of the problem. We all know, by now, that of every ten babies born this year, one will spend some time in a mental in- stitution (24). We know that the Federal govern- ment is spending more for the care and support of psychiatric casualties among veterans than all the states combined are spending on the hospitalization of nonveterans (43), and yet we realize that the cost of our present care of people in state institu- tions, even though grossly inadequate, runs as high as one-third of the operating budget of some large and wealthy states (17). And we know that for every one of our 700,000 mental hospital inmates, there is in the community another serious case for whom there is no bed (17).
The demand for mental health personnel is not limited, of course, to those people whose disorders require separation from society. There are other vast numbers of seriously maladjusted people who need help, directly or indirectly. One in five young men of military age will enter the service with a juvenile court record; a million of our citizens are severe, chronic alcoholics, not to mention the prob- lem drinkers; one in four of our marriages will end in divorce; untold numbers suffer from incapaci- tating neuroses or emotionally aggravated physical illnesses.
Perhaps we have quoted enough figures to give some indication of the dimensions of the present problem. For the future, the prospects are even grimmer.
As our population increases, the number of first admissions to state hospitals increases. We have, it is true, stepped up somewhat the rate of dis- charges from our mental institutions over the past twenty years (Figure 2), but any ground gained

thereby is lost by the increasing rate of mental dis- order in the population (Figure 3). We chose these data on admissions and discharges to state hospitals because they were easily available. But we can be quite sure that there are similar in- creases in the neuroses, in alcoholism, and in other forms of disorder as well.
So far, we have only quoted data which indicate the numbers of people who need, or will need, pro- fessional help. But if we are to avoid an endless treadmill, it will be apparent that an even more basic need is for research personnel. At present,
less than one per cent of our total expendituresin the field of mental disorder goes into research (25). Yet research offers the only hope for eventual relief of a share of this problem. Research means highly trained people, and again we meet a demand for personnel.
Let us now look at the supply of people avail- able for work in the mental health fields.
PSYCHIATRISTS
There are, roughly, ten thousand psychiatrists in the United States. Everyone agrees that this is not

 nearly enough. For the country as a whole, there is one psychiatrist for every sixteen thousand peo- ple. Clearly this is an alarming ratio. In 1953 a Congressional Inquiry on Mental Illness (45) con- cluded with the judgment that we need twice as many psychiatrists at once. There is little reason to believe that we shall find them. Blain (3) points out that after allowing for loss due to death and retirement from the field, we are presently gaining about 450 psychiatrists a year. At this rate, he figures that it will be twenty years before we double the number of psychiatrists in this country. But as our population continues to grow too, and as the rate of mental disorder in the population continues to increase (Figure 3), the need rises along with the supply of psychiatrists.
There are facts which make Blain's figures on our rate of gain in psychiatry cause for even more con- cern. Gorman (17) calls attention to the follow- ing: "Of the approximately 450 doctors [each year] who complete the three-year psychiatric residency, an average of 250 go into private practice. This leaves public psychiatry with about 200 recruits, little more than enough to replace the older psy- chiatrists who die off or retire."
There is a further effect of the tendency of the new psychiatrist to go into private practice show- ing up in the shortage of research personnel in psychiatry. Research in psychiatry requires even
further specialized training and experience. The Group for the Advancement of Psychiatry (18) notes that: "Despite increased facilities and sums available for research in psychiatry, the present trend of psychiatric trainees is to enter into the private practice of psychiatry, with emphasis on psychotherapy and the shock therapies, rather than to undertake research."
There is another pessimistic factor to be con- sidered. A sizable number (20 per cent to 25 per cent—see below) of residents in psychiatry are non- resident aliens who return home after their train- ing, reducing still further the number of psychia- trists available for public institutions and agencies.
It is clear that we cannot help but fall behind even the present inadequate psychiatrist-patient ratios in our public institutions. One result is that, as states appropriate more funds to their depart- ments of mental health, they begin to compete with each other for personnel. Time (47) quotes Indi- ana's Governor Craig: "Eventually we will have to stop this bidding against each other. There has to be some common ground of salaries and mutual consideration. . . . These interstate raids on men- tal-health institutions for personnel sometimes get to be like the raids to build up rival football teams."
In some areas of the country the shortage of psychiatrists is much more acute than the national average. Felix (12) has called attention to the

situation in the southern region where a survey of sixteen states indicates an immediate need for five times as many psychiatrists as are presently available.
What possible approaches are there to alleviat- ing this critical shortage? Among those most often mentioned is the suggestion that we expand our programs for training psychiatrists, and attract more physicians, especially new medical school graduates, into the field.
What are our chances of increasing, really sig- nificantly, the number of psychiatrists in relation to our need for psychiatric service?
The supply of psychiatrists is linked in a very real sense to the supply of physicians, and to the number of young physicians who decide to spe- cialize in psychiatry. Despite strenuous efforts made in recent years to encourage more young physicians to enter into psychiatric residencies, there has been no proportionate increase and, in fact, there has been some ground lost in the past three years. Figure 4 shows the total number of residencies offered in four important medical spe- cialties over the past few years, and indicates no relative gain by psychiatry. For many years the proportion of physicians indicating a limited spe- cialty in psychiatry has remained quite constant between the limits of 54 per cent to 7 per cent (36).

NEUROLOGY [BOTH
Another indication of the fairly level output of 125.8 per cent. In 1910 there were 3,165 physi-
trained psychiatrists is the number who pass the examinations of the American Board of Examiners in Psychiatry and Neurology each year. Figure 5 illustrates these figures and also shows the even lower level of output in neurology. The number who pass both specialties together is negligible.
Because the supply of psychiatrists is so bound to the supply of physicians, we may well look fur- ther at the latter. Few subjects are so loaded with potential for polemics as the question of whether or not there are enough physicians in this country and whether or not their numbers are increasing or decreasing in comparison with the growth of our population. One of the favorite arguments for ad- vocates of either point of view is to engage in com- parisons between "then and now." The problem is how to choose the most equitable "then." For ex- ample, Turner (33) argues that there are increas- ing numbers of physicians being trained. He says, "While the population of the nation has approxi- mately doubled during this period [1900-1954], in
cians graduated from approved medical schools as compared to 6,861 in 1954, the latter figure repre- senting an increase of 114.8 per cent."3
The trouble, if there is trouble, with Turner's argument is to be found in the expression "ap- proved schools of medicine." In 1910 Flexner
(14) published a monumental report of an in- vestigation of medical schools. He classed 66 as Class A "Approved" schools and 65 as Class B and C "Unapproved" schools. The "Unapproved" schools had, that year, an enrollment of 8,996 students, which, if added to that in "Approved" schools, brings the total enrollment up to 21,526. This figure, if used as a basis for comparison, would mean an increase in enrollment of only 35.8 per cent instead of the 125.8 per cent (125.28 per cent) quoted above. The "Unapproved" schools graduated 1,275 physicians in 1910 making a total

prospects are that we will lose ground when the advantage of increased enrollments and the recent founding of new medical schools are offset by popu- lation increases.
For the future the medical schools are faced with the same low-tide manpower pool as are other areas of percentage increases? The argument runs as of education. Some medical schools have been hav-

ratio was 1.97to 1." They go on to point out that if the fall in applicants continues just a few more years there will not be enough people to fill medical school vacancies. Other medical educators, writing in the Journal oj Medical Education, warn that "the caliber of applicants to medical schools is falling" (15), and that some schools withgeo- graphic restrictions "had to 'scrape the bottom of the barrel'" (31). We conclude that for the next few years at least, the prospects are not favorable for a major increase in medical school enrollments.
These facts and trends in the supply of physi- cians and medical school enrollments indicate that there is little likelihood of the kind of increase that would be needed to result in a substantial rise in the number of psychiatrists. Increasing justmod- erately the number of medical school graduates would only slightly affect the number of newpsy- chiatric residents because, as a rule of thumb, the number of first-year residents in psychiatry each year is less than 10 per cent of medical school graduation figures.
There is, however, another source of psychiatric residents, and of residents in other specialties as well, which has appeared in recent years. Alien physicians, in increasing numbers, have been ac-
cepted as interns and residents in hospitals in this country. During the past five years the number of alien physicians in all residencies has increased from 8 per cent to 22 per cent. Most of these alien physicians have entered the U. S. under provisions of the U. S. Information and Exchange Act of1948.
Some 20 per cent to 25 per cent of the physicians now in residencies in psychiatry are from abroad and will return home when their training iscom- pleted ( 7 ) . While they offer service during their stay here, they do not represent any permanent in- crease in psychiatric manpower and actually their numbers inflate artificially figures on psychiatric residents in training.
PSYCHOLOGISTS
It is more difficult to define a psychologist than a psychiatrist and meaningful data are harder to obtain for psychology. While many persons em- ployed as psychiatrists have not had as muchspe- cialized training in psychiatry as leaders in the field might prescribe, at least a specified minimum of training is required in that all psychiatrists are physicians and have had the extensive clinical con- tact with patients that medical training involves. Psychology, on the other hand, is a broader and • more loosely denned field in which are employed people with various amounts of formal training. In this respect psychology is more like such spe- cialties as chemistry or engineering than it is like psychiatry.
A second difficulty, for our present purposes, in- volves deciding what proportion of psychologists may be considered to be in the field of mental health. Should we include only clinical psycholo- gists? Certainly people working in vocational guidance, in school psychology, and even some of those concerned with such areas as morale and motivation of military personnel, to cite but a few examples, may be thought of as contributing to mental health. There is no question but that a sizable number of psychologists would argue that they have no direct, and scarcely any indirect, con- cern with mental health. The scientist studying color vision, or the rodentologist with his T-maze, is not likely to welcome classificatory bedfellowship with the professional tester or counselor.
In some of the data we will present below we will use figures based on membership in the Ameri- can Psychological Association. Our rationalization
 is as follows: over half of the membership of APA is in clinical psychology or closely related areas (30). The total membership of APA is estimated to number about one-half of those employed in this country as psychologists (39). The reader should keep in mind that a sizable proportion of APA members have little or nothing to do with mental health, but that a sizable number of psychologists who are employed in the mental health field are not APA members. The exactness of the balance of these two groups is almost impossible to assess.
What sort of demands for services of psycholo- gists exists in the field of mental health? Once again one has a choice of estimates (2, 3, 11, 12, 20, 28). It is probably safe to say that existing needs could absorb easily an additional ten thou- sand trained people.
Most studies emphasize the need for people at the doctorate level. The Committee on Specialized Personnel of the Office of Defense Mobilization
(28) estimates that PhD's with research experi- ence are in shortest supply, particularly in physio- logical and experimental psychology. On the other hand, the Veterans Administration, projecting its needs for the next decade, indicates a continuing serious shortage of PhD-level clinical psychologists (see Figure 8). Felix (12) says that the southern region (sixteen states) needs seven times as many
'47 '48 49 '50 '51 '5Z '53 '54 '55 '56 YEAR

clinical psychologists as are now employed, and that eleven western states need a total of 2,000 clinical psychologists.
There is a pervasive belief among psychologists that psychology is one of the fastest-growing fields of specialization. Sanford (29) noted in 1951 that the membership of APA increased nearly twenty- fold in a quarter century. He quotes the extrapo- lation of psychology's growth curve by Boring in which the latter predicts 59 million psychologists a century hence. Carrying the extrapolation fur- ther, Sanford notes that the number of psycholo- gists will catch up with the world's population in less than 150 years! Fortunately, perhaps, there are signs that we are slowing down. Wolfle (39) has shown that the notion of very rapid growth in psychology is only partially true.
For each year of the past five years the number of new Associates of APA has remained fairly con- stant at about 1,300. Figure 9 illustrates the growth of the APA and, for contrast, the growth of the American Psychiatric Association. If, how- ever, we look at the number of PhD's in psychol- ogy and the number of first-year residents in psy- chiatry we see no startling gain for either group
(Figure 10).
Will our universities be able to turn out enough
people to fill the present and projected need for psychologists? The best predictions are that for the next few years we will not step up the number

ogy can expand training programs somewhat more readily as more qualified college graduates are at- tracted to the field. The more serious limitation on numbers of psychologists trained is the supply of college graduates forming the pool of potential graduate students, especially the number of p s y - chology majors. Figure 11 contrasts the numbers of bachelor's, master's, and doctor's degrees c o n - ferred in psychology since 1947-48. It will be noted that while there has been a steady increase in the number of doctorates conferred in psychol- ogy, the number of bachelor's degrees has declined along with the decline in college graduates in gen- eral. It seems certain that the next several years will see a drop, or at least a leveling off, in num- bers of doctorates as graduate school enrollments fall off with the shortage of college graduates we have noted.
A further problem that promises to affect p s y - chology somewhat more than the other mental health fields is the oncoming tide of college s t u - dents described above. The psychologist tradi- tionally has been a teacher, and as psychology is one of the most popular undergraduate subjects there will be an increased demand for college teachers of psychology. This increased demand will follow a decade or so of fairly low-levelpro- duction of doctorates in psychology.
What can the field of psychology do in the face of these prospects of shortages and static output? Is there any way to increase the number of trained psychologists? One thing which comes to mind at once is the value of taking steps now to get infor- mation about scientific and professional opportuni- ties in psychology to students who have not yet chosen their career, and to students majoring in psychology who are not well acquainted with the possibilities of further training. The recent Public Affairs Pamphlet on psychology ( 2 6 ) is one small step in the right direction. Despite the low tide of college students now enrolled, psychology should be able to attract a somewhat larger proportionof able students. Psychology, it should be noted, is the only one of the mental health professions that
has real continuing access to the attention of large numbers of college students before they have made firm decisions on their careers.
More psychology undergraduates might go on to graduate school if large university departments im- proved their contact with these students. Wolfle

of doctorates (39). In fact there will probably be some decline for a time.
University training centers for psychologists en- joy a certain advantage over psychiatric training centers from the point of view of flexibility in ex- panding training programs. While psychiatry must depend on the supply of physicians for its recruits, and also must depend on specialists who are in short supply for its training supervisors, psychol-

(39) notes that only 12 per cent of students who
 major in psychology have become professional psy- chologists. But as psychology bachelors comprise a representative cross-section of ability of all those receiving bachelor's degrees, many more than 12 per cent have the intellectual ability to succeed in graduate school (39).
Whatever we do to increase graduate enrollments during the next decade the shortage of psycholo- gists is likely to continue. Some ten to twenty years hence we should be able to increase sizably our output of doctorates. But as we have noted, demands increase as our population increases. There seems little chance that we will have enough psychologists even then.
SOCIAL WORKERS
It was harder to define who is a psychologist than who is a psychiatrist. It is harder still to de- fine who is a social worker.
According to Kendall (21), 'It has been esti- mated that there are approximately 75,000 persons employed in social work positions in the United States, of whom 16 per cent have completed two or more years of graduate study, 11 per cent have had one, but less than two years, 13 per cent have had less than one year, and 60 per cent have had no social work education."
We will be guided in our considerations of num- bers of social workers, and trends in their number, by statements of leaders of the profession itself as to who are social workers. Youngdahl (41) says, "At present the established norm for professional training consists of two years of graduate profes- sional training in an accredited school of social work." This definition agrees with the one used by the Health Resources Advisory Committee (20).
What is the present need for social workers in the mental health field? Let us turn once more to our sources and select some typical estimates. Blain (3) sees a need for 9,000 psychiatric social workers and figures it will take 20 years to find this number. The present shortage in state-sup- ported mental hospitals alone is approximately 7,000 (2) which represents a 75 per cent under- staffing (24). Gorman (17) counts only 800 psy- chiatric social workers in state institutions, which represents an even greater understaffing. At this rate, each social worker has, on the average, re-
sponsibility for six hundred patients. In 1952 there were 2,500 budgeted job vacancies for medi- cal and psychiatric social workers in this country
and a projected need for 4,200 more within five years (20). In these two specialties alone it is estimated that there is a deficit of at least 1,000 each year even if every graduate goes to work (20). Comparable shortages exist in all other fields of social work (12, 16, 21). The Council on Social Work Education (5) estimates that 50,000 new so- cial workers will be needed in the next decade, be- yond those who may leave the field.
How many social workers are being trained? Figure 12 illustrates the ten-year trend in num- bers of full-time students and graduates from two- year programs as compiled by the Council on So- cial Work Education. Once again we observe the postwar rise, but the decline has come earlier in social work than in the other two fields we have studied. From what we have said about the pool of potential professional school students, it will be apparent that the rise in numbers of social work students will be slow. Different specialties within social work show different trends. There has been a decrease in field placements in medical social work and in group work over the past four years and a slight increase in field placements in psychi- atric social work during this same time. All other fields of social work have about held their own (6).

 68 THE AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGIST
A survey in 1952 of 24 schools of social work with approved medical social work curricula showed that the number of students enrolled in this spe- cialty fell short of capacity by 42 per cent, while other schools without specialized curricula but with medical social work field placements were 58 per cent below capacity. It is estimated that these discrepancies between enrollment and vacancies still exist (20) and it is our impression that similar vacancies exist in other social work specialties. Kendall (21) notes that "many of the graduate schools are operating at less than full capacity."
Many reasons have been suggested for the diffi- culties in recruiting social work students and for the growing shortages in the field. One fact is that a high proportion of members of the profession are women (20) who leave the field. Other factors have been suggested by Eaton (9) and include low pay, prestige conflicts, and multiple identifications.
Leaders in social work are trying to step up re- cruitment activities. Among the more frequent ef- forts are programs of on-the-job training for col- lege students during the summer, workshops for college teachers in sociology and anthropology, visits by social work faculty to career conferences on college campuses, and work-study programs for those who cannot afford to spend two years in full- time graduate school study. It should be noted that this last effort, work-study programs, does little to increase the number of social workers, as a majority taking part in these programs are al- ready in the field.
Nothing in view leads to optimistic predictions concerning the problem of finding students for so- cial work in the numbers that are needed. Leaders in the field are making all sorts of active and imaginative efforts, however, and the other profes- sions can learn much from social work in this re- spect.
DISCUSSION
Let us review briefly the important points bear- ing on manpower trends and prospects in the three disciplines we have discussed.
We believe that there is wholehearted unanimity among knowledgeable people about the staggering dimensions of the mental health needs of the na- tion. From whatever viewpoint, be it humani- tarian, economic, or scientific, mental disorder is far and away our number one health problem. It
is real, it is now, and it will not go away. It will only get worse.
Everyone who is aware of the problem agrees that the need for trained professional personnel in the mental health field is desperate. The stark re- ality is that we cannot even keep up present num- bers in proportion to the population. We have not found a single optimistic voice. Occasionally some- one suggests a crash program with recruiting drives, publicity, subsidized training, and special induce- ments to lure more students into training programs. If the mental health professions were the only ones where personnel shortages existed, such pro- grams might be effective in increasing our output of trained people a few years hence. But shortages are not specific to our own fields. They are part of a more pervading shortage of scientific and professional personnel in general. Our pessimistic facts are duplicated in the shortages of teachers, nurses, engineers, and scientists.
But there must be other solutions to the mental health problem. Typhoid fever was not controlled by treating the disease. What about mental health research leading to prevention, or faster cures? As Hastings (19) puts it: "Without more basic knowl- edge than we have today or are now accumulating, the people who follow us fifty years hence will be struggling with the same problems that we are. The almost limitless future for the psychological sciences in the years ahead lies along the avenue of well-planned research activity done by many disciplines."
Psychologists probably receive more formal re- search training than do members of the other two fields. But it is our general impression, and this would be readily testable, that there is an inverse relation between the amount of time psychologists spend on basic research and their proximity to the field of mental health. The clinical psychologist all too often is loaded with service responsibilities, and his research, when he finds time for it, is likely to be concerned with evaluating or improving his skills and techniques rather than being a more basic attack on etiology or pathology. The social worker, too, is trained for service, and despite the growing emphasis on a research orientation in the social work curriculum, a scanning of the social work journals fails to turn up any really basic re- search. We have already noted the shortage of research-oriented psychiatrists.
In recent months there has been a wave of en-
 thusiasm for the tranquilizing drugs as an aid to speedier and more effective therapy. These early reports would seem to be encouraging indications that research can be productive even at the present rate of expenditure. Let us hope fervently that the reports are all based on careful study, though experience warns us to be cautious about such en- thusiasms. The memory of "focal infections" and "rest cures" and even electroconvulsive therapy bids us be careful. Worse still, if the new drugs fulfill even a portion of their promise we will be worse off than before, for most everyone agrees that the drugs are effective only in combination with psychotherapy. So hospitalized patients who formerly did not see a psychiatrist for long periods are now lining up outside his door.
Much is already known about mental disorder. Whether we agree about causes, at least we can agree that there probably are prophylactic and pre- ventive measures which can be effective if used early enough. One of the important aspects of pre- vention is work with children, or with parents in order to reach children. Again, while there are notable exceptions, and in this area perhaps a few exceptional people can be most influential, we find the usual shortages and lack of interest. Blain
(3) despairs at the trickle of child psychiatrists being turned out—some forty a year—and shows that at this rate of production it will take fifteen years to provide one child psychiatrist each for the 600 clinics needed today, not to mention the de- mands of children's residential homes, juvenile courts, school systems, etc. Similar shortages exist for child workers in the other mental health professions.
What is left? One fairly radical proposal has been made by Hastings (19) (though he credits the idea to Kubie and others). He suggests the creation of a new professional group, trained as psychotherapists, though not required to master all of the knowledge presently in the various profes- sional curricula. These people, who could be trained much more rapidly than can a psychiatrist or a psychologist, would not take over completely the field of therapy but would augment present per- sonnel and perhaps free more highly trained people for research. The obstacles to the implementation of this suggestion are enormous, as Hastings recog- nizes. Another profession on the scene might even increase present shortages in the established pro- fessions, and resistance from many quarters to such
infringement on sovereignty would be strong. But the suggestion is an intriguing one, and what we need (besides personnel, money, facilities, and skill) are ideas which can be implemented.
We can only conclude this survey with the pre- diction that our country will continue to be faced with personnel shortages in psychiatry, psychology, and social work for years to come. Barring the possibility of a massive national effort in all areas of education, or the possibility of a sharp break- through in mental health research, the prospects are pessimistic for improvements in the quantity or quality of service in the field of mental health.

### Your Biography

You are Evelyn Hooker, legend in the field of the psychology of human sexuality. In 1991, The APA  publicly recognizing you with an award for Distinguished Contribution in the Public Interest from the American Psychological Association. Your acceptance speech detailed your most famous study, and how it came to be. This is a rare case for a 'Reacting' character, so please excuse us as we quote it in length. It is far more detailed that we would ever be able to piece together from other sources.

When you received the APA’s award for Distinguished Contribution in the Public Interest in August 1992, you made a speech, which covered this part of the history of the APA.  A long excerpt from that speech is included here for your character development.  Do not quote or even paraphrase this speech in the course of the game - this is here are a primary source for you to understand your character’s biography and experiences during this period.


&gt; In 1953, when I applied for a six-month grant from the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) to study nonpatient, nonprisoner homosexuals, I had no intention of starting a new career. What I did not fully anticipate was the wealth of research demands and opportunities, the lively interest and cooperation of the gay community, and the continued interest and offers of assistance from the Grants Division of NIMH.

&gt; After I applied for the NIMH grant, the late John Eberhart came to UCLA to spend a day with me. It was clear that he wanted to see what and who I was. It was the height of the McCarthy era: Communists and homosexuals were the objects of destructive witch hunts. At the end of the day, Dr. Eberhard said "We are prepared to make you the grant, but you may not receive it. Everyone is being investigated. If you don't receive it, you won't know why and we won't know why."

&gt; I can only assume that either I was not investigated or that it was a slipshod investigation. In either case, why? My husband was a very distinguished professor of English at UCLA. In every way, he presented the characteristics of traditional values, but he fought very hard against the University of California loyalty oath, as had I. If the FBI had dug more deeply into my history, they would have found a first husband who drove an ambulance in the Spanish Civil War. If the question came to the FBI's attention at all, how did they interpret my interest in gay men? I will never know. If it was investigated, I did not know it.

&gt; Under the direction of Philip Sapir (who became chief of extramural grants when Dr. Eberhard left NIMH), I received a series of specific research grants until 1961, when I received a Research Career Award. During this time, Philip Sapir took a personal interest in my research, making the resources of his position available in incredible ways. For example, he invited me to give a lecture at NIMH especially for the research scientists, and afterward to spend three days in a seminar with a handpicked group of them. Because I worked alone, his moral, financial, and intellectual assistance became of the utmost importance. When I expressed my gratitude, he said that, in his position, he had general knowledge of many research projects and that it was very gratifying to know one in detail. It is highly probable that, without his interest and help, I would have stopped after the first major paper, and would not be here today.

&gt; **The Role of Serendipity** 	  	

&gt; As I reflect on the adverse conditions potentially threatening the successful pursuit of the goals of my research, I am impressed by the many serendipitous conditions that made the research possible. For example, a site visitor stressed the "fact" that members of the study committee would consider that I was working with psychopathology and that I must have a psychiatric consultant. With many reservations, I went to see the chair of the Psychiatry Department. When he asked about the research, I told him I was studying "normal male homosexuals." He rose from his chair and said, "What do you think you are doing? There is no such person." He then referred me to Frederic Worden, who had just come to the department. I let Dr. Worden read my application. He, then, turned to me and said, "I have never seen such persons, but I sure would like to." He became a valuable consultant.

&gt; A second perennially recurring situation was the demand of university officials that the research be conducted at the university. I resisted this demand because to have yielded would have meant the end. Not a single person would have come. The first absolute condition was secrecy and confidentiality. By great good fortune, our home was a very spacious estate of an acre of ground with a garden study separate from the house. It was there that the research was conducted. Once a person opened the garden gate, he was invisible to the neighbors. Without this superb place in which to conduct the research, I would never have attempted it.

&gt; **The Imperative of Confidentiality**

&gt; It will be obvious to you that the absolute sine qua non of research into behavior thought to be "a sin, a crime, and a disease" is confidentiality. Before I began the research, my friend Christopher Isherwood lived in the study for a while. If I asked him for a favor, he would often reply, "Yes, if you will keep me out of Norwalk." Norwalk is a California mental institution. The triple stigma was never far from the minds of the men whom I came to know nor was it far from mine.

&gt; The ramifications of confidentiality in this project were very extensive. A young gay man recently asked, "How did they know they could trust you?" The answer is, I don't know. Every testing and life history session was tape recorded. I assured each person that only my secretary would listen to them and after transcribing them would erase the tapes. Did they believe me? Yes, apparently so. One man who was nationally known by his books called me long distance at frequent intervals to ask whether his tapes had been erased.

&gt; One of my objectives was to understand each life as fully as possible, and thus to keep all of the personally identifying data for each man. This meant, in my view, that it would be impossible to share this highly confidential material with a co-worker. Building confidentiality with the gay community at that time was not an easy task. I could not lightly, if at all, share these confidences with another. Informal applications to be a coinvestigator were numerous, but I continued to work alone until the data gathering phase was complete.

&gt; Working alone in such a stress- and trauma-laden field inevitably entails high psychological costs. Without a colleague with whom to share the sympathetic knowledge of human suffering, sometimes one's own vicarious suffering becomes almost unbearable. This was especially true for me after my husband's death. I hasten to make clear that, when I characterize conducting research with gay men as stressful, I am only referring to the McCarthy era when the penalties were barbaric.

&gt; Even then, had I chosen just to remain in my study and let the gay men come to me, perhaps the stress would have been less. I could not settle for less. Instead, I accepted invitations to gay parties, gay organizations, gay after-hours clubs, and gay bars. I was convinced that, because of the secrecy imposed on gay men whose occupations and very lives were at risk if their identity became known, it was essential to know and understand everything I could about the gay social milieu that they created.

&gt; How it came to be known as the "gay world" remains a mystery to me. As I know it, however, the term in its generic meaning is, in part, justified. Camping, for example, is a dramatic form of behavior in both its high and low comic and tragic aspects. Perhaps an illustration will convey something of both. One evening at a dinner party attended by a number of distinguished writers and myself as the only woman, attention turned to how the guests could enhance my knowledge of gay institutions, for example, gay baths. My friend, Christopher Isherwood, then began a very dramatic story about how he would take me to the Crystal Baths on the Santa Monica beach, and what we would see, beginning on Level 1 – nude men in various sexual activities – complete with hilarious descriptions of the activities on each of the various levels until we reached the top. And then, he said, I would be killed, because no woman is allowed to know the secrets of the gay world and live.

&gt; The issue of confidentiality became acute in what I shall refer to later as "the Year of the Trial." Meanwhile, my adversarial position vis-a-vis the Los Angeles police force needs some clarification. I was pressured by a psychiatrist friend to seek an appointment with the chief of police. My friend said, "Of course he knows about your research activities and it would be helpful if he met you in person." How would the chief of police know about my research activities? In an invited paper entitled "The Gay Community," given in Copenhagen in 1961, I have described my research activities in gay bars. The police would have been aware of these activities, in part because I was usually the only woman in a bar. I hasten to add that I always went to a gay bar with a gay friend.

&gt; I was advised by my psychiatrist friend not to go alone for the appointment with the chief. Why? Because I was a woman. Dr. Worden accompanied me, biting his nails and saying that he had watched too many police films. Chief Parker did not understand why I was doing the research, "because a man from Pasadena proved it was all glandular." When I objected, he said "Well, it's like the smog. It doesn't matter how it got here. We just have to deal with it." He then wanted to introduce me to the Central Vice detail. I avoided that because I knew that if I did, the news would be all over the gay community within hours. I asked whether the police would ever try to subpoena my confidential files. "No," he replied, "If you should ever have information about a homosexual murder, I hope you would voluntarily give us the information."

&gt; I turn now to the Year of the Trial, 1961. Briefly, the facts are that five people were arrested and charged with conspiracy to obtain a criminal abortion. The five were two psychiatrists, an obstetrician, a young man, and myself. I had referred the young man (a friend) and his girlfriend to one psychiatrist, who had recommended a therapeutic abortion and who had sent the pair to a second psychiatrist, who made the same recommendation and sent them to an obstetrician. He performed the surgery in his office without a nurse present and sent the woman home. Complications developed. Her boyfriend insisted on hospitalization. Her father moved her to another hospital and declared charges to the police.

&gt; When two men, identifying themselves as with the state board of quality assurance visited me in my university office, I became alarmed when they asked "On what do you do research?" and "Do you accept fees for referrals?" It did not occur to me that I was personally in danger. However, waves of anxiety swept over me as I thought about the perils to my research data riddled with identifying names, places, and dates. I knew, as did many, of the unscrupulous surveillance practices of the Los Angeles Police Department at that time. My secretary and I spent the better part of the year in removing identifying data from the records. A judge, six months after the grand jury indictment, ruled that the jury had insufficient grounds to indict me. The anxiety did not diminish until both psychiatrists and the young man were declared innocent. Many of my friends believe that the police acted in my case only because of my research on homosexuality. It cannot be proved, but I believe it is so.

&gt; Incidentally, I carried a letter signed by the Chancellor at UCLA which identified me in case my activities were ever brought to the attention of law enforcement authorities. I never needed it, and felt I never would unless the university was involved.

&gt; **The NIMH Task Force** 	  	

&gt; In 1969, I was called by Stanley Yolles, then director of NIMH, asking me to come to Washington and "tell him what we ought to be doing about homosexuality." He added that "we want to sweep it out from beneath the rug." I suggested that we needed a group of thoughtful people who were social scientists or were in law, religion, or psychiatry and who could bring their knowledge to bear on this question. The director replied that if I would give him a list, he would make the appointments for a "blue ribbon task force." I looked forward to it with high expectations.

&gt; The agenda that I proposed was both a comprehensive outline of research and of social policy issues, including the possible endorsement of a model penal code and the establishment at NIMH of a center for the study of sexuality. Many members of the task force said at the outset that they knew nothing about homosexuality. I thought that should not exclude them because they were needed to bring social science to bear on the issues. The discussions were lively and gave promise of a good final report, with two exceptions.

&gt; The stumbling blocks were viewing homosexuality as not necessarily synonymous with psychopathology, and endorsing a model penal code in which homosexuality was no longer viewed as a crime. Thus, three task force members wrote dissenting opinions on the basis that (a) NIMH was not a policymaking, but solely a research institution, and (b) that there were not enough data to support the "normal" position. Within three years, however, the American Psychiatric Association voted to delete homosexuality from its diagnostic handbook, and the American Psychological Association (APA) followed.

&gt; Our task force report was not published for two years, an indication of what some officials thought of it. Judd Marmor, a distinguished and indispensable member of the task force, when asked why we did not accomplish more, said that one possible reason might be that I was too optimistic. That may be true. After all, in 1963, Dr. Marmor asked me to write a chapter for his first book on homosexuality, titled Inversion. He said that I must write it, "because you are the only person to hold your point of view."

&gt; **Highlights and Satisfactions** 	  	

&gt; I have spoken of some of the problems related to my research in the repressive milieu of the 1950s and I 960s. I would like now to mention some highlights of my satisfaction and delight.

&gt; First, can you imagine what it was like when I examined the results of the three judges of the adjustment ratings from the projective techniques? I knew the men for whom the ratings were made, and I was certain as a clinician that they were relatively free of psychopathology. But what would these superb clinicians find? You know now that the two groups, homosexuals and heterosexuals, did not differ in adjustment of psychopathology. When I saw that, I wept with joy. I knew that the psychiatrists would not accept it then. But sometime!

&gt; [cut, for the purposes of the game]

&gt; Another, earlier event was back in 1961, when I was invited to give a paper at the International Congress of Psychology. I learned that a young Norwegian, Finn Carling, was beginning a study of homosexuals and that it would be worth my while to see him. When I called him, he said that he was just beginning and that it would not be worth my while. I persisted, and he agreed to meet me at the airport. "You will know me because I have a big dog," he said. And so he did. Friends told me he was a spastic. Don't ask me how he drove his car, because he had the use of two forefingers only. He said, "If you don't mind not talking about science for awhile, I will show you where I grew up." He pointed to a stream running through a meadow where his parents had put him, having been told he would never walk. But he did – at 15.

&gt; After we had tea, he turned to me and said, "I want you to know that I am on their side." I think I said, "Me too." And then he said an astonishing thing: "I am not only studying homosexuals, but I am studying refugees, because they teach me the meaning of movement. I am studying the blind, because they will teach me the meaning of sight, of vision. I am studying homosexuals, because they will teach me the meaning of love.

&gt; That was 30 years ago, but Finn Carling's radiant face, his enormous physical and psychological courage, and what he wanted to learn from gay and lesbian folk have never faded in intensity. In an age when the scourge of AIDS continues relentlessly, there are many images of love in the gay world. I have the conviction that without love, the gay world would perish.

&gt; In the summer of 1937, at the height of the Spanish Civil War, I was in London. I attended a Spanish Republican rally. It was at fever pitch, so to speak, and the crowd was demanding that Paul Robeson, that great man and great voice, sing the Spanish National Anthem. From time to time, he would say "I'm saving the best to the last." Finally, with sounds that seemed to come from the bowels of the earth, he sang the Spanish National Anthem.

&gt;  I have one more event to note, and I have saved the most extraordinary to the Last. About four years ago, I received a letter from a trustee officer at a bank in Lincoln, Nebraska. In it he stated that Wayne Placek had designated me to select a committee to decide how the trust fund he was establishing should distribute funds for the purpose of research to increase "the general public's understanding of gay men and lesbians, and reduce the stress experienced by those people in this and future civilizations." I remember that I had interviewed Wayne Placek in the late 1950s, but nothing unusual came to mind. I did remember that, along with many others, he hated being gay because of society's treatment.

&gt; After a period of three years, the final settlement of the fund was announced – approximately a half million dollars! Through the valiant and imaginative work of Steve Morin and Douglas Kimmel, the money now is in the American Psychological Foundation, earmarked for research under the control of Dr. Morin and selected officers of Division 44, and the guidance of the Foundation.

### Game Objectives

You were trained as a behaviorist, by Karl Muenzinger and Robert Yerkes, who was a good friend of John Watson. Many of Watson's arguments draw from comparative psychology as a discipline. Muensinger's view, however, was more like Tolman's than Yerkes (see the &lt;!--\fullref{historyofpsychology}--&gt; in the gamebook). You are committed—as is your field—to the thesis that one can learn about the psychology of humans by studying the minds of animals. If the cognitivists are successful at getting the line between “man and brutes” reestablished, it may relegate your field to a psychological footnote.  Defend behaviorism, in particular the thesis that there is no hard and fast line between humans and animals, from the attacks of the cognitivitsts.



You published a pivotal study on homosexuality in 1956 and 1957 that along with Kinsey's report, is usually credited with starting the movement to remove homosexuality from the DSM.  Look up the study and read it carefully. You'll be expected to speak about its findings during the 1971 conference.  You should also understand your opponent's position on this matter.

Freud mentions homosexuality a number of places in Introductory Lectures on Psychoanalysis, and it is crucially important that you study these carefully.  Freud believes that sexual life of children, which is regarded at the time as 'normal' includes a number of activities that would later in life be viewed as 'perverse', including same-sex contact.  In Freud's theory, heterosexuality develops with puberty in normal people. In 'inverts' or homosexuals, something goes wrong in this development. The object of ones' 'natural' desire--the genitals of the opposite sex—becomes transformed into parts of the body that represent those parts in the same sex.  Thus, homosexuality is no different in psychological mechanism than a foot fetish or any other neurotic 'perversion' (see p. 376-384 of Introductory Lectures) Homosexuality is not a psychologically isolated condition. According to Freud:

&gt; “We are compelled, however, to regard the choice of an object of one's own sex as a divergence in erotic life which is of positively habitual occurrence, and we are learning more and more to ascribe an especially high importance to it.” (p. 381)

In short, homosexuality is a kind of neurosis, yet it is not, itself, particularly worrying. The action itself is merely 'habitual,' and hence can be cured through standard habit-blocking therapy (Freud suggests that paranoia stops homosexuality on p. 381 of the Introductory Lectures).  It is, however, invariably an indicator of deeper psychological problems, as the transference and substitution of the 'natural' object of sexual desire to a different object will cause neurosis. See Ch 26 of the Introductory Lectures, especially p. 530, for Freud's explanation of homosexuality as neurotic narcissism.

Your study, which sought to establish if homosexuals exhibited neurotic symptoms aside from their homosexuality, is a direct challenge to Freud's theory.  The current advocates of the Freudian tradition in Homosexuality are C. Socarides and I. Bieber.  Bieber's 1962 book Homosexuality presented the result of his 9-year study of 100 homosexual males. According to him, homosexuals males are those whose 'heterosexual instinct' is crippled in some way. Be ready to defend your study against criticisms from Socarides and Bieber.

**When, and if, the game reaches a point of trying to define mental illness**, you must pass a behaviorist interpretation of mental disorder / illness.

#### Specific Assignments

You are an initial member of the program committee, with your term expiring in 1972. That means it is your responsibility to coordinate with the other two members (Gebhard and Anastasi) to arrange the conference schedule for the second week of class. After that, consider running for the Board of Directors or President of the APA. 71: Washington DC, 72: Dallas.

In 1971, you are scheduled to give a talk entitled “The mental health of non-patient male homosexuals” during the panel session titled “ Psychiatry: Friend or Foe to Homosexuals: A Dialogue” with John Fryer. This talk should introduce the history of your research, and the data you have that shows that non-patient homosexuals are not mentally disordered. You might also make reference to the 1964 ‘Midtown Manhatten Study’ (1964), which seems to show that mental health disturbances are more related to social-economic status than any other factor—in this case, it may be consistent with your findings that any perceived mental illness is gay men is the result of their ostracism from society, rather than the cause thereof. 

In 1972, there will probably be competing papers from Socrides &amp; Bieber and Richard Green. Both of these papers will likely contain critiques or analyzes of your data. Be prepared to defend your study, or use it to critique others.

In 1973, oppose the dissolution of the nomenclature committee on grounds that the proposed taskforce would give too much power to a single individual: Spitzer.  The process of classifying mental illness needs to be open and transparent, and an elected committee would be more open and transparent than a taskforce.

iple 8. Client Relationship. The psy- t informs his prospective client of the im- aspects of the potential relationship that affect the client's decision to enter the rela-
Aspects of the relationship likely to affect the client's dccision include the recording of an interview, the use of interview material for training purposes, and observation of an interview by other persons.
When the client is not competent to evaluate tbe
situation (as in the case of a child)' the person ,, reponsible for the client is informed of the circum-
strnces rvhich may influence the relationship.
Xle psychologist does not normally enter into a pro- .fessional relationship with members of his own family, intimate friends, close associates, or others whose velfare might be jeopardized by such a dual relation- ,stip.
9. Impersonal Services. Psycholog- lcrvices for the purpose of diagnosis, treatment, lized advice are provided only in the
of a professional relationship and are not by means of public lectures or demonstra-
newspaper or magazine articles, radio or programs, mail, or similar media.
I]be preparation of personnel reports and recom- Irmdations based on test data secured solely by mail l,b unethical unless such appraisals are an integral part nl a continuing client relationship with a company, $ a result of which the consulting psychologist has c knowledge of the ctent's personnel situation lud can be assured thereby that his written appraisals .iill be adequate to the purpose and will be properly
ed by the client. These reports must not embellished with such detailed analyses of the sub- personality traits as would be appropriate only intensive interviews with the subject. The
nrust not make specific recommendations as tmplolment or placement of the subject which go the psychologist's knou'ledge of the job re-
quirements of the company. The reports must not purport to eliminate the company's need to carry on such other regular employment or personnel practices as appraisal of the work history, ctrecking of refer- ences, past performance in the company.
Principle 10. Announcement of Services. A psychologist adheres to professional rather than commercial standards in making known his avail- ability for professional services.
a. A psychologist does not directly solicit clients for individual diagnosis or therapy.
b. Individual listings in telephone directories are limited to name, highest relevant degree, certifrcation status, address, and telephone number. They may also in- clude identification in a few words of the psychologist's major areas of practice; for example, child tberapy, personnel selection, industrial psychology. Agency listings are equally modest.
c. Announcements of individual private practice are limited to a simple statement of the name, higbest relevant degree, certification or diplomate status, address, telephone number, offrce hours, and a brief explanation of the types of services rendered. An- nouncements of agencies may list names of stafr members with their qualifications. They conform in other particulars with the same standards as in-
dividual announcements, making certain that the true
nature of the organization is apparent.
d. A psychologist or agency announcing noncliuical pro-
fessional services may use brochures that are descrip- tive of services rendered but not evaluative. They may be sent to professional persons, schools, business firms, government agencies, and other similar organiza- tions.
e. The use in a brochure of "testimonials from satisfied users" is unacceptable. The offer of a free trial of services is unacceptable if it operates to misrepresent in any way the nature or the efficacy of the services rendered by the psychologist. Claims that a psy- chologist has unique skills or unique devices not available to others in the profession are made only if the special efficacy of these unique skills or devices has been demonstrated by scientifically acceptable
evidence.
f. The psychologist must not encourage (nor, within his
porver, even allow) a client to bave exaggerated ideas as to the efficacy of services rendered. Claims made to clients about the efficacy of his services must not go beyond those which the psychologist would be willing to subjcct to professional scrutiny through publishing his results and his claims in a professional journal.
Principle 11. Interprofessional Relations. A psychologist acts with integrity in regard to col- leagues in psychology and in other professions.
a. A psychologist does not normally offer professional services to a person rcceiving psychological assistance from anotber professional worker except by agxeement

Itililor's note. At the Board of Directors meeting held February 13-15, 1969, funds were authorized to conduct a Conference on Recruitment. Such a conference was held April 18-20, 1969, arranged for and chaired by George Albee. A report of this conference was prepared by Albcc and was presented to the Board of Directors at its meeting on May 1S-T7, 1969. After careful consideration of the
Report of the Conference, the report was "Received with lhanks by the Al'A Board of Directors and was referred to the APA governance for study and recommendation,noting that individuals in the field and in funding agencies should also play a role." Such action by the Board of Directors will insure continued attention by APA boards and com- mittees to those appropriate matters and issues discussed with representatives of the Association of Black Psycholo- gists and to the mallei's symbolized by the Statement of Concern.

Chairmen, and the Committee on Equality of Op- portunity in .Psychology, invited persons with special technical competence, and resource people from Federal agencies and from the staff of APA.
In the course of the discussions the Conference participants became increasingly aware of the ex- tent of underrepresentation of minority groups in psychology; they became impressed, too, with the urgency with which those in American psychology must act both to put our own house in order and to set an example to other organizations that may be expected to be encouraged to follow our lead. For example, we were impressed with the facts, well documented by the Committee on Equality of Opportunity in Psychology, that the 10 most prestigious departments of psychology in the United States granted only 8 PhDs in psychology to Negro candidates between 1920 and 1966 while granting a total of 3,767 PhDs during this period; six of these leading departments had not had a single Negro PhD. Of the largest producers of PhDs during this period fewer than 1 % of the doctorates were won by black students. (Tt is these same departments, we cannot resist noting, that supply the bulk of psychological consultation to Federal
training and research programs.)
The Conference participants are aware of the
fact that deeply held attitudes and behavior pat- terns cannot be legislated out of existence and that pious platitudes cannot change the world. But we also are aware that leaders who truly lead can often mobilize widespread readiness for positive action, and so we urge the APA Council, boards, and committees, and our whole organizational and staff structure, to provide leadership in expanding the opportunities for black and other minority group students and faculty to enter the mainstream of psychology.
The tenor of the discussion was serious and con- cerned, and seldom unreasonable. Participants generally agreed that large efforts had to be made at all levels—making opportunities available in

 graduate departments for qualified black and other minority group students, with special financial as- sistance earmarked; improving the quality of under- graduate education in psychology at predominant!}' black colleges; recruiting more able undergraduates to these departments; improving the educational opportunities in elementary and secondary schools for disadvantaged students; and working to elimi- nate the effects of racism throughout our society. At the same time it was recognized that there is an important substantive body of knowledge in psy- chology and that graduate work makes strenuous
demands. One of the black participants said it well: "There is a great need to avoid the encourage- ment, implicit or otherwise, of 'half-baked,' non- scientific black departments of psychology for the production of instant black psychologists whose only forte would be some vague 'community psy- chology'." This same man spoke of the urgency of "recruiting and holding capable faculty mem- bers, updating and in most instances creating adequate facilities for laboratory experiences, up- dating and increasing library resources, and offering financial support to students who frequently are indigent."
We were impressed with the findings of the Wispe Committee on Equal Opportunities that more than half of all Negro psychologists live in the South, and an even higher percentage were born there and received their bachelor's degrees there. We agree with this Committee that "More active steps should be taken . . . to recruit and train for careers in psychology graduates from Negro colleges, especially located in the South."
studying the problems of recruiting minority group students for careers in psychology, and is presently preparing a proposal that, after being approved by APA governance, will go to the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH). Tt is the belief of the Committee that existing programs such as the National Science Foundation Visiting Scientist Pro- gram, the Careers-in-Psychology program, etc., are not especially suitable for this purpose; their proposal will use integrated visiting teams carrying out a carefully planned program.
We note the encouraging fact that the prestigious Council of Graduate Department Chairmen has appointed a committee to concern itself with ways of encouraging the admission of more black and other minority group students into graduate study in psychology. We urge this organization to find creative ways quickly, and we concur with the recommendation of the Wispe Committee that "More elasticity in admission requirements for graduate training should be considered by the . . . Conference of Graduate Department Chairmen."
The matter of admission requirements, par- ticularly the predictive value of highly verbal tests, is a complex subject, but the Conference spent some time discussing these problems. While recognizing that verbal tests are unquestionably predictive of college and graduate school grades in a system that emphasizes verbal performance, the Conference also noted the relatively low predictive value of graduate school classroom performance for later scientific or professional success. It may
be that a broadening of the psychological cur-

fellowships, funded by Federal sources, for the con-

Negro colleges. We would encourage efforts by
such organizations as the Southern Regional Educa-

The Committee on Equal Opportunities has been as they begin to approximate scientific and profes-
on ultimate career patterns.
In this regard there was discussion of the ques-
tion of the relevance of much of the content of graduate education in psychology to critical human problems on which man's survival itself may de- pend—problems like war, overpopulation, racism, and the increasing pollution of our social and physical environment. APA cannot tell university departments what to teach, but we do know enough about reinforcement theory to suggest that both

sional concern with these problems. We note with approval that the theme of the 1969 Annual ATA Convention is "Psychology and Problems of So- ciety."
Each board and committee, each division of APA, and each state psychological association should examine its current activities and its com- mittee structure to see what steps it can take to deal with current problems of the black psycholog- ical community.
We encourage divisions and stale associations to devote more attention in their newsletters and at their annual programs to the creation of a climate that encourages the application of psychological research and knowledge to reduce racism and the problems it creates. We would hope, for example, that those divisions and state associations that sponsor postdoctoral institutes and workshops might devote time to the psychological aspects of racism.
We suggest that divisional and state psycholog- ical groups consider what they might do to acquaint qualified minority group students in high schools and colleges with career opportunities in psy- chology; we recommend also that some of the obvious energies of the state associations, so long expended in legislative and other professional matters, be directed toward finding creative ways of increasing the number of disadvantaged students in undergraduate and graduate programs in psy- chology and increasing the participation of black psychologists in psychological association programs.
Among the other recommendations coming out of the Conference are the following:
We would ask APA to recommend that NTMH add extra stipends to existing training grants, stipends specifically earmarked for higher risk minority group students who might be encouraged in some cases to spend a "bridge year" in courses selected as preparatory to graduate study.
We further urge that APA use its influence with NIMH, the Office of Education, and the Social Rehabilitation Service to seek new and effective ways to fund programs for minority group students, especially at the undergraduate level, with the goal of increasing the pool of potential graduate students for the human service professions. Such support might carry over to the early years of graduate school in the way Social Science Research Council support is now given.
In this context we would also ask that Federal granting agencies make a more effective effort at involving qualified black and other minority group psychologists and social scientists on their panels, study sections, and staffs. As noted elsewhere in this report the most prestigious universities, which supply a large proportion of government consult- ants and panel members, have not been distinguished as producers of black PhDs and so may not be expected to have special qualifications in this gen- eral area.
The Education and Training Board of APA has extensive contacts with nearly every graduate doc- toral program in the country. Questions asked by its site visitors receive careful attention and may promote desirable changes. While the Education and Training Board cannot and should not dictate admissions or patterns of graduate training it could seek out and encourage demonstration programs more consistent with the needs of minority group students and experimentation with curriculum changes.
As another example of what APA could do, the Committee on Subdoctoral Education in Psychology could develop recommendations for special pro- grams designed to remedy critical shortages in such fields as MA-level black counselors for community colleges or of Mexican-American and Puerto Rican school psychologists. The various curriculum pro- grams being developed can focus on problems of relevance and also on recruitment of minority group students. It is expected that representatives of the Association of Black Psychologists and other minority groups might make useful contributions to these developments.
The AP A Committee on Precollege Psychology and the Division 2 Committee on Psychology in the High Schools could pay special attention to the problems of largely black or Mexican-American or Puerto Rican high schools.
We cite these merely as examples of actions pos- sible at many levels of APA governance structure.
One of the recurring themes throughout the Conference was the urgent need for black role models in psychology—persons who might be ex- amples to black undergraduates of the opportunities available to them in psychology. Because of the relatively small number of black psychologists and especially black college teachers, and because the large and affluent largely white universities are
 hiring black faculty away from the predominantly black southern colleges, this is an increasingly serious need.
We recommend that APA develop a series of training films featuring black and other minority group psychologists for use in classrooms in both largely black and largely white institutions. APA's demonstrated competence in this area (e.g., "Focus on Behavior") and the potential attractiveness of such a project to NIMH suggest that this proposal be given high priority by the Board.
Numerous other examples will occur to members of various boards and committees to whom we hope the Board will direct proposals for action.
The Conference noted with concern the fact that a large number of black psychologists belong neither to APA nor to state or local psychological associations. While there may have been good reasons in the past why these psychologists felt that APA, and the other professional groups, had little to offer them, it is our hope that this situation no longer obtains. Other special groups in psy- chology have found that an organized effort, even by a relatively small number, can have dramatic effects on the APA governance structure, including changes in the distribution of budgeted activities; black and other minority group psychologists may note that this Conference, and many other cur- rent APA activities, have been triggered by the
"Statement of Concerns" of the Association of Black Psychologists presented to Council in Oc- tober 1968. We hope this lesson is not lost and that organizational activity within APA by black psychologists will increase.
The Conference asked that APA use its influence to assure itself of nondiscriminating practices among its service users and contractors—printers, ad- vertisers, employer listings, etc. A statement to this effect should be carried in contracts, promo- tional material, and publications.
We also recommend to the Editor that a new and regularly scheduled section of the American Psychologist be created, to report on "Psychology and Problems of Society," which might serve as a source of information to our members about signifi- cant developments in research, in Federal and state programming, and in the activity of our science as a means of promoting human welfare.
We further recommend that eventually a position be created in the Central Office under the general direction of the Executive Officer to be concerned with relating psychology to social problems includ- ing those dealt with in this report.
We urge that the Board of Directors of APA approve the spirit of these recommendations and refer them as appropriate for action to boards, committees, divisions, and state associations.

Homosexuality-Socandes 1199
￼a conservative estimate is that be tween 2,500,000 and 4,000,000 adult American males sufier from this con- dition. By way of comparison, a Public Health Service report esti- mates the four major illnesses in this country (1963 to 1965) as: heart disease, 3,619,000; arthritis and rheumatism, 3,481,00O; impairment (except paralysis) of the back and spine, 1,769,000; mental and nervous disease, 1,767,000.u
The female homosexual finds her- self in a paradoxical situation. Al- though suffering in essence with the same disorder as her male counter- part, little concern has been manifest by either the medical or legal pro- fessions about her condition. She too, however, needs special medical, legal, and sociological consideration.
Many writers prefer to use the term "lesbianism" to describe the clinical condition of female homo- sexuality. This reflects an attempt to romanticize and minimize it. Ho- mosexual relations between women are often considered superficial and some sources do not regard female homosexual contacts as sexual at all despite intense orgastic experiences between the women involved. Never- theless, their plight is as grave if not more so than that of the male homo- sexuals. For example, the loss of a homosexual partner can lead the bereft female homosexual to severe depressions and suicide with greater frequency than in the male.
I have dealt intensively with the illnesses diagnosed as perversions,'' '5 especially with homosexuality, fol the past 15 years-both in clinical practice and in teaching. Our first step is to ask ourselves "What is a homosexual?" fn essence, a homo- sexual is a person who consistently and from inner necessity engages in homosexual acts. This pattern arises from faulty sexual identity, a prod- uct of the earliest years of life. Typ- ically, we find a pathological family constellation in which there is a domineering, crushing mother who will not allow the developing child to
achieve autonomy from her and an absent, weak, or rejecting father.
There are two categories of home' sexuality: obligatory (true) homo- sexuality and episodic homosexual behavior. The latter is characterized by isolated homosexual acts without the stereotypy, the corhpulsivity, of the former and is due to the con- scious desire for variational experi- ence, the achievement of "sPecial gains," such as power and Prestige, or the quest for unusual sensations. Such transient behavior may occur in specific situations as well; it may be rampant in prisons, remote set- tlements, or during other tYPes of confinement where persons of the opposite sex are not available. Ex- cept for those already predisposed to homosexuality through early psy- chological trauma, the individual reverts to heterosexual behavior when members of the oPPosite sex are again available. Current research points to the fact that a person does not become a true obligatorY homo- sexual if the initial design is not laid out by 3 years of age, that is, during the preoedipal period of develoP- ment.
There is a high incidence of Para- noia or paranoid-like symptomato- logy in overt homosexuals. This is related to the medical fact that overt obligatory homosexuality is either a fixation or regression to the earliest stages of ego development. As a re- sult, archaic and primitive mental mechanisms belonging to the earliest stages of life characterize the homo- sexual's behavior. Also, homosexual- ity, obligatory or not, can be seen in the schizophrenic in his frantic at- tempt to establish some vestige of object relations as an expression of the fragmented and disorganized psychic apparatus with which he has to struggle.
It is misleading to classifY homo- sexuality as a sociopathic disorder. Not all homosexuals or perhaps even a majority display the "absence of conscience" mechanism so charac- teristic of the so-called psychopath.
The compulsivity of the sexual pression, its insistence for despite all dangers to the
and all risks, gives the
that one does not care about lished social institutions or oneself. The annals of political tory include personalities at very highest levels, men with exceptionally well-developed
of public and social good, who experienced the tragic
of their homosexual illness.

2. Homosexual obiect choice is .not innate or instinctual nor is hetcr- cexual object choice since botlr are learned behavior. The choice of sex- rul object is not predetermined by
chromosomal tagging. Heter&lt;lsexual object choice is determined from birth due to cultural and environ- mental indoctrination. It is support- .ed by universal human concepts of lnating and the family unit with the omplementariness and contrast be-
the two sexes- It is further determined bv zVz billion years of
evolution and is a producl of sexual differentiation, at first y based on reproduction but widened to include sexual ification, eg, from one-celled
al fission the development of two-celled sexual reproduction to
rate entire organ differentiation finally to the development of rate individuals reciprocally
to each other anatomically. nologically, psychologically,
in many other ways.
Only massive childhood fears can
ge and disrupt the standard female pattern. Such early un- ious feals are responsible for
later development of homosex- ty.
3. Homosexual behavior which is igatory ( episodic t is prac- by individuals through choice a variety of motivations and ld not be confused with true
xuality. These motivations as complex as any other moti- which may influence humnn ior: personal gain. power, Farch for a variational experience (an extra sexual "thrill" r, pr.eferred and position, etc. This form not caused by unconscious fears ensuing guilt but is due to con- deliberate choice. One must ull.y differentiate between the tory and the nonobligatoly as latter type would like to mask
behind true honrosexuality in order to save plidc and iustify its occur- rence.
4. Since thc obligator.v lromosex- ual is suflering fronr an illness it is obvious that hc should not be lren- alized fol tlre consequent activities carried out in private, not oflensive to public decency, and in Jlartner- ship with a consenting adult. He should not be made to suffer special penalties because of the manifesta- tion of his illness so long as it is not
ac&lt;omp:rnied b-y antisrrcial or crim- inal behavior.
The view that obligatory homo- sexuality per se is punishable by law and thc view that it is, in fact, a medical problern are antithetical and this matter requires revision. How- ever. any change in the legal code should be accompanied by a clear- cut statement as to the nature of obligatory homosexualit.y, its diag- nosis as a form of mental illness, and a universal declaration of support
for its treatment by qualified medical practitioners.
The Wolfenden report'' succeed- ed in having legislation passed in England redressing the inequities Iaced by the homosexual but it re- grettably failed both the homosexual and the public by not making it ex- plicit that homosexuality is an emo- tional illness and, therefore, lies within the province of medicine. One might have recommended this addition to the Wolfenden report:
Homosexurtlitv is a form of e'motional disorder q'hit'h mav cause such grave clisruptiori to the equililrrium of thc in- dividual that all meaningful rt'lation- .ships in life are damaged from the outsel anrl peculiarly susceptible to breakdou'n :lnd destruction. Furlher. attitudes tou':rrd the olrllosite s€x ar€ so fille&lt;l q'ith dislrust, abhorrence, hate. anrl revulsion as tcl render thcnr imp&lt;lssiblc of anv relationshilr except on the' mo.st superficial and briltle basis, if then. The.sc characteristi&lt;'s are an outcome of childhood fears u'hich r.ripl&gt;lr, the individual in his total ad:rptation.
All nrale homosexuals suffer, para- doxically, fronr the yearning to be a
mart, not a woman ils conlmonly as- sumeal. They ho1;c to :rchieve a "shot" of nrasculinity in the homo- sexual act. Ostensitrly they ma.\'l)e- have in an alTcctionitte and kindly way towtird the sexuirl parttter bttt this is a veneer, a rationillization, to cover the life-saving, ego-saving o1t- er{rtion of obligatory homosuxualitv. The homosexuill must carry out his act; unless he does he will sufler in- tolerable anxiety and experience massive threat to his psychic organ-
ization nnd functioning. Like the addict, he must have his "fix."
In the light of clinical research the honrosexual symptom can be seen as an intricately designed de- fense whose purpose is to maintain the equilibrium of a severely disturb- ed individual. Tampering with his psyche by unqualificd persons is to be condemned as he may become seriously disorganized if a prema- turc attempt is made to interrupt his homosexual activities. Conversely, an individual, however impelled to- ward them, who has refrained from homosexual activities may be tragi- cally pushed into them by unwise guidance.
5. There is no obligatory homo- sexual who can be considered to be health.y. The very existence of this condition precludes it. Despite the appearance at any given time of adequate life performance, there is always extreme conflict present which threatens to disrupt this frag- ile adiustment.
6. As oblig:rtory homosexuality carl not be considered to be a legal isstre, so it can not be viewed as a problem of morality. As with psy- chosis and neurosis, it can not be regarded as n consequence of im- molality ol a manifestation of evil spilits occupying the body for which special tortures were devised and special legal punishment was ex- acted.
These misconceptions must be corrected. It would, however, be the utmost folly to remed.Y then.r and then disrniss or overlook the deeP

￼psychological disturbance which is the basis of the homosexual condi- tion. Some well-intentioned groups would have us not only do away with legal and moral issues but have us announce that homosexuals are not ill at all. They point to disturbances among heterosexuals and attempt to make a comparison. While the ex- istence of psychosis and neurosis are, of course, found in heterosexual- ity, the heterosexual orientation is not, of itself, an indication of path- ological condition while homosex- uality always is. The inability to function heterosexually and the ex- treme hostility toward the opposite sex originating in the fear of one's impulses toward the mother has led to a wholesale flight from the female forever and to a compromise adapta- tion of choosing a male for sexual gratification and to save the self from intolerable anxiety.
We practice today in the atmos- phere of a sweeping sexual revolu- tion. Together with the mainstream heterosexual revolt has come the an- nouncement that a homosexual rev- olution is also in progress and that homosexuality should be granted total acceptance as a valid form of sexual functioning, different from but equal to heterosexuality. Such acceptance of homosexuality, as being a simple variation of normal- ity, is naive, not to say grounded in ignorance. Equally misleading is the idea that it is merely an asPect of normal development, a transient stage of adolescence, without mean- ingful sequallae. That we, as phy- sicians, could be persuaded to overlook such tcnden&lt;'ies among our young people is a harmful fantasy as shown by the fact that colleges can be pressured to charter homo- sexual groups on campus with all the privileges of other scholastic alrd social organizations, thereby lending tacit approval.
The implications of such trends are profound. I'or the adolescent, they make him uncertilin and con- fused. Even for an adult, struggling
to strengthen what may be a frail heterosexual- organization, the vi- cissitudes of maintaining sexual adequacy may drive him into a self- despising homosexual pattern. He does not know how else to resolve the deep conflicts which have per- sisted and tortured him since early childhood. Homosexuality is a fore- doomed attempt to find a panacea for the tormenting fear which origi- nated in early childhood and like any unrealistic solution remains un- satisfactory at all times and disas- trous much of the time.
It is vitally important to realize this fundamental point: the diag- nosis of homosexuality can not be self-made, imposed by jurists, ar- ticulated by clergy, or speculated about by social scientists. True ob- ligatory homosexuality is a complex condition and has to be difrerenti- ated from episodic homosexual be- havior entered into for a variety of conscious motivations as stated.
If the homosexual is to be granted his human right as a medical pa- tient, issues which becloud his status should be clarified. Above all, the homosexual must be recognized as an individual who presents a med- ical problem.
The whole issue of homosexuality must be transformed into one more scientific challenge to medicine which has time and again been :rble to alleviate the plaguing illnesses of man. With this respected leadership on the part of the physician, we will see a surge of support for the study and treatment of the disorder by all the techniques and knowledge nvail- able through the great resources and medical talent of the United States.

AN EXAMINATION OF WILHELM REICH’S DEMONSTRATIONS OF ORGONE ENERGY
Author:
Robert L. Spitzer, M.D. - Cornell University (April 1953)
Purpose
Wilhelm Reich’s early work in psychoanalysis gradually led him into a field which he now calls biophysics. The concept of a new kind of energy, which he calls “orgone energy,” is basic to his present work. Reich defines orgone energy as “Primordial cosmic energy; universally present and demonstrable visually, thermically, electroscopically, and by means of Geiger-Müller counters. In the living organism: biological energy. Discovered by Reich between 1936 and 1940.” [1]
In his many writings of the past decade, Reich has by means of the concept of orgone energy presented explanations of such varied phenomena as the origin of life, the origin of the galaxies, the aetiology of cancer and neuroses, the belief of people in God, and many other phenomena. To one who has carefully read Reich’s work, it becomes clear that if orgone energy does exist and has the properties ascribed to it by Reich, then clearly, an understanding of orgone energy is a most valuable piece of information, useful in explaining many riddles of nature.
The purpose of this paper is to present a critical examination of the demonstrations of orgone energy offered by Reich in his book, The Cancer Biopathy. [2] The examination offered in this paper consists of the duplication by the writer of eight crucial experiments offered by Reich as proof of the existence of orgone energy along with control experiments devised by the writer to better ascertain the validity of the conclusions that Reich draws from his data.
Selection of Experiments
It was not possible, nor necessary, to duplicate all of the experiments described by Reich. “Bion” experiments involving the use of an extremely high-powered microscope and experiments using a Geiger-Müller counter were not done, because it was impossible to secure the necessary instruments. A study of the therapeutic effect of the Orgone Accumulator upon the human organism could not be attempted, because to do justice to the problem, it would be necessary to have at least eight subjects devote a half an hour a day for a period of at least a month, and such subjects were not available. However, of the eight experiments duplicated, three in particular form the pillars upon which the verification of the concept of orgone energy rests: namely, the visual, thermal, and electroscopic demonstrations.

It is, of course, obvious but perhaps necessary to state that this paper deals only with that

part of Reich’s work which deals specifically with the concept of orgone energy. It is in no way meant as an evaluation of any other part of Reich’s work or of his psychological and psychoanalytical theories.
The work outlined in these pages was not done hastily but in all, took eight months to complete. It was all conducted from September 1952 to April 1953 at Ithaca, New York. All of the experiments are fairly simple and can easily be reproduced by anyone interested. The experiments were approached objectively and the conclusions drawn were dictated solely by the data collected.
I. Visual Demonstration of Orgone Energy
A. Flickering in the Sky
[3] Problem
According to Reich, orgone energy can be observed visibly in the sky by looking “as if in the far distance.” The energy is perceived as a wave-like, rhythmical flickering, with rapidly appearing and disappearing dots and lines of light. Because the phenomenon changes with various weather conditions and ceases if the eyes are closed, Reich concludes that the phenomenon is present throughout the atmosphere and visible “in the sky.”
The experiments performed here attempted to control the focal distance between the retina of the eye and the outside world to determine whether the phenomenon is in the sky or atmosphere of the earth or solely in the eye of the observer.
Procedure
Eight naive subjects were used. Each subject was placed in front of a window through which the sky could be viewed. Each was instructed to look as if in the far distance and report when he observed the flickering phenomenon. The subject was then seated in front of a ground-glass screen that was illuminated by an electric light bulb attached to a rheostat to vary the intensity of the light. With his eyes a fraction of an inch away from the illuminated screen with the bulb at its most intense illumination, the subject was asked to report what he saw. The intensity of the bulb was then varied, and the subject was asked to report any changes in what he saw.
Results
All eight subjects quickly perceived the flickering phenomenon in the sky described by Reich. All eight subjects, when seated in front of the bright, ground-glass screen reported that they saw the same phenomenon as in the sky only that it appeared more intense in front of the glass screen. All eight subjects reported that the phenomenon became less intense and finally disappeared as the intensity of the bulb was lowered.
Conclusions
If the phenomenon were in the sky, then the phenomenon should either disappear completely or be much less intense when the eyes are directly in front of a translucent screen. However, the results prove, with a confidence limit of 95%, that the phenomenon of flickering in the sky has nothing whatever to do with an energy in the sky but exists solely in the eye and becomes visible upon adequate illumination of the eye. Reich’s claim that the phenomenon is less intense on hazy days due to the absorption of orgone energy by the
     
humidity appears to be without foundation, as the critical factor seems to be the intensity of the field as shown by the fact that all of the subjects reported that the phenomenon disappeared when the light was turned down.
As to just what occurs in the eye which creates this phenomenon, whether it be blood corpuscles moving on the retina or the random discharge of rods or cones, is not of direct concern here but requires further study.
B. Perception of Orgone Energy in an Orgone Room
[4] Problem
Reich reports that in a light-tight, dark room, only black is perceived, while in an “orgone room” constructed by lining a regular room with sheet metal, the higher concentration of orgone energy is visible in the following manner: “In the course of about half an hour the complete darkness gives way to a vague blue-gray shimmer. It is as if vapors of gray blue color were slowly moving through the room.” [5] The first part of the experiment is devised to see whether the light phenomenon in an orgone room, as described by Reich, differs from that observed in a regular room. Reich maintains that the light phenomena were objective and were magnified with simple magnifying glasses. An attempt was made to determine whether the light phenomena were objective or existed solely in the eye of the observer. Reich reports that in an orgone room, the eyes become irritated, and hence an attempt was made to determine whether such irritation is reported in a regular dark room.
Procedure
Eight naïve subjects were used in two groups of four. Each group on two separate occasions sat in a light-tight, dark room and were instructed to write as best they could on a blank, white card everything that they saw and to make careful note of the possible form, color, and movement, if any, of what they saw. If they saw anything, they were to put their hands in front of their eyes and to report whether the phenomenon changed. They were instructed not to talk while in the darkroom about what they saw. As each group left the darkroom, the members were instructed to record whether their eyes felt irritated.
Results
All but one of the subjects wrote that they saw various colors other than black. Only one subject reported that all he saw was black, although he qualified it by describing it as “black of different intensities” to indicate a fog-like formation.
All of the subjects, except the one who saw only black, reported movement of various kinds. Some saw fog-like movement: dots, streaks, etc. The same seven subjects later reported that their eyes felt irritated.
All of the subjects reported that the phenomenon did not change in the least way when they put their hands in front of their eyes.
Conclusions
Reich’s claim that in a dark room “We see nothing but black, that is, nothing. . . . In an absolute darkroom there is absolute darkness” [6] appears to be completely erroneous. Immediately or upon adaptation of the eyes, the dark room does not appear black but
 
generally grayish, and various colors are perceived as demonstrated by this experiment, with a confidence limit of 95%. Hence, the light phenomenon which Reich describes as being peculiar to the orgone room appears to be no different from that observed in a regular dark room.
As the light phenomenon was not affected by the placing of the hands over the eyes, the phenomenon must be subjective and therefore cannot be magnified.
As seven of the subjects all reported that their eyes were irritated in an ordinary dark room; there is no grounds for believing that any energy peculiar to an orgone room is responsible.
Thus, the light phenomenon in an orgone room appears to be the same as that observed in a regular dark room and is a subjective phenomenon. The exact nature and cause of the phenomenon, like the cause of the flickering in the sky, is not of direct concern here but requires further study. The irritations reported by the subjects is most likely due to the straining effect of keeping one’s eyes open in the dark for a long period of time without focusing the eyes on any subject.
II. Electrostatic Demonstration of Orgone Energy
A. Electroscopic Demonstration of Two Basic Principles of Orgone Energy
[7]
Problem
Reich contends that what is known as “static electricity” is in reality orgone energy. He believes that orgone energy has two basic governing principles: 1) orgone energy and organic material attract each other, and 2) orgone energy and metal first attract each other and then immediately repel each other. As will be seen in the problem dealing with the thermal demonstration of orgone energy in an Orgone Accumulator, these principles are basic to the theory behind the construction of Reich’s Orgone Accumulator.
The purpose of this experiment was to duplicate Reich’s demonstration of the above two principles. He describes his experiment and the conclusions that he draws from them as follows:
A metal sphere is set on a rubber or cork plate. On one side of the equator of the sphere, at a distance of about 2–3 mm., we suspend a small piece of cork, on the other side, at the same distance, a small piece of tinfoil. The metal sphere is connected by a wire with an electroscope.
We then charge a polystyrene rod by stroking it once or twice, without rubbing, over our hair. The rod is then brought near the metal point of the electroscope which is connected with the sphere. . . . The cork will move toward the metal sphere and will adhere to it for a shorter or longer period of time. This means: the orgone energy in the rod has led to the formation of an orgone energy field around the metal sphere, in which organic material is attracted and held fast.
At the other side of the sphere we notice what happens with the tinfoil when we approach the charged rod to the electroscope. We observe that the effect on the tinfoil is different [emphasis mine—R.S.] from that on the cork. The
 
tinfoil is first attracted toward the metal sphere but immediately repelled and held at a distance. That is, two metallic substances in the orgone energy field repel each other. From this it follows also that metal attracts orgone but instead of absorbing it, as organic material does, it repels it. [8]
Procedure
The experimental design as described by Reich, as above, was duplicated, and data on various days was collected.
Results
Whenever the electroscope was charged, the cork and tinfoil were attracted toward the metal sphere. As soon as the cork and tinfoil touched the sphere, both the cork and tinfoil were immediately repelled and held at a distance. The cork and tinfoil then both gradually came closer to the metal shape and again, as soon as they touched the sphere, both were repelled and held at a distance. This process continued for some time, until the charge originally put on the electroscope was discharged.
Conclusions
The data obtained directly contradicts Reich’s data. In the above experiment, there seemed to be no marked difference between the behavior of the cork and the tinfoil, thus yielding no evidence that orgone energy or static electricity attracts organic material and attracts and then repels metallic material.
The classical theory of static electricity easily explains the behavior of the cork and tinfoil. A charged rod contains an excess of electrons, which creates a negative charge on the rod. This negative charge attracts all neutral objects to it. As soon as the smaller object touches the negative sphere, some of the excess electrons flow into the neutral object, giving it a negative charge, because it then has an excess of electrons. The object and the charged sphere are now both negative and hence repel each other. Gradually, the electric charge on the object leaks off, and the object is once more neutral and is attracted to the sphere. This process continues until the charge on the sphere has been sufficiently dissipated.
B. Electroscopic Discharge in the Orgone Accumulator and the Atmosphere
[9]
Problem
As was seen in the previous experiment, Reich believes that what is called “static electricity” and orgone energy are one and the same thing. He claims that the proof of this lies in the fact that the discharge of an electroscope is slower inside of an orgone accumulator than in the atmosphere due to the higher concentration of orgone energy in the accumulator. He reasons as follows:
The energy with which the electroscope was charged will be discharged into the air the more rapidly the lower the energy tension is in the air relative to the charge of the electroscope. Conversely, the energy will be discharged the more slowly the higher the tension is in the surrounding air, that is, the smaller the difference between the energy charge of the electroscope and that of the surrounding air. [10]
 
 The purpose of this experiment was to duplicate Reich’s demonstration of the relative discharges of an electroscope in an orgone accumulator and in the air.
Procedure
Reich does not say whether he used one electroscope first in the air and then in the accumulator, or vice versa, or whether he used two electroscopes at the same time, one in the air and the other in the accumulator. As will be shown later, these and other methodological procedures turn out to be exceedingly important. His general procedure, which was followed accurately, is to charge an electroscope up to the tenth scale division of the particular electroscope he used and then to measure how long it takes for the leaf to fall until it reads the eighth scale division. This time value is obtained from discharging the electroscope both in the air and in the accumulator. The procedure is repeated on various occasions during all kinds of weather.
The glass back of the electroscope used was replaced with a piece of cardboard that had two large holes in it, so that the air in the electroscope could communicate with the outer air as Reich suggests.
In the beginning of the experiment, the following procedure was adopted: the electroscope was charged in the air up to the ninth division on a cardboard scale. The length of time that it took until it discharged to the seventh division was noted. The electroscope was then charged up to the ninth scale division and placed in the orgone accumulator described in a following experiment, and the length of time required for a similar discharge to the seventh scale division was recorded. The procedure was repeated many times a day on different days during varied weather conditions.
The data obtained from this procedure described above for four days are as follows:
Discharge Time in from Room
9-7 (1) 6 minutes 9-7 (1) 4 minutes 9-7 (1) 9 minutes 9-7 (1) 9 minutes 9-7 (1) 3 minutes 9-7 (1) 3 minutes 9-7 (1) 2 minutes
Time in Orgone Accumulator
(2) 15 minutes (2) 10 minutes (2) 21 minutes (2) 21 minutes (2) 8 minutes (2) 9 minutes (2) 8 minutes
This data would indicate that the discharge is slower in an accumulator than in the air, as Reich supports. However, after doing the last run, it suddenly occurred to the writer that perhaps the fact that in every run, the electroscope was first discharged in the air and then discharged in the accumulator might have had some effect on the results. The electroscope was then taken out of the accumulator and recharged immediately in the air and left to discharge. The same discharge which had taken 8 minutes in the accumulator now took 12 minutes in the air! The electroscope was again immediately recharged in the air and the
discharge then took 14 minutes.
 Thus, it became evident that the order of presentation seemed to be at least in part responsible for the slower discharges in the accumulator. Continued experimentation revealed the following facts: if the electroscope is repeatedly charged in the air, the time required for the electroscope to discharge a given unit increases until it reaches a maximum limit which remains fairly constant, as long as the electroscope is immediately charged after being discharged. If the electroscope is not charged for a few hours, the same process is repeated until a maximum limit is again reached.
It became obvious that in order to determine whether the discharge in the accumulator was slower than in the air, it was first necessary to bring the discharge time up to its limit by repeated chargings and dischargings, and when the time was a constant for discharge, then measure the discharge in an accumulator.
Results
Using the above mentioned procedure, the following results were obtained:

Conclusions
It was found that when an electroscope is discharged in the air and then in an orgone accumulator, the discharge in the accumulator is slower. However, it was also found that this effect was at least in part due to the order of presentation, as the time it takes for an electroscope to discharge a given unit increases up to a maximum limit. When the maximum limit was reached in the air and the electroscope was then discharged in an accumulator, it was found that the discharge was not slower in the accumulator but that within the accuracy of the instrument, the data revealed no significant difference in time values.
As Reich makes no mention of the increase in discharge time that was discovered in this experiment, it is possible that his results are due to the mistake of discharging the electroscope first in the air and then in the accumulator before the electroscope has reached its maximum discharge value. It may be that the effect discovered here does not occur with all electroscopes, although the same effort was found to be present with two other electroscopes built differently than the one used here.
(9) 13 minutes
(5) 13 minutes (7) 13 minutes
 The data thus gives no suggestion that any kind of an energy is being concentrated in the orgone accumulator such that it slows the discharge of an electroscope.
III. Thermal Demonstration of Orgone Energy
[11] Problem
Believing that 1) organic substances absorb orgone energy, 2) metallic substances reflect orgone energy, and 3) stoppage of the kinetic energy of the orgone energy results in a temperature rise, Reich has devised an apparatus, namely the Orgone Accumulator, already mentioned, with the electroscopic demonstration of orgone energy, which supposedly accumulates the energy.
The Orgone Accumulator can be made large enough for an individual to sit in, as in the orgone-therapy treatment of cancer patients, or smaller for experimental purposes. The design is simple and is basically a box of any size that is lined with a metallic material such as galvanized sheet iron or metal screen and has an outside layer of a nonconducting substance (what Reich calls “organic”) such as cotton or fiberglass. The accumulator may consist of merely one layer of metallic and nonconducting substances or of many layers. An increase in the number of layers supposedly results in an increase in the orgonotic potential of the atmosphere to the inside of the accumulator and hence a higher concentration of orgone energy. Accumulators used in therapy vary from three to twenty layers.
The purpose of this experiment is to duplicate Reich’s demonstration of the thermal effect of the accumulation of orgone energy. He writes:
The energy particles within the box are thrown from metal wall to metal wall. They are being stopped on all sides. Since heat ascends, any possible temperature rise will be most readily registered above the top metal sheet. There must be a temperature difference between the enclosed air in the cylinder above the accumulator on the one hand and the rest of the room on the other. . . . If our assumptions are correct, the temperature difference must be positive and always present. . . . Measurements taken several times a day over a period of weeks reveal an arithmetic mean of about 0.5degreesC. [12]
Procedure
Following Reich’s description of an experimental Orgone Accumulator used in the thermal demonstration of the energy, a box was built measuring one foot square on the inside, lined with galvanized sheet metal and having five layers of steel wool and fiberglass. The walls were about five inches thick on each side. A metal cylinder about six inches long was connected to the top of the sheet-metal lining. A thermometer, accurate to one tenth of a degree centigrade, was inserted through the top of the cylinder and rested a fraction of an inch above the top piece of the sheet metal of the accumulator.
A control box constructed solely out of organic material was built, and a similar thermometer that had been calibrated with the first thermometer was inserted inside the box. The two boxes were placed at opposite ends of a room. The temperature readings for both boxes were taken regularly several times a day for a period of about three weeks and then every few days for a period of about three months. The two boxes were then placed on a porch that had no heating that was separated from the outside by a screen door. The readings were taken every week for about a month and a half.
 Results
The first readings varied from day to day but all followed a similar pattern. As the room warmed up in the morning from the cold night, the temperature of the accumulator (To) was always slightly lower than the temperature of the control (Tc). In the late afternoon, as the room began to cool, the temperature of the accumulator was slightly higher than the temperature of the control. Thus:
Morning Afternoon (To–Tc)=0 to –2degreesC (To–Tc)=0 to plus 2degreesC
The temperature was negative in the morning and gradually became positive by the afternoon. The maximum difference reached was about 2degreesC.
As at least part of (To–Tc) was due to the fact that the accumulator was a better insulator than the control box and thus lagged behind the warming room in the morning and cooling room in the afternoon, the temperature differences could not show if in addition to the lagging behind of the accumulator a slight amount of heat nevertheless was created in the accumulator.
In order to equalize the insulating properties of both the accumulator and the control, the control box was stuffed with cotton, which further insulated it from the room temperature. In order to vary the insulating effect of the control, the thermometer was fitted loosely so it could either be inserted deeper into the cotton, to increase the insulating effect, or withdrawn, to diminish the insulating effect. The two thermometers now always read exactly the same, at all times of the day, during all kinds of weather, in the room or on the cold porch, where the temperature went to as low as 6degreesC.
Thus, when the insulating effect of the accumulator and the control were equalized:
In All Kinds of Weather and All Times of the Day (To–Tc)=0.0degreesC
Conclusions
According to Reich, Orgone Accumulators work everywhere, yet after constructing a control box to equalize the insulating effect of the Orgone Accumulator, no temperature difference was recorded. The data give no indication that any kind of kinetic energy is being transformed into heat. There appears to be no foundation to the belief that an orgone- energy accumulator concentrates an energy which raises the temperature of the accumulator.
In October 1952, a letter was sent to Reich describing the results of this experiment. He wrote back saying that “severe atmospheric disturbances of the last two years” have seriously upset the temperature differences. If one then assumes that due to atmospheric conditions occurring in 1951 and 1952, orgone energy no longer breaks down into heat, then it is a wonder that such a drastic change in the functioning of orgone energy should not have had equally disastrous effects upon the human organism, as orgone energy is supposed to be the basic energy of life. One would expect mass plagues and outbreaks of disease, cancer, and other maladies during those years, yet the health of humanity during those years did not reveal any observable drastic change.
 It might be mentioned that if such a temperature could be obtained, it would be relatively easy for an engineer to utilize it as a source of power. Such a power would be inexpensive, constant, easy to handle, and more than plentiful. It could transform barren wastes into thriving communities and provide the whole world with a source of energy that would revolutionize modern industry. Yet no such attempt to harness the reported temperature difference seems to have been made by either Reich or his coworkers. To my knowledge, no discussion of the possibilities discussed above have even appeared in the literature dealing with orgone energy. (See bibliography.)
IV. Orgonotic Attraction in the Energy Field of the Orgone Accumulator
[13]
Problem
Reich maintains that the energy field of an orgone accumulator has a specific effect upon a magnetic compass. He writes:
We bring a good magnetic needle close to an orgone accumulator of 1 cubic foot, in the following manner: 1) close to the center of the 4 upper edges, b) close to the center of the lower edges. Result: The magnetic north pole regularly turns toward the center of the upper edges, the magnetic south pole toward the center of the lower edges. Whichever edges we made the upper, lower or side edges, the magnetic needle always reacts as described. Conclusion: The reaction of the energy field of an orgone accumulator is of an orgonotic and not of a magnetic nature. [14]
The purpose of this experiment was to duplicate Reich’s experiment and if similar results were found, to devise a control which would test whether it is the specific structure of a Orgone Accumulator that is yielding the results and not merely the metal in the accumulator.
Procedure
A good magnetic compass was brought to the center of the top edges and then the center of the bottom edges of a one-cubic-foot accumulator, as was described in previous experiments. The accumulator was then turned upside down, and the compass was again brought to the center of the top and bottom edges. The compass was then brought to the top of a piece of sheet metal, one foot square, and then to the bottom. The piece of sheet metal was turned upside down and the procedure repeated.
Results
As Reich indicated, the magnetic north pole always turns to the top of the accumulator and the magnetic south pole to the bottom of the accumulator, regardless of which edges we make the top, bottom, or side. However, identical results are obtained using an ordinary piece of sheet metal. The top of the metal always attracts the magnetic north pole and the bottom the magnetic south pole of the compass.
Conclusions
In neglecting to run a control experiment, Reich makes the assumption that the described effect is due to the orgone accumulator and not merely the metal in the orgone accumulator.
He fails to realize that it is a well-known fact that metal, if left standing (such as the hulls of ships or the metallic structures of sky scrapers), eventually becomes magnetized, just as a piece of metal left in contact with a permanent magnet soon becomes magnetized. If the metal is then reversed, it becomes remagnetized. Reich is correct when he says: “The poles of magnetic attraction (south and north) are not interchangeable, except if one remagnetizes a weaker magnet with a stronger one.” [15] He fails to see that this statement also applies to the earth, which is the stronger magnet, and the sheet metal in the orgone accumulator, which acts as the weaker magnet.
One well-versed in Reich’s theory of orgone energy might argue that the piece of sheet metal used as a control in the above experiment is in fact a one-layer orgone accumulator. It is difficult to see how a straight piece of metal, which supposedly reflects orgone energy on both sides, can accumulate orgone energy. But even if this were the case, then surely Reich’s demonstration does not prove his contention that “The attraction effect of the orgone accumulator, then, is not due to definite parts of the material, and can, therefore, not be of a magnetic nature.” [16] This statement would only be true if a piece of sheet metal by itself did not give the described reaction.
V. The Organization of Matter from Free Orgone Energy
[17]
A. Freezing of Bion Water
[18]
In what Reich calls “Experiment XX,” he believes he has shown that under special conditions, orgone energy organizes itself into matter. He believes that when earth is made to “swell” by boiling or autoclavation, orgone energy is released from the disintegrating dirt, forming what he calls “bion water.” Bion water is yellow, supposedly indicating a high concentration of free orgone energy. When this water is made to freeze, the yellow color contracts into a spot in the center. When thawed, flakes of matter appear. From this, Reich concludes:
The appearance of a concentrated yellow spot in the center of the clear ice admits of only one plausible explanation: The free orgone energy in the freezing water acts exactly like the orgone energy in a freezing organism; contracting, it retracts from where the freezing takes place. [19]
The first part of the experiment attempted to duplicate this demonstration and then to perform a control experiment to determine whether in the freezing of any colored solution the color contracts toward the center, when the solution is composed of a colorless solvent and a colored solution.
Procedure
Bion water was made according to the directions given by Reich:
Ordinary garden soil is put through a screen and thus cleaned of stones, clumps, etc. The sifted garden soil is boiled for an hour in distilled or ordinary water (the procedure followed here—R.S.) or autoclaved for half an hour (at 120degreesC and 15 lb. pressure). The water is filtrated from the boiled soil. This clear fluid we call bion water. [20]
The fluid was then frozen and observed.
 
In the control experiment, potassium permanganate (KMn04) was dissolved in a beaker of water until a purple solution was obtained. This was then frozen, and the behavior of the color observed.
Results
The filtrate of the boiled earth, which Reich calls bion water, appeared yellow. When frozen, the yellow color contracted toward the center of the solution. Exactly the same phenomenon was observed in the freezing of a purple solution of potassium permanganate: the purple color contracted toward the center, forming a deep-purple spot in the clear ice. The thawed bion water revealed flakes.
Conclusion
The bion water was found to be yellow and the yellow color contracted toward the center when the solution was frozen, exactly as described by Reich. However, because the purple color of a solution of a dissolved, colored salt yields the same results, the contraction of the yellow color in no way proves that the yellow color is due to a high concentration of orgone energy or justifies the statement of Reich that: “The appearance of a concentrated yellow spot in the center of the clear ice admits of only one plausible explanation” (emphasis mine—R.S.).
A much more plausible explanation would involve explaining the phenomenon on a molecular and crystalline basis. As the water freezes, the molecules of water are slowed down and form the crystalline structure of ice. As this process develops from the outside of the solution, which is colder, to the inside of the solution, the particles of dissolved coloring matter are forced to the center forming an intensely colored spot.
Reich is convinced that his bion water is “completely free of particles” [21] because it has been filtered. But that is an erroneous assumption. It is common knowledge that plants obtain food from the soil in the form of dissolved minerals. One cannot filter dissolved salts or even large, dissolved, long-chain organic molecules out of a solution. Reich has never even considered the possibility that the color could be from these soluble substances in the earth, of which he makes no mention.
B. The Production of Flakes from Distilled Bion Water
[22] Problem
Reich maintains that “If one distills bion water of about 40 to 50 OP (average concentration of orgone in bion water—R.S.) one finds some flakes immediately after cooling, and numerous flakes after freezing.” [22] This is of vital importance, for if the flakes can be produced from distilled bion water, then clearly the flakes are not due to dissolved particles, as any dissolved matter would not distill over with the water vapor. The purpose of this experiment was to duplicate Reich’s experiment of distilling bion water.
Procedure
Bion water, obtained from a previously described experiment, was distilled, and the distillate carefully observed for signs of flakes. It was then frozen and thawed and again observed for evidence of flakes.
 
Results
 The distillate of the bion water was perfectly clear and showed no signs of flakes. The thawed ice was likewise clear.
Conclusion
The results indicate that the flakes are not found when the bion water is distilled and then frozen and thawed as Reich maintains. This indicates that the flakes obtained in the previous experiment were not caused by any energy being transformed into matter but rather by dissolved substances which precipitated out upon freezing.
Summary
The experiments of Reich, used by him as proof of the existence of orgone energy, fall into two categories. In the first category are those experiments that when duplicated, yield the same results as Reich reports, only by the use of a control experiment, the conclusions that Reich draws from his experiments are invalidated. In this category are the experiments on flickering in the sky, visual phenomenon in an orgone room, the slower discharge of an electroscope in an Orgone Accumulator (if Reich made the methodological error already discussed in that experiment), the orgonotic attraction of a compass in the energy field of an Orgone Accumulator, and the contraction of the yellow color in frozen bion water. In the second category are those experiments that when duplicated do not yield the results that Reich reports. In this category are the experiments on the demonstration of the two basic principles of orgone energy: the thermal demonstration of orgone energy and the production of flakes from distilled bion water.
Eight experiments whose verification are essential to the scientific demonstration of orgone energy as reported by Reich have been duplicated. Orgone energy, with the properties ascribed to it by Reich, either stands or falls on the basis of these experiments. In every case, careful examination of the data in no way proves or even hints at the existence of orgone energy.
The Therapeutic Effect of the Orgone Accumulator
The results of the work described in this paper do not prove that the use of an Orgone Accumulator for therapeutic aid is without benefit. However, whatever effect there may be, it is not due to an energy demonstrable by the means outlined by Reich. In order to prove that the effect of the Orgone Accumulator is not due merely to the fact that it is 1) an enclosed box, and hence a good insulator or 2) lined with metal, which reflects heat well, control experiments must be run. To my knowledge, neither Reich himself nor any of his coworkers have done this. No such experiment has been reported in the literature dealing with orgone energy.

He concludes that of all the new reports of toxic materials in the blood of schizophrenics "there has been no extensive substantiation of any of them" (p. 418). He continues: "Many of the cur- rent hypotheses concerning the schizophre- nia complex are original and attractive even though, up to this time, evidence directly implicating anyone of them in the disease itself is hardly compelling" (p. 426).
If there is no convincing evidence that schizophrenia is an identifiable disease, there is far less scientific support for a sickness model explanation of all of the less extreme forms of human deviation, yet the American Psychiatric Association keeps issuing posi- tion statements claiming responsibility for such conditions as mental retardation, ju- ~enile delinquency, and alcoholism. The
1rouble is that the sickness model demands ;a kind of intervention that is terribly ex- 'PCnsiveand a kind of highly trained inter- vener who is not widely available. Even- tually, I predict, the needs of society will be better served! •
H the organic approach could be demon- .strated to b~ valid our society would be justified in demanding an enormous increase in the number of medical and paramedical professionals prepared to take their places :in the battle against "mental illness." But 'tile organic approach has not been found to ·be convincingly valid, and alternative models ~em to hold ~t least as much promise for helping many 'more disturbed people. Fur-
Look!
With hundreds of thousands of daily drug users in the public hospitals, plus millions more seeking tranquility or at least relief from intense anxiety, the psychotropic drugs have become a fantastic growth industry. Understandably any threat to the sickness model is a threat to the drug salesmen. What is good for General Napoleon is good for United Chemical!
By using drugs for the poor in the state hospitals we can get by with practically no professional personnel in these tax-sup- ported settings. (In over one-third of our state hospitals practically no psychiatric
. time is available, and two-thirds of our 2,000 psychiatric clinics do not have a single full-time psychiatrist on the staff[ 1] ) . Eighty percent of psychiatric practice is pri- vate office practice with a suburban upper- middle class clientele.
Jules Henry (5) says: "State hospitals to- day seem to exhale from their antique bricks and dark labyrinths the miasmas of mis- understanding, prejudice, .callousness, and hate whose origins lie deep in pur history. Who knows what happens in the pit, where their voices do not come up to us?" (p. 48).
The point of all of this argument should not be lost. Psychiatry, in insisting on its prerogatives of primary patient responsibility and control of treatment institutions and intervention efforts of all sorts, bases its argument either on rare and uncertain genetic and metabolic conditions or on those common chronic organic mental conditions which it characteristically neglects. Most of psychiatric practice is private, most of it is suburban, and most hospital psychiatry is practiced in general hospitals. None of the organic mental conditions is the central con- cern of current psychiatric treatment.
A great majority of the people whom psy- chiatrists treat are not suffering from genetic, metabolic, and arteriosclerotic conditions, or from alcoholic delirium, or from central ner- vous system malfunction. If psychiatrists were to devote their primary attention to these kinds of cases there would be little need for today's debate about models. Repeatedly,

arguing for its replacement with a social- developmental model. Certainly the most fundamental contribution of Freud was his discovery of the continuity between the nor- mal and the abnormal. In discussing Dar- win and Freud, Jerome Bruner pointed out that the Victorians, reeling from Darwin's discovery of a perfectly lawful continuity be- tween man and the rest of the animal king- dom, were dealt a second and more terrifying blow by Freud's discovery of the continuity between the sane and the insane. Bruner( 3 ) speaks of the
state hospitals and public clinics would be replaced by social intervention centers, largely staffed by people at the bachelor's level-more like special education teachers and social welfare workers, potentially avail- able in vastly greater supply than psychol- ogists and psychiatrists. For prevention, peo- ple like ourselves would be needed as teachers, researchers, and especially as rad- ical social activists proselytizing for changes in our society to make it more supportive, less dehumanized.
The massive deterioration of the fabric of soc[ety and its institutions results in a com-

animal kihgdom, between dreams and unrea- plex tangle of pathology. The pathology
son on one side and waking rationality on the other, between madness and sanity, between consciousness and unconsciousness; between the mind of the child and the adult mind, be-
includes especially the destruction of the emotional integrity of the family. Let me emphasize here something that you already know very well. Many significant research breakthroughs have already been made. Many of the discoveries are already in. We know, for example, that the emoti6nal cli- mate which surrounds the infant and young child is of critical importance in determining his future-including the kind, the severity, and perhaps even the biological concomi- tants of his later disturbance.
Such knowledge is dangerous. We usually shut our eyes to its implications. We go on trying to fix up damaged adults in one-to- one relationships when a more proper pro- fessional function would be to spend a con- siderable portion of our energies trying to fix up our society in ways that will increase the strength and stability of the family, there- by affecting positively the mental health of generations to come. It is not possible here to further elaborate upon prevention except to say that I believe, because of the nature of the human animal, it must take the form of strengthening the institution of the family.
I believe that history may judge President Johnson to have been one of the most com- plicated of American presidents. But his speech at Howard University's commence- ment will be judged among the half-dozen great landmarks in the history of our society. In it the President called for a massive attack on the central problem of our time. He said:

these has been a cherished discontinuity pre- served in doctrinal canons.
Freud forced the abandonment of thes~ cherished discontinuities.
Why, in the face of this central message of Freud's life work, does the latter-day psy- choanalyst continue to pay homage to the sickness model? Primarily, I think, because of the historical accident which has re- quired the psychoanalyst in the United States to be trained first as a physician. I look for- ward to the day when the psychoanalysts, perhaps in continuing self-analysis, will join forces with Freud and the rest of us who be- lieve the evidence supports a continuity mod- el, a model which holds that it is established that the same mechanisms are operating in adaptive and maladaptive human behavior, and will help lead the scientific assault on those who seek to preserve and defend the sickness model.

the professional fields to be discussed is dependent to a large extent on the pool of college graduates from which graduate and professional school stu- dents are recruited, we will present some data on trends in college enrollments and on considerations which may affect these enrollments. We will also touch on certain factors which may affect the com- petence and also the vocational choice of numbers of college students. We will then proceed to ex- amine briefly trends in the demand for scientific and professional work in the field of mental health. Finally, we will present data on manpower sup-
plies in each of the fields.
THE CRISIS IN EDUCA TION
When we look at enrollment trends in higher edu- cation in the United States, two factors stand out. First, we are wasting enormous amounts of brain power because so many of our bright young people do not receive the training for which they are in- tellectually competent. The shortage of students now finishing college, together with certain other conditions we will mention, means that our coun- try is faced for the next few years with a severe shortage of students in graduate and professional schools. Second, because of a marked rise in the birth rate beginning in the 1940's, we can expect a substantial rise in college enrollments within the
next decade. While this prospect of increasing en- rollments may appear to offer an eventual solution to the problem of shortages, we must keep in mind the increase in the country's population which will create greater demands for professional services. There is real danger that our educational system

facets of our problem in higher education.
Current shortages. A large proportion of bright young people in our society, for one reason or an- other, drop out of school before completing the twelfth grade. Of those who finish high school, many who have the ability to enter college do not enroll. Of those who do begin college, many do not graduate. Wolfle (38) tells us that of the brightest fifth of our young people only one-third finish col- lege. Even among the most able one per cent of our young people, less than two-thirds finish college. The proportion of students with lesser, but ade- quate, ability who finish college is correspondingly
lower.
The number of college graduates is dependent on
the number who are able scholastically and finan- cially to enroll, of course, but also this number is dependent on how many young people of college age there are in the population. This means that, other things being equal, the number of freshman college students is directly related to the number of babies born some eighteen years before. For the past eight years those reaching college age were born in the 1930's when there was an ebb in the na- tional birth rate. There was an artificial rise in enrollment for several years after the war, but for the past few years the number of college graduates has been falling. In all probability we have now
nearly reached the lowest point in numbers of col- lege graduates, and the curve will begin to rise, slowly for a time and then more rapidly.
What do these facts mean for graduate and pro- fessional education? For one thing, they mean that there are fewer college graduates now than at any time in the past five years, and that this small pool of college graduates will rise only slowly for the next decade. This is serious because it means
57
 S8 THE AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGIST
that there are, and will be, fewer students to go around to fill places in graduate and professional schools at a time when there is great social pres- sure to expand training programs.
One of the main reasons for the well-publicized shortage of engineers, teachers, scientists, and tech- nicians is to be found in this short supply of col- lege graduates. Naturally, the shortage also af- fects the recruitment of students by schools train- ing personnel in the mental health professions.
A corollary effect concerns student quality. The elementary fact is that a decrease in the pool of prospective advanced students means increased competition among professions and among profes- sional schools for the fewer college graduates, with the result that admissions standards are sometimes lowered in order to keep vacancies from developing beyond acceptable limits.
A final factor influencing the potential pool of advanced students is the present high prosperity level. We have all seen the pictures of industry representatives bidding for science and mathematics bachelors, and we have read the advertisements for science majors and technicians in our newspapers. But the job market is good for other college gradu- ates as well. Many new college graduates who, in leaner years, might go on to graduate or profes- sional school are swept off their feet by the pros-

pect of an early and painless short cut to suburbia. Prospects for the future. Educators are losing sleep over the steadily swelling enrollments in the elementary schools and are trying desperately to patch the seams of bursting schools while they re- cruit hastily retreaded teachers to fill in the second shifts (48). Although many able students drop out along the way the large increase in school en- rollments means that more students are now reach-
ing high school than ever before.
The trend over the years has been for more and
more high school graduates to enroll in college. At the beginning of the present century only one high school graduate in twenty started college. Today, roughly a third enroll in institutions of higher edu- cation. The American Council on Education (1) predicts that this trend will continue to increase and quotes the American Association of College Registrars and Admission Officers as predicting the proportion will reach SOper cent in the next dec- ade. Two years ago the American Council on Edu- cation (32) had this to say: "If added to the 70 per cent increase in number of college-age youth, we continue to admit into our colleges and universi- ties an increasing percentage of high school gradu- ates, we shall enroll in higher institutions in 1970, at least twice our present number of students."

graduates (in smaller scale) for the past fifteen

years and for the next ten years. It will be ap-
parent from this figure that the drop in numbers of college graduates from the postwar peak is deceler- ating and that the curve will soon turn upward (with a four-year lag) to follow the rising number of high school graduates.
However optimistic this trend toward increased college enrollments appears, the fact remains that we could, if we chose, take steps to encourage large numbers of bright young people who now drop out before finishing high school to stay and graduate. This would still further increase future college en- rollments. We could, if we made a massive effort, nearly quadruple rather than double the number of college students by 1970, without any sacrifice in quality.
As the situation stands, our colleges and universi- ties, experiencing relatively lean years since the ebbing of the flood of students following the war, look with mixed feelings at the gradually rising numbers of freshmen now reaching the campuses. Looking ahead, institutions of higher education have, understandably, some satisfaction in antici- pating the oncoming tide as a source of increased income from tuition. But they see too the prob- lems to be faced in trying to educate students with, in too many cases, broad gaps in their preparation for college, especially in the areas of mathematics and the sciences (13, 49, 50). More importantly perhaps, the faculties who stand ready to face the doubled classes have been weakened by the loss of many of their number to the financial lures and fringe benefits of industry and government service
(13).
To make the massive effort required to give edu-
cational opportunities to all those who are intel- lectually qualified, would require tremendous ex- pansion and improvement of the whole educational system.

THE DEMAND FOR TRAINED PERSONNEL IN THE FIELD OF MENTAL HEALTH
There is no simple way to assess the present na- tional shortages of trained personnel in the mental health professions. A number of estimates has been made for the separate professions and we will present some of these later.
From time to time a spokesman for one of the mental health professions, or an official of a mental health movement, or a foundation concerned with large social problems, speaks out about "the prob- lem of mental illness." Usually, figures are quoted. Somehow, in this age, we have become blase or bored with figures. Yet no one has found a better way to describe the dimensions of the problem. We all know, by now, that of every ten babies born this year, one will spend some time in a mental in- stitution (24). We know that the Federal govern- ment is spending more for the care and support of psychiatric casualties among veterans than all the states combined are spending on the hospitalization of nonveterans (43), and yet we realize that the cost of our present care of people in state institu- tions, even though grossly inadequate, runs as high as one-third of the operating budget of some large and wealthy states (17). And we know that for every one of our 700,000 mental hospital inmates, there is in the community another serious case for whom there is no bed (17).
The demand for mental health personnel is not limited, of course, to those people whose disorders require separation from society. There are other vast numbers of seriously maladjusted people who need help, directly or indirectly. One in five young men of military age will enter the service with a juvenile court record; a million of our citizens are severe, chronic alcoholics, not to mention the prob- lem drinkers; one in four of our marriages will end in divorce; untold numbers suffer from incapaci- tating neuroses or emotionally aggravated physical illnesses.
Perhaps we have quoted enough figures to give some indication of the dimensions of the present problem. For the future, the prospects are even grimmer.
As our population increases, the number of first admissions to state hospitals increases. We have, it is true, stepped up somewhat the rate of dis- charges from our mental institutions over the past twenty years (Figure 2), but any ground gained

thereby is lost by the increasing rate of mental dis- order in the population (Figure 3). We chose these data on admissions and discharges to state hospitals because they were easily available. But we can be quite sure that there are similar in- creases in the neuroses, in alcoholism, and in other forms of disorder as well.
So far, we have only quoted data which indicate the numbers of people who need, or will need, pro- fessional help. But if we are to avoid an endless treadmill, it will be apparent that an even more basic need is for research personnel. At present,
less than one per cent of our total expendituresin the field of mental disorder goes into research (25). Yet research offers the only hope for eventual relief of a share of this problem. Research means highly trained people, and again we meet a demand for personnel.
Let us now look at the supply of people avail- able for work in the mental health fields.
PSYCHIATRISTS
There are, roughly, ten thousand psychiatrists in the United States. Everyone agrees that this is not

 nearly enough. For the country as a whole, there is one psychiatrist for every sixteen thousand peo- ple. Clearly this is an alarming ratio. In 1953 a Congressional Inquiry on Mental Illness (45) con- cluded with the judgment that we need twice as many psychiatrists at once. There is little reason to believe that we shall find them. Blain (3) points out that after allowing for loss due to death and retirement from the field, we are presently gaining about 450 psychiatrists a year. At this rate, he figures that it will be twenty years before we double the number of psychiatrists in this country. But as our population continues to grow too, and as the rate of mental disorder in the population continues to increase (Figure 3), the need rises along with the supply of psychiatrists.
There are facts which make Blain's figures on our rate of gain in psychiatry cause for even more con- cern. Gorman (17) calls attention to the follow- ing: "Of the approximately 450 doctors [each year] who complete the three-year psychiatric residency, an average of 250 go into private practice. This leaves public psychiatry with about 200 recruits, little more than enough to replace the older psy- chiatrists who die off or retire."
There is a further effect of the tendency of the new psychiatrist to go into private practice show- ing up in the shortage of research personnel in psychiatry. Research in psychiatry requires even
further specialized training and experience. The Group for the Advancement of Psychiatry (18) notes that: "Despite increased facilities and sums available for research in psychiatry, the present trend of psychiatric trainees is to enter into the private practice of psychiatry, with emphasis on psychotherapy and the shock therapies, rather than to undertake research."
There is another pessimistic factor to be con- sidered. A sizable number (20 per cent to 25 per cent—see below) of residents in psychiatry are non- resident aliens who return home after their train- ing, reducing still further the number of psychia- trists available for public institutions and agencies.
It is clear that we cannot help but fall behind even the present inadequate psychiatrist-patient ratios in our public institutions. One result is that, as states appropriate more funds to their depart- ments of mental health, they begin to compete with each other for personnel. Time (47) quotes Indi- ana's Governor Craig: "Eventually we will have to stop this bidding against each other. There has to be some common ground of salaries and mutual consideration. . . . These interstate raids on men- tal-health institutions for personnel sometimes get to be like the raids to build up rival football teams."
In some areas of the country the shortage of psychiatrists is much more acute than the national average. Felix (12) has called attention to the

situation in the southern region where a survey of sixteen states indicates an immediate need for five times as many psychiatrists as are presently available.
What possible approaches are there to alleviat- ing this critical shortage? Among those most often mentioned is the suggestion that we expand our programs for training psychiatrists, and attract more physicians, especially new medical school graduates, into the field.
What are our chances of increasing, really sig- nificantly, the number of psychiatrists in relation to our need for psychiatric service?
The supply of psychiatrists is linked in a very real sense to the supply of physicians, and to the number of young physicians who decide to spe- cialize in psychiatry. Despite strenuous efforts made in recent years to encourage more young physicians to enter into psychiatric residencies, there has been no proportionate increase and, in fact, there has been some ground lost in the past three years. Figure 4 shows the total number of residencies offered in four important medical spe- cialties over the past few years, and indicates no relative gain by psychiatry. For many years the proportion of physicians indicating a limited spe- cialty in psychiatry has remained quite constant between the limits of 54 per cent to 7 per cent (36).

Another indication of the fairly level output of 125.8 per cent. In 1910 there were 3,165 physi-
trained psychiatrists is the number who pass the examinations of the American Board of Examiners in Psychiatry and Neurology each year. Figure 5 illustrates these figures and also shows the even lower level of output in neurology. The number who pass both specialties together is negligible.
Because the supply of psychiatrists is so bound to the supply of physicians, we may well look fur- ther at the latter. Few subjects are so loaded with potential for polemics as the question of whether or not there are enough physicians in this country and whether or not their numbers are increasing or decreasing in comparison with the growth of our population. One of the favorite arguments for ad- vocates of either point of view is to engage in com- parisons between "then and now." The problem is how to choose the most equitable "then." For ex- ample, Turner (33) argues that there are increas- ing numbers of physicians being trained. He says, "While the population of the nation has approxi- mately doubled during this period [1900-1954], in
cians graduated from approved medical schools as compared to 6,861 in 1954, the latter figure repre- senting an increase of 114.8 per cent."3
The trouble, if there is trouble, with Turner's argument is to be found in the expression "ap- proved schools of medicine." In 1910 Flexner
(14) published a monumental report of an in- vestigation of medical schools. He classed 66 as Class A "Approved" schools and 65 as Class B and C "Unapproved" schools. The "Unapproved" schools had, that year, an enrollment of 8,996 students, which, if added to that in "Approved" schools, brings the total enrollment up to 21,526. This figure, if used as a basis for comparison, would mean an increase in enrollment of only 35.8 per cent instead of the 125.8 per cent (125.28 per cent) quoted above. The "Unapproved" schools graduated 1,275 physicians in 1910 making a total

prospects are that we will lose ground when the advantage of increased enrollments and the recent founding of new medical schools are offset by popu- lation increases.

ratio was 1.97to 1." They go on to point out that if the fall in applicants continues just a few more years there will not be enough people to fill medical school vacancies. Other medical educators, writing in the Journal oj Medical Education, warn that "the caliber of applicants to medical schools is falling" (15), and that some schools withgeo- graphic restrictions "had to 'scrape the bottom of the barrel'" (31). We conclude that for the next few years at least, the prospects are not favorable for a major increase in medical school enrollments.
These facts and trends in the supply of physi- cians and medical school enrollments indicate that there is little likelihood of the kind of increase that would be needed to result in a substantial rise in the number of psychiatrists. Increasing justmod- erately the number of medical school graduates would only slightly affect the number of newpsy- chiatric residents because, as a rule of thumb, the number of first-year residents in psychiatry each year is less than 10 per cent of medical school graduation figures.
There is, however, another source of psychiatric residents, and of residents in other specialties as well, which has appeared in recent years. Alien physicians, in increasing numbers, have been ac-
cepted as interns and residents in hospitals in this country. During the past five years the number of alien physicians in all residencies has increased from 8 per cent to 22 per cent. Most of these alien physicians have entered the U. S. under provisions of the U. S. Information and Exchange Act of1948.
Some 20 per cent to 25 per cent of the physicians now in residencies in psychiatry are from abroad and will return home when their training iscom- pleted ( 7 ) . While they offer service during their stay here, they do not represent any permanent in- crease in psychiatric manpower and actually their numbers inflate artificially figures on psychiatric residents in training.
PSYCHOLOGISTS
It is more difficult to define a psychologist than a psychiatrist and meaningful data are harder to obtain for psychology. While many persons em- ployed as psychiatrists have not had as muchspe- cialized training in psychiatry as leaders in the field might prescribe, at least a specified minimum of training is required in that all psychiatrists are physicians and have had the extensive clinical con- tact with patients that medical training involves. Psychology, on the other hand, is a broader and • more loosely denned field in which are employed people with various amounts of formal training. In this respect psychology is more like such spe- cialties as chemistry or engineering than it is like psychiatry.
A second difficulty, for our present purposes, in- volves deciding what proportion of psychologists may be considered to be in the field of mental health. Should we include only clinical psycholo- gists? Certainly people working in vocational guidance, in school psychology, and even some of those concerned with such areas as morale and motivation of military personnel, to cite but a few examples, may be thought of as contributing to mental health. There is no question but that a sizable number of psychologists would argue that they have no direct, and scarcely any indirect, con- cern with mental health. The scientist studying color vision, or the rodentologist with his T-maze, is not likely to welcome classificatory bedfellowship with the professional tester or counselor.
In some of the data we will present below we will use figures based on membership in the Ameri- can Psychological Association. Our rationalization
 is as follows: over half of the membership of APA is in clinical psychology or closely related areas (30). The total membership of APA is estimated to number about one-half of those employed in this country as psychologists (39). The reader should keep in mind that a sizable proportion of APA members have little or nothing to do with mental health, but that a sizable number of psychologists who are employed in the mental health field are not APA members. The exactness of the balance of these two groups is almost impossible to assess.
What sort of demands for services of psycholo- gists exists in the field of mental health? Once again one has a choice of estimates (2, 3, 11, 12, 20, 28). It is probably safe to say that existing needs could absorb easily an additional ten thou- sand trained people.
Most studies emphasize the need for people at the doctorate level. The Committee on Specialized Personnel of the Office of Defense Mobilization
(28) estimates that PhD's with research experi- ence are in shortest supply, particularly in physio- logical and experimental psychology. On the other hand, the Veterans Administration, projecting its needs for the next decade, indicates a continuing serious shortage of PhD-level clinical psychologists (see Figure 8). Felix (12) says that the southern region (sixteen states) needs seven times as many

clinical psychologists as are now employed, and that eleven western states need a total of 2,000 clinical psychologists.
There is a pervasive belief among psychologists that psychology is one of the fastest-growing fields of specialization. Sanford (29) noted in 1951 that the membership of APA increased nearly twenty- fold in a quarter century. He quotes the extrapo- lation of psychology's growth curve by Boring in which the latter predicts 59 million psychologists a century hence. Carrying the extrapolation fur- ther, Sanford notes that the number of psycholo- gists will catch up with the world's population in less than 150 years! Fortunately, perhaps, there are signs that we are slowing down. Wolfle (39) has shown that the notion of very rapid growth in psychology is only partially true.
For each year of the past five years the number of new Associates of APA has remained fairly con- stant at about 1,300. Figure 9 illustrates the growth of the APA and, for contrast, the growth of the American Psychiatric Association. If, how- ever, we look at the number of PhD's in psychol- ogy and the number of first-year residents in psy- chiatry we see no startling gain for either group
(Figure 10).
Will our universities be able to turn out enough
people to fill the present and projected need for psychologists? The best predictions are that for the next few years we will not step up the number

ogy can expand training programs somewhat more readily as more qualified college graduates are at- tracted to the field. The more serious limitation on numbers of psychologists trained is the supply of college graduates forming the pool of potential graduate students, especially the number of p s y - chology majors. Figure 11 contrasts the numbers of bachelor's, master's, and doctor's degrees c o n - ferred in psychology since 1947-48. It will be noted that while there has been a steady increase in the number of doctorates conferred in psychol- ogy, the number of bachelor's degrees has declined along with the decline in college graduates in gen- eral. It seems certain that the next several years will see a drop, or at least a leveling off, in num- bers of doctorates as graduate school enrollments fall off with the shortage of college graduates we have noted.
A further problem that promises to affect p s y - chology somewhat more than the other mental health fields is the oncoming tide of college s t u - dents described above. The psychologist tradi- tionally has been a teacher, and as psychology is one of the most popular undergraduate subjects there will be an increased demand for college teachers of psychology. This increased demand will follow a decade or so of fairly low-levelpro- duction of doctorates in psychology.
What can the field of psychology do in the face of these prospects of shortages and static output? Is there any way to increase the number of trained psychologists? One thing which comes to mind at once is the value of taking steps now to get infor- mation about scientific and professional opportuni- ties in psychology to students who have not yet chosen their career, and to students majoring in psychology who are not well acquainted with the possibilities of further training. The recent Public Affairs Pamphlet on psychology ( 2 6 ) is one small step in the right direction. Despite the low tide of college students now enrolled, psychology should be able to attract a somewhat larger proportionof able students. Psychology, it should be noted, is the only one of the mental health professions that
has real continuing access to the attention of large numbers of college students before they have made firm decisions on their careers.
More psychology undergraduates might go on to graduate school if large university departments im- proved their contact with these students. Wolfle

of doctorates (39). In fact there will probably be some decline for a time.
University training centers for psychologists en- joy a certain advantage over psychiatric training centers from the point of view of flexibility in ex- panding training programs. While psychiatry must depend on the supply of physicians for its recruits, and also must depend on specialists who are in short supply for its training supervisors, psychol-

FIG. 11. Degree recipients in psychology.
(39) notes that only 12 per cent of students who
 major in psychology have become professional psy- chologists. But as psychology bachelors comprise a representative cross-section of ability of all those receiving bachelor's degrees, many more than 12 per cent have the intellectual ability to succeed in graduate school (39).
Whatever we do to increase graduate enrollments during the next decade the shortage of psycholo- gists is likely to continue. Some ten to twenty years hence we should be able to increase sizably our output of doctorates. But as we have noted, demands increase as our population increases. There seems little chance that we will have enough psychologists even then.
SOCIAL WORKERS
It was harder to define who is a psychologist than who is a psychiatrist. It is harder still to de- fine who is a social worker.
According to Kendall (21), 'It has been esti- mated that there are approximately 75,000 persons employed in social work positions in the United States, of whom 16 per cent have completed two or more years of graduate study, 11 per cent have had one, but less than two years, 13 per cent have had less than one year, and 60 per cent have had no social work education."
We will be guided in our considerations of num- bers of social workers, and trends in their number, by statements of leaders of the profession itself as to who are social workers. Youngdahl (41) says, "At present the established norm for professional training consists of two years of graduate profes- sional training in an accredited school of social work." This definition agrees with the one used by the Health Resources Advisory Committee (20).
What is the present need for social workers in the mental health field? Let us turn once more to our sources and select some typical estimates. Blain (3) sees a need for 9,000 psychiatric social workers and figures it will take 20 years to find this number. The present shortage in state-sup- ported mental hospitals alone is approximately 7,000 (2) which represents a 75 per cent under- staffing (24). Gorman (17) counts only 800 psy- chiatric social workers in state institutions, which represents an even greater understaffing. At this rate, each social worker has, on the average, re-
sponsibility for six hundred patients. In 1952 there were 2,500 budgeted job vacancies for medi- cal and psychiatric social workers in this country
and a projected need for 4,200 more within five years (20). In these two specialties alone it is estimated that there is a deficit of at least 1,000 each year even if every graduate goes to work (20). Comparable shortages exist in all other fields of social work (12, 16, 21). The Council on Social Work Education (5) estimates that 50,000 new so- cial workers will be needed in the next decade, be- yond those who may leave the field.
How many social workers are being trained? Figure 12 illustrates the ten-year trend in num- bers of full-time students and graduates from two- year programs as compiled by the Council on So- cial Work Education. Once again we observe the postwar rise, but the decline has come earlier in social work than in the other two fields we have studied. From what we have said about the pool of potential professional school students, it will be apparent that the rise in numbers of social work students will be slow. Different specialties within social work show different trends. There has been a decrease in field placements in medical social work and in group work over the past four years and a slight increase in field placements in psychi- atric social work during this same time. All other fields of social work have about held their own (6).

Flo. 12. Students and graduates of two-year social work programs.
 68 THE AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGIST
A survey in 1952 of 24 schools of social work with approved medical social work curricula showed that the number of students enrolled in this spe- cialty fell short of capacity by 42 per cent, while other schools without specialized curricula but with medical social work field placements were 58 per cent below capacity. It is estimated that these discrepancies between enrollment and vacancies still exist (20) and it is our impression that similar vacancies exist in other social work specialties. Kendall (21) notes that "many of the graduate schools are operating at less than full capacity."
Many reasons have been suggested for the diffi- culties in recruiting social work students and for the growing shortages in the field. One fact is that a high proportion of members of the profession are women (20) who leave the field. Other factors have been suggested by Eaton (9) and include low pay, prestige conflicts, and multiple identifications.
Leaders in social work are trying to step up re- cruitment activities. Among the more frequent ef- forts are programs of on-the-job training for col- lege students during the summer, workshops for college teachers in sociology and anthropology, visits by social work faculty to career conferences on college campuses, and work-study programs for those who cannot afford to spend two years in full- time graduate school study. It should be noted that this last effort, work-study programs, does little to increase the number of social workers, as a majority taking part in these programs are al- ready in the field.
Nothing in view leads to optimistic predictions concerning the problem of finding students for so- cial work in the numbers that are needed. Leaders in the field are making all sorts of active and imaginative efforts, however, and the other profes- sions can learn much from social work in this re- spect.
DISCUSSION
Let us review briefly the important points bear- ing on manpower trends and prospects in the three disciplines we have discussed.
We believe that there is wholehearted unanimity among knowledgeable people about the staggering dimensions of the mental health needs of the na- tion. From whatever viewpoint, be it humani- tarian, economic, or scientific, mental disorder is far and away our number one health problem. It
is real, it is now, and it will not go away. It will only get worse.
Everyone who is aware of the problem agrees that the need for trained professional personnel in the mental health field is desperate. The stark re- ality is that we cannot even keep up present num- bers in proportion to the population. We have not found a single optimistic voice. Occasionally some- one suggests a crash program with recruiting drives, publicity, subsidized training, and special induce- ments to lure more students into training programs. If the mental health professions were the only ones where personnel shortages existed, such pro- grams might be effective in increasing our output of trained people a few years hence. But shortages are not specific to our own fields. They are part of a more pervading shortage of scientific and professional personnel in general. Our pessimistic facts are duplicated in the shortages of teachers, nurses, engineers, and scientists.
But there must be other solutions to the mental health problem. Typhoid fever was not controlled by treating the disease. What about mental health research leading to prevention, or faster cures? As Hastings (19) puts it: "Without more basic knowl- edge than we have today or are now accumulating, the people who follow us fifty years hence will be struggling with the same problems that we are. The almost limitless future for the psychological sciences in the years ahead lies along the avenue of well-planned research activity done by many disciplines."
Psychologists probably receive more formal re- search training than do members of the other two fields. But it is our general impression, and this would be readily testable, that there is an inverse relation between the amount of time psychologists spend on basic research and their proximity to the field of mental health. The clinical psychologist all too often is loaded with service responsibilities, and his research, when he finds time for it, is likely to be concerned with evaluating or improving his skills and techniques rather than being a more basic attack on etiology or pathology. The social worker, too, is trained for service, and despite the growing emphasis on a research orientation in the social work curriculum, a scanning of the social work journals fails to turn up any really basic re- search. We have already noted the shortage of research-oriented psychiatrists.
In recent months there has been a wave of en-
 thusiasm for the tranquilizing drugs as an aid to speedier and more effective therapy. These early reports would seem to be encouraging indications that research can be productive even at the present rate of expenditure. Let us hope fervently that the reports are all based on careful study, though experience warns us to be cautious about such en- thusiasms. The memory of "focal infections" and "rest cures" and even electroconvulsive therapy bids us be careful. Worse still, if the new drugs fulfill even a portion of their promise we will be worse off than before, for most everyone agrees that the drugs are effective only in combination with psychotherapy. So hospitalized patients who formerly did not see a psychiatrist for long periods are now lining up outside his door.
Much is already known about mental disorder. Whether we agree about causes, at least we can agree that there probably are prophylactic and pre- ventive measures which can be effective if used early enough. One of the important aspects of pre- vention is work with children, or with parents in order to reach children. Again, while there are notable exceptions, and in this area perhaps a few exceptional people can be most influential, we find the usual shortages and lack of interest. Blain
(3) despairs at the trickle of child psychiatrists being turned out—some forty a year—and shows that at this rate of production it will take fifteen years to provide one child psychiatrist each for the 600 clinics needed today, not to mention the de- mands of children's residential homes, juvenile courts, school systems, etc. Similar shortages exist for child workers in the other mental health professions.
What is left? One fairly radical proposal has been made by Hastings (19) (though he credits the idea to Kubie and others). He suggests the creation of a new professional group, trained as psychotherapists, though not required to master all of the knowledge presently in the various profes- sional curricula. These people, who could be trained much more rapidly than can a psychiatrist or a psychologist, would not take over completely the field of therapy but would augment present per- sonnel and perhaps free more highly trained people for research. The obstacles to the implementation of this suggestion are enormous, as Hastings recog- nizes. Another profession on the scene might even increase present shortages in the established pro- fessions, and resistance from many quarters to such
infringement on sovereignty would be strong. But the suggestion is an intriguing one, and what we need (besides personnel, money, facilities, and skill) are ideas which can be implemented.
We can only conclude this survey with the pre- diction that our country will continue to be faced with personnel shortages in psychiatry, psychology, and social work for years to come. Barring the possibility of a massive national effort in all areas of education, or the possibility of a sharp break- through in mental health research, the prospects are pessimistic for improvements in the quantity or quality of service in the field of mental health.

Such a conference was held April 18-20, 1969, arranged for and chaired by George Albee. A report of this conference was prepared by Albcc and was presented to the Board of Directors at its meeting on May 1S-T7, 1969. After careful consideration of the
Report of the Conference, the report was "Received with lhanks by the Al'A Board of Directors and was referred to the APA governance for study and recommendation,noting that individuals in the field and in funding agencies should also play a role." Such action by the Board of Directors will insure continued attention by APA boards and com- mittees to those appropriate matters and issues discussed with representatives of the Association of Black Psycholo- gists and to the mallei's symbolized by the Statement of Concern.

Chairmen, and the Committee on Equality of Op- portunity in .Psychology, invited persons with special technical competence, and resource people from Federal agencies and from the staff of APA.
In the course of the discussions the Conference participants became increasingly aware of the ex- tent of underrepresentation of minority groups in psychology; they became impressed, too, with the urgency with which those in American psychology must act both to put our own house in order and to set an example to other organizations that may be expected to be encouraged to follow our lead. For example, we were impressed with the facts, well documented by the Committee on Equality of Opportunity in Psychology, that the 10 most prestigious departments of psychology in the United States granted only 8 PhDs in psychology to Negro candidates between 1920 and 1966 while granting a total of 3,767 PhDs during this period; six of these leading departments had not had a single Negro PhD. Of the largest producers of PhDs during this period fewer than 1 % of the doctorates were won by black students. (Tt is these same departments, we cannot resist noting, that supply the bulk of psychological consultation to Federal
training and research programs.)
The Conference participants are aware of the
fact that deeply held attitudes and behavior pat- terns cannot be legislated out of existence and that pious platitudes cannot change the world. But we also are aware that leaders who truly lead can often mobilize widespread readiness for positive action, and so we urge the APA Council, boards, and committees, and our whole organizational and staff structure, to provide leadership in expanding the opportunities for black and other minority group students and faculty to enter the mainstream of psychology.
The tenor of the discussion was serious and con- cerned, and seldom unreasonable. Participants generally agreed that large efforts had to be made at all levels—making opportunities available in

 graduate departments for qualified black and other minority group students, with special financial as- sistance earmarked; improving the quality of under- graduate education in psychology at predominant!}' black colleges; recruiting more able undergraduates to these departments; improving the educational opportunities in elementary and secondary schools for disadvantaged students; and working to elimi- nate the effects of racism throughout our society. At the same time it was recognized that there is an important substantive body of knowledge in psy- chology and that graduate work makes strenuous
demands. One of the black participants said it well: "There is a great need to avoid the encourage- ment, implicit or otherwise, of 'half-baked,' non- scientific black departments of psychology for the production of instant black psychologists whose only forte would be some vague 'community psy- chology'." This same man spoke of the urgency of "recruiting and holding capable faculty mem- bers, updating and in most instances creating adequate facilities for laboratory experiences, up- dating and increasing library resources, and offering financial support to students who frequently are indigent."
We were impressed with the findings of the Wispe Committee on Equal Opportunities that more than half of all Negro psychologists live in the South, and an even higher percentage were born there and received their bachelor's degrees there. We agree with this Committee that "More active steps should be taken . . . to recruit and train for careers in psychology graduates from Negro colleges, especially located in the South."
studying the problems of recruiting minority group students for careers in psychology, and is presently preparing a proposal that, after being approved by APA governance, will go to the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH). Tt is the belief of the Committee that existing programs such as the National Science Foundation Visiting Scientist Pro- gram, the Careers-in-Psychology program, etc., are not especially suitable for this purpose; their proposal will use integrated visiting teams carrying out a carefully planned program.
We note the encouraging fact that the prestigious Council of Graduate Department Chairmen has appointed a committee to concern itself with ways of encouraging the admission of more black and other minority group students into graduate study in psychology. We urge this organization to find creative ways quickly, and we concur with the recommendation of the Wispe Committee that "More elasticity in admission requirements for graduate training should be considered by the . . . Conference of Graduate Department Chairmen."
The matter of admission requirements, par- ticularly the predictive value of highly verbal tests, is a complex subject, but the Conference spent some time discussing these problems. While recognizing that verbal tests are unquestionably predictive of college and graduate school grades in a system that emphasizes verbal performance, the Conference also noted the relatively low predictive value of graduate school classroom performance for later scientific or professional success.

The Committee on Equal Opportunities has been as they begin to approximate scientific and profes-
on ultimate career patterns.
In this regard there was discussion of the ques-
tion of the relevance of much of the content of graduate education in psychology to critical human problems on which man's survival itself may de- pend—problems like war, overpopulation, racism, and the increasing pollution of our social and physical environment. APA cannot tell university departments what to teach, but we do know enough about reinforcement theory to suggest that both

sional concern with these problems. We note with approval that the theme of the 1969 Annual ATA Convention is "Psychology and Problems of So- ciety."
Each board and committee, each division of APA, and each state psychological association should examine its current activities and its com- mittee structure to see what steps it can take to deal with current problems of the black psycholog- ical community.
We encourage divisions and stale associations to devote more attention in their newsletters and at their annual programs to the creation of a climate that encourages the application of psychological research and knowledge to reduce racism and the problems it creates. We would hope, for example, that those divisions and state associations that sponsor postdoctoral institutes and workshops might devote time to the psychological aspects of racism.
We suggest that divisional and state psycholog- ical groups consider what they might do to acquaint qualified minority group students in high schools and colleges with career opportunities in psy- chology; we recommend also that some of the obvious energies of the state associations, so long expended in legislative and other professional matters, be directed toward finding creative ways of increasing the number of disadvantaged students in undergraduate and graduate programs in psy- chology and increasing the participation of black psychologists in psychological association programs.
Among the other recommendations coming out of the Conference are the following:
We would ask APA to recommend that NTMH add extra stipends to existing training grants, stipends specifically earmarked for higher risk minority group students who might be encouraged in some cases to spend a "bridge year" in courses selected as preparatory to graduate study.
We further urge that APA use its influence with NIMH, the Office of Education, and the Social Rehabilitation Service to seek new and effective ways to fund programs for minority group students, especially at the undergraduate level, with the goal of increasing the pool of potential graduate students for the human service professions. Such support might carry over to the early years of graduate school in the way Social Science Research Council support is now given.
In this context we would also ask that Federal granting agencies make a more effective effort at involving qualified black and other minority group psychologists and social scientists on their panels, study sections, and staffs. As noted elsewhere in this report the most prestigious universities, which supply a large proportion of government consult- ants and panel members, have not been distinguished as producers of black PhDs and so may not be expected to have special qualifications in this gen- eral area.
The Education and Training Board of APA has extensive contacts with nearly every graduate doc- toral program in the country. Questions asked by its site visitors receive careful attention and may promote desirable changes. While the Education and Training Board cannot and should not dictate admissions or patterns of graduate training it could seek out and encourage demonstration programs more consistent with the needs of minority group students and experimentation with curriculum changes.
As another example of what APA could do, the Committee on Subdoctoral Education in Psychology could develop recommendations for special pro- grams designed to remedy critical shortages in such fields as MA-level black counselors for community colleges or of Mexican-American and Puerto Rican school psychologists. The various curriculum pro- grams being developed can focus on problems of relevance and also on recruitment of minority group students. It is expected that representatives of the Association of Black Psychologists and other minority groups might make useful contributions to these developments.
The AP A Committee on Precollege Psychology and the Division 2 Committee on Psychology in the High Schools could pay special attention to the problems of largely black or Mexican-American or Puerto Rican high schools.
We cite these merely as examples of actions pos- sible at many levels of APA governance structure.
One of the recurring themes throughout the Conference was the urgent need for black role models in psychology—persons who might be ex- amples to black undergraduates of the opportunities available to them in psychology. Because of the relatively small number of black psychologists and especially black college teachers, and because the large and affluent largely white universities are
 hiring black faculty away from the predominantly black southern colleges, this is an increasingly serious need.
We recommend that APA develop a series of training films featuring black and other minority group psychologists for use in classrooms in both largely black and largely white institutions. APA's demonstrated competence in this area (e.g., "Focus on Behavior") and the potential attractiveness of such a project to NIMH suggest that this proposal be given high priority by the Board.
Numerous other examples will occur to members of various boards and committees to whom we hope the Board will direct proposals for action.
The Conference noted with concern the fact that a large number of black psychologists belong neither to APA nor to state or local psychological associations. While there may have been good reasons in the past why these psychologists felt that APA, and the other professional groups, had little to offer them, it is our hope that this situation no longer obtains. Other special groups in psy- chology have found that an organized effort, even by a relatively small number, can have dramatic effects on the APA governance structure, including changes in the distribution of budgeted activities; black and other minority group psychologists may note that this Conference, and many other cur- rent APA activities, have been triggered by the
"Statement of Concerns" of the Association of Black Psychologists presented to Council in Oc- tober 1968. We hope this lesson is not lost and that organizational activity within APA by black psychologists will increase.
The Conference asked that APA use its influence to assure itself of nondiscriminating practices among its service users and contractors—printers, ad- vertisers, employer listings, etc. A statement to this effect should be carried in contracts, promo- tional material, and publications.
We also recommend to the Editor that a new and regularly scheduled section of the American Psychologist be created, to report on "Psychology and Problems of Society," which might serve as a source of information to our members about signifi- cant developments in research, in Federal and state programming, and in the activity of our science as a means of promoting human welfare.
We further recommend that eventually a position be created in the Central Office under the general direction of the Executive Officer to be concerned with relating psychology to social problems includ- ing those dealt with in this report.
We urge that the Board of Directors of APA approve the spirit of these recommendations and refer them as appropriate for action to boards, committees, divisions, and state associations.

HAT are the prospects for the science Wand profession of psychology during the present decade? What are some of the influences that will affect our Association, per- haps in ways we would not choose if we were able
to plan our own course?
First of all, what will be the size of APA by
that we will fulfill Boring's prophesy for the year 2050. Indeed, I do not believe we will reach the 40,000-44,000 estimate for 1970.
Psychology's growth curve may reach an asymp- tote fairly soon and perhaps even before we reach the 30,000 figure. If we assume that 6% of psy- chologists withdraw from the field each year, we would need 1,800 annual replacements just to main-
1970? There are many ways to estimate a profes-
sion's growth. Fifteen years ago, Dael Wolfle tain a membership of 30,000. A 6°/o figure was the
(1947) estimated that the total membership of the American Psychological Association would be 16,000 by 1960 and 40,000 by 1970 if growth continued in the straight line it had followed from 1920 to 1947. Boring (see Sanford, 19S1) plotted a curve four years later that led him to predict almost 18,000 psychologists in APA by 1960, almost 44,000 by 1970, and almost 59,000,000 psychologists in 2050! Our actual membership in 1960 was 18,215.
foresee how we can expand doctoral programs be- yond the projections noted below. Unless there is a large expansion in Master's level programs during this decade, and an active effort to recruit these graduates, it seems probable that APA will stabi- lize at about 30,000 members.
I have used several methods to predict the mem-
bership of APA in 1970, but all seem open to ques-
tion. Our growth curve has been decelerating, but
a great expansion of college enrolments and gradu- will not be likely to exceed 1,200. It is hard to
ate school applications is in prospect. These anti-
thetical trends cloud the crystal ball. One method
of estimating future trends is to divide the number
of PhD degrees in psychology year by year over
the past several years into the increment in APA
membership for the same year. This gives a ratio
which should show short-range stability as extrane-
ous factors, such as the postwar degree boom, have
decreased effect. The ratios of new PhDs to APA rive at what seems a fairly accurate estimate. We
membership increments has dropped rather steadily from year to year. There is a choice of using a larger number of years and an average higher than the current ratio, or a smaller number of recent years to be sure the decreasing ratio is taken into account. Using both these methods, with United States Office of Education estimates of doctorates in the 1960s (Conger &amp; Fullam, 1959), I have ar- rived at an anticipated APA membership in 1970 between 30,000 and 33,000.
Our APA membership increased two and a half times in the decade 1950 to 1960. As our growth curve is steadily decelerating it does not seem likely
have exact figures on the total output of doctorates in the United States in all fields during the 1950s and on the output of PhDs in psychology for the same period. For these past 10 years the number of PhDs in psychology was almost exactly 6^°/o of total doctorates earned in all fields. Using the United States Office of Education estimates of the number of doctor's degrees to be awarded in the 1960s, and assuming that 6|% will continue to rep- resent the proportion in psychology, we can make yearly estimates of our output. Adding these yearly estimates we arrive at a total of 9,200 PhDs to be awarded in psychology during the current
90
best estimate of the rate of annual loss of college faculty members that could be made by the Re- search Division of the National Education Associa- tion (1961, p. 53) after a broad survey of existing information. It includes death, retirement, illness and disability, change of occupation, etc. It is hard to argue that our rate of loss will be any slower than 6% because of our higher proportion of women and our relatively higher than average tendency to leave the field for administrative and managerial positions.
The PhD output of our graduate schools by 1970
What will be the output of our graduate psy- chology programs during the 1960s? We can ar-
 decade. Now let us see what demands there will be for these people.
How many new college and university faculty members in psychology will be required in the 1960s? Ten years ago, a fair number of aca- demic disciplines were able to boast that at least half of their new college teachers had the doctoral degree. Along with psychology, more than half of all new teachers in the biological sciences and the physical sciences had received the PhD. Now psy- chology is the only academic field still above the 50% level. There has been a sharp decrease in the educational qualifications of college teachers in most fields, but especially in mathematics, English, and foreign languages.
There has been a growing demand for new faculty members in psychology. In 195S, 144 new full- time psychology teachers were employed in our colleges and universities. By 1960 this number had increased to 250. In 1961 the figure jumped to 320. In 1965, using a prediction method de- scribed below, we can estimate a need for approxi- mately 800 new faculty members in psychology and this number will continue to increase somewhat year by year thereafter.
In the first year of this decade the increase in college and university enrolments was 230,000. Each year enrolment in our higher educational in- stitutions will gain a little more than it did the year before until by 1970 the increase over 1969 will be 300,000 students. By 1970 well over 6,000,000 college students will be jammed into our colleges and universities. The 1960 enrolment was about 3,500,000.
In estimating the number of full-time faculty needed in higher educational institutions, the Re- search Division of the National Educational Asso- ciation (1961) used 6% as their estimate of the annual number of new faculty members needed to replace present faculty members who die, retire, or leave teaching. But this does not cover the in- creased enrolments.
This enrolment problem is causing uncertainty in estimates of future need for college faculty mem- bers. What is the extent to which increased en- rolments will be permitted to stretch student- faculty ratios? In estimating future needs for faculty, the Research Division of the National Edu- cation Association has arbitrarily assumed that some faculty expansion would have to occur but that we could not keep up with enrolments; per-
haps we will hold the student-faculty ratios to about a 20% increase.
Using these National Education Association esti- mates we can predict a real demand for 7,500 new college and university faculty members in psychol- ogy in the 1960s.
How many nonacademic psychologists will we need in this decade? If we continue to use 6% as the rate of attrition due to death, retirement, and other causes, and if we assume that we will find further demand in the nonacademic fields of psy- chology in proportion to the increase in the United States population, we can predict a need for 8,000 to 10,000 psychologists in nonacademic positions during the current decade.
It will be obvious that we are not going to pro- duce as many PhDs as the number of psychologists estimated as our minimum requirements. But if only half the total of new teachers and nonacade- micians are PhDs, we will come out even.
From this supply we will have to furnish addi- tional people to the growing option of private prac- tice. Nearly all of these will be new (or used) PhDs.
Let us look for a moment at the forces affecting private practice, particularly in clinical psychology. Just as public support of clinical psychology has
resulted in a marked increase in the number of clinical psychologists available, it seems safe to pre- dict that the public's growing and obvious willing- ness to support with fees psychologists in private practice will result in a sizeable increase in the number of clinical psychologists electing to enter this field.
How many psychologists are now in full-time private practice? While there is no answer to this question for the country as a whole, we have a number of sources of data which allow us to make estimates. Recently I had a student count the number of individual psychologists who list them- selves in the Yellow Pages of telephone directories in our 10 largest cities. Some 650 psychologists are so listed.
E. Lowell Kelly's (1960) recent survey of Divi- sion 12 membership found that 17% of his respond- ents reported private practice as their primary work setting. If this percentage of his sample can be extrapolated to the Division 12 membership as a whole this would mean that more than 400 mem- bers of Division 12 are engaged in relatively full- time private practice. Division 12 represents only
PSYCHOLOGY IN THE SIXTIES 91
 92 AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGIST
about one-third of the clinical psychologists who belong to APA. Continuing the extrapolation we arrive at an estimate of some 1,200 APA members (6% of the total membership) as the number in full-time private practice in clinical psychology. This is a very shaky estimate, of course, based on an extrapolation from an extrapolation. But it is the best guess we can make without much better data, and it does not differ appreciably from the 5% figure usually cited by the APA Central Office.
What are some of the factors responsible for the present and anticipated future growth in the num- ber of psychologists entering private practice? One reason, of course, is simply the fact that there are more psychologists than there used to be, and there will be more from year to year for awhile.
Other factors are also important. Our United States population is becoming more and more ur- banized and the private practice of clinical psy- chology is an urban phenomenon. Indeed profes- sional activities of all sorts are concentrated in urban areas. Psychologists turn out to be even more urbanized than physicians. In our 10 most highly urbanized states live 38% of our population, 43% of all MDs, and 55% of all APA members.
The principal reason for the growth in private practice of clinical psychology probably will be found in the acute and growing shortage of other professionals available to meet mental health de- mands of our middle and upper classes, particularly the shortage of psychiatrists. Elsewhere (Albee, 1959) I have shown in detail the fact that psy- ciatry is falling behind. Certainly our output of psychiatrists cannot be much expanded because this medical specialty is competing with other highly rewarded medical specialties for recruits from the limited pool of medical school graduates. As there is no immediate prospect of any sizable increase in the output of our medical schools and as psychi- atry will continue to recruit something less than 9% of the approximately 7,200 new medical gradu- ates each year, psychiatry cannot keep up with our growing population and with the need for replace- ment of those who leave the field.
Similar prospective shortages can be cited for other mental health fields. For example, there is a continuing manpower shortage in professional so- cial work and among clergymen of most religious denominations. All of these shortages seem des- tined to be chronic and to operate as a vacuum into
which private practitioners of clinical psychology inevitably will move.
Because the shortage of psychiatrists is likely to have such far-reaching implications for psychology we should look more closely at what is happening in psychiatry. In 1950 there were some 1,400 psy- chiatric residents in training in United States men- tal hospitals. By the end of the decade this num- ber had doubled. This sounds like a very sizeable increase. But in 1950 only 10% of the residents in psychiatric training were graduates of foreign medi- cal schools. By the end of the decade more than 40% of this group were from abroad. Two-thirds of the total of residents in our state hospitals are foreign trained. Often the attitude of the hospitals has been that it is better to have someone than no one. Recently the American Medical Association has raised serious question about this attitude with the result that qualifying examinations have now
been set up for foreign physicians to measure their competence in medical knowledge and in English. After December 31, 1960, all foreign physicians have had to be certified by the Educational Coun- cil for Foreign Medical Graduates.
Despite the sizable number of foreign physicians in residency training in this country, some 11 states in 1960 had no one in training in psychiatry. Ten additional states had fewer than 10 psychiatrists in training. In 22 of our states the public mental hos- pitals had not a solitary resident in training in psy- chiatry (American Psychiatric Association &amp; Na- tional Association for Mental Health, 1959). What do these figures mean? The number of psychia- trists available to that part of our population living in rural states, and to those hospitalized in public mental hospitals, is desperately short.
Of those psychiatrists in residency training across the country only some 800 were reported to be in their third year of training. All this simply means that we are not getting enough well-trained psy- chiatrists to meet our growing mental health de- mands. It is unfortunate, but true, that the fu- ture development of psychology is more likely to be influenced by this shortage in psychiatry than by any other single factor (save perhaps the teach- ing machine).
The increase in demand for private practitioners may affect the incomes of all psychologists. Gal- braith (1958) has pointed out that those profes- sions having the option of private sale of services are in a much better economic position than those
 in which the private practice option does not exist. Economically speaking one is much better off to be a dentist or a prostitute than a librarian or a so- cial worker! Even during periods of increased de- mand for professional services, charges for privately supplied services are likely to go up rather than down. With long-time endemic inflation a charac- teristic of our society, those professions with a siz- able proportion of their members in private prac- tice can adjust much more readily than strictly salaried professions to the increased costs of living. And even those professionals not electing the option of private practice must be better paid by agencies
in order to be held.
We have evidence that this economic law is be-
ginning to operate in psychology. Kelly's (1961) survey of Division 12 indicated that the median of male Fellows was over $14,000 a year and of female Fellows over $10,000 a year. These incomes are higher than the median income of psychologists in the National Register of Scientific and Technical Personnel (mostly PhD) reported by Levine (1961) to be about $9,000 a year.
Recently I did a mail survey of the Cleveland Psychological Association's Division of Psycholo- gists in Private Practice. I asked members of the group to report to me anonymously their gross pro- fessional income, and the proportion of their time they spent in private practice. For those respond- ing (85% of the group) median income last year was $17,500. The half-time private practice group earned $19,000, the full-time group $14,500.
The point I am making here is that all psycholo- gists, wherever employed, will tend to enjoy con- tinued improvement in their income because of the willingness of society to pay for the services of ap- plied psychologists, including those in private clini- cal practice. As this option grows, all our incomes will grow. Likewise, as sizable numbers of psy- chologists come to earn $20,000 a year, our social image, our power, our influence, and our conserva- tism will increase!
One of the difficulties with manpower estimates is that so often they merely project present trends and present ratios into the future, taking into ac- count population growth, increasing urbanization, and similar obvious factors.
Often they fail to take into account significant events which turn out to have a marked influence on future needs for professional personnel. The dis- covery of an antibiotic all but eliminated an entire
specialty area in medicine and created a whole new science. The recommendations of a Conant can go far towards eliminating the small high school, but can sharply increase the demand for counselors.
Many people predict that the publication of the final report of the Joint Commission on Mental Ill- ness and Health (1961) may prove to be such a pivot point in the whole field of mental health.
What are some of the implications of the recom- mendations contained in the Joint Commission's final report as they affect psychology and other mental health professions?
Many of the recommendations concentrate on the needs for intensified support of research, augmented treatment facilities, stepped-up care of the mentally disordered in general, and revolutionary changes in our present approach to mentally disordered per- sons. Nearly every one of these recommendations requires that we first break through the barrier of limited educational resources for professional man- power. While there are few signs that we are ready to make this effort now, it seems possible that the report will prepare the ground for a change in the social climate and we may witness a major effort to produce the professionals that do not now exist to implement the recommendations.
What are some of the specific recommendations that could affect psychology?
One recommendation concerned psychiatric units in general hospitals. The report expressed the point of view that no community general hospital of more than 100 beds is complete without a psychiatric unit. The fact is that at present only about some 600 general hospitals have any facilities for the care of mental patients beyond emergency admis- sions. This means that there are some 4,000 gen- eral hospitals in the country without such units. If we assume that a psychiatric unit in a general hospital would require the services of at least a half-time psychiatrist, a social worker, and a half- time psychologist, we begin to get some flavor of the personnel demands that would result from at- tempts to realize this particular recommendation.
Another recommendation is concerned with com- munity mental health clinics. The Joint Commis- sion recommended the modest objective of one fully staffed full-time mental health clinic to each 50,000 of our population. This certainly does not seem like an excessive goal until we consider how many professional people would be required to staff the clinics to meet this goal. Using the most conserva-

live estimate of our 1965 population it would take an additional 2,200 psychiatrists, 2,500 psycholo- gists and 5,200 psychiatric social workers to bring us up to this ratio for the whole United States. But there is one further difficulty. Because of the large number of our professional people located in highly urbanized states, and because of the pres- ent severe shortage of professional people in rural states, a much larger number of professionals would be needed to bring all of the states up to this goal than to bring up the country's average as a whole. While it is almost senseless to cite such figures, it would take nearly half of the professionalmember- ship of APA, the American Psychiatric Association, and the National Association of Social Workers to bring all of our states up to this modest goal jor mental hygiene clinics alone. (Of course, this num- ber would be increased if we decided to bring each county up to this desired ratio.)
Several other recommendations of the Joint Com- mission also would require enormous increases in personnel for realization. The needs of chronic public hospitals, children's clinics, intensive treat- ment centers, and follow-up care, all covered in the recommendations, increase manpower needs almost beyond meaning.
At the head of the list of recommendations was the proposal that a much larger proportion of funds for mental health be invested in basic research as contrasted with applied research.
If we must choose among the recommendations or assign priorities, in view of both the manpower picture and pure logic I would underline the neces- sity of making the painful decision to concentrate on training research personnel rather than treat- ment personnel. But most winds seem to be blow- ing in the other direction!
John Gordon, who was co-author of one of the Joint Commission reports, said in another context a few years ago,
No mass disease of man has ever been adequately con- trolled by attempts to treat the affected individual. Some progress can be made, there are ethical reasons for that approach, but if the objective is control of the condition in the population the fundamental approach is through defi- nition of the nature and extent of the problem, the recog- nition of causative factors, and prevention. A program based on treatment of the exaggerated illness is temporiz- ing and with no great promise of productive results; it is good clinical medicine but poor public health (Gordon, 1956).
It is obvious that simply producing more profes- sional people prepared as therapists from our gradu- ate schools and professional schools does not guar- antee the realization of the objectives outlined in the Joint Commission's report. If large numbersof our newly trained professional people go into pri- vate practice with middle-aged neurotics in high- income suburbs, doubling our output will be rela- tively meaningless.
We are torn between a humanitarian desire to do something to help present day neurotics and psy- chotics and the rational decision that only by re- search can we achieve our goal of reducing suffer- ing. Attempts to solve the problem of mental dis- order through approaches based on one-to-one, face- to-face relationships, however moral and admirable, are simply not sensible from a manpower point of view.
Sensible or not, the growth in psychology con- tinues to be in the direction of application rather than basic research.
The very rapid increase in the number of stu- dents entering graduate work in psychology has been accompanied by a concurrent change in the flavor and content of our undergraduate curriculum, thus influencing the self-selection of future gradu- ate students.
The self-selection that had led undergraduatesin the past to major in psychology, and has thereby provided the pool from which graduate students have been recruited, has occurred through the screen of a relatively difficult undergraduate curriculum. There is evidence that this situation is changing. In many ways, in many places, the undergraduate program in psychology has sacrificed rigor and diffi- culty in favor of interest and humanism.
Recently I had a graduate student tally some of the content of five introductory textbooks in wide- spread use today and contrast their content with five texts used 25 years ago. Briefly we found that present day introductory psychology textbooks have more than five times as many references to such "interesting" topics as dreams, hypnosis, neuro- sis, psychosis, and psychotherapy, as the text- books of the 1930s. Our modern texts, despite their greater length, have doubled the proportion of pages devoted to personality, conflict, mental disorder, and adjustment. Twenty-five years ago only one text in five mentioned psychoses or psychotherapy. Today, nearly all of our introductory texts go into detail on these topics.
 Because our undergraduate majors are, in large measure, self-selected as a result of exposure to be- ginning courses, it seems probable that our future recruits will be of different interest patterns and motivations because of the changing appeal in our subject matter emphasis. This change in the in- terest pattern of future psychologists will undoubt- edly be reflected in changes in graduate programs in the direction of more emphasis on methods and techniques of diagnosis and therapy and decreased emphasis on research.
The increase in interest in diagnosis and therapy will lead to a change in the emphasis of job activi- ties of psychologists with further effects on our image. A very small proportion of the Division 12 clinical psychologists surveyed by Kelly reported a primary interest in research. Only one-tenth of them were occupied primarily in research and only one-fourth of the group reported any research ac- tivities. Seventy-five percent were not doing any research! Who will argue that this situation will not affect eventually the content and emphasis of
graduate education?
Nearly 40% of the clinical psychologists Kelly
surveyed thought the next generation of psycholo- gists should be trained in a special degree program combining parts of medicine, psychology, and social work! It is doubtful that this group would agree with the recommendations of the Miami conference emphasizing the primacy of research preparation.
Finally, we are likely to witness an increase in the presently growing interest in legislation, and public relations, and in such professional matters as malpractice insurance, tax deductibility of psy- chological therapy, and strengthened professional
organization. Where will it all end! Eventually we may hear our APA Executive Officer testifying before the Congress against every piece of legisla- tion that smacks of socialized psychology! We will engage in cocktail party defenses of the in- alienable right of every citizen to choose his own psychologist without government interference.

and the confounding effects of unsuspected or uncontrolled variables that have led to premature "discoveries." He concludes that of all the new reports of toxic materials in the blood of schizophrenics "there has been no extensive substantiation of any of them" (p. 418). He continues: "Many of the cur- rent hypotheses concerning the schizophre- nia complex are original and attractive even though, up to this time, evidence directly implicating anyone of them in the disease itself is hardly compelling" (p. 426).
If there is no convincing evidence that schizophrenia is an identifiable disease, there is far less scientific support for a sickness model explanation of all of the less extreme forms of human deviation, yet the American Psychiatric Association keeps issuing posi- tion statements claiming responsibility for such conditions as mental retardation, ju- ~enile delinquency, and alcoholism. The
1rouble is that the sickness model demands ;a kind of intervention that is terribly ex- 'PCnsiveand a kind of highly trained inter- vener who is not widely available. Even- tually, I predict, the needs of society will be better served! •

Look!
With hundreds of thousands of daily drug users in the public hospitals, plus millions more seeking tranquility or at least relief from intense anxiety, the psychotropic drugs have become a fantastic growth industry. Understandably any threat to the sickness model is a threat to the drug salesmen. What is good for General Napoleon is good for United Chemical!
By using drugs for the poor in the state hospitals we can get by with practically no professional personnel in these tax-sup- ported settings. (In over one-third of our state hospitals practically no psychiatric
. time is available, and two-thirds of our 2,000 psychiatric clinics do not have a single full-time psychiatrist on the staff[ 1] ) . Eighty percent of psychiatric practice is pri- vate office practice with a suburban upper- middle class clientele.
Jules Henry (5) says: "State hospitals to- day seem to exhale from their antique bricks and dark labyrinths the miasmas of mis- understanding, prejudice, .callousness, and hate whose origins lie deep in pur history. Who knows what happens in the pit, where their voices do not come up to us?" (p. 48).
The point of all of this argument should not be lost. Psychiatry, in insisting on its prerogatives of primary patient responsibility and control of treatment institutions and intervention efforts of all sorts, bases its argument either on rare and uncertain genetic and metabolic conditions or on those common chronic organic mental conditions which it characteristically neglects. Most of psychiatric practice is private, most of it is suburban, and most hospital psychiatry is practiced in general hospitals. None of the organic mental conditions is the central con- cern of current psychiatric treatment.
A great majority of the people whom psy- chiatrists treat are not suffering from genetic, metabolic, and arteriosclerotic conditions, or from alcoholic delirium, or from central ner- vous system malfunction. If psychiatrists were to devote their primary attention to these kinds of cases there would be little need for today's debate about models. Repeatedly,

arguing for its replacement with a social- developmental model. Certainly the most fundamental contribution of Freud was his discovery of the continuity between the nor- mal and the abnormal. In discussing Dar- win and Freud, Jerome Bruner pointed out that the Victorians, reeling from Darwin's discovery of a perfectly lawful continuity be- tween man and the rest of the animal king- dom, were dealt a second and more terrifying blow by Freud's discovery of the continuity between the sane and the insane. Bruner( 3 ) speaks of the
state hospitals and public clinics would be replaced by social intervention centers, largely staffed by people at the bachelor's level-more like special education teachers and social welfare workers, potentially avail- able in vastly greater supply than psychol- ogists and psychiatrists. For prevention, peo- ple like ourselves would be needed as teachers, researchers, and especially as rad- ical social activists proselytizing for changes in our society to make it more supportive, less dehumanized.
The massive deterioration of the fabric of soc[ety and its institutions results in a com-
. . . lawful continuity between man and the
animal kihgdom, between dreams and unrea- plex tangle of pathology. The pathology
son on one side and waking rationality on the other, between madness and sanity, between consciousness and unconsciousness; between the mind of the child and the adult mind, be-
includes especially the destruction of the emotional integrity of the family. Let me emphasize here something that you already know very well. Many significant research breakthroughs have already been made. Many of the discoveries are already in. We know, for example, that the emoti6nal cli- mate which surrounds the infant and young child is of critical importance in determining his future-including the kind, the severity, and perhaps even the biological concomi- tants of his later disturbance.
Such knowledge is dangerous. We usually shut our eyes to its implications. We go on trying to fix up damaged adults in one-to- one relationships when a more proper pro- fessional function would be to spend a con- siderable portion of our energies trying to fix up our society in ways that will increase the strength and stability of the family, there- by affecting positively the mental health of generations to come. It is not possible here to further elaborate upon prevention except to say that I believe, because of the nature of the human animal, it must take the form of strengthening the institution of the family.
I believe that history may judge President Johnson to have been one of the most com- plicated of American presidents. But his speech at Howard University's commence- ment will be judged among the half-dozen great landmarks in the history of our society. In it the President called for a massive attack on the central problem of our time. He said:

these has been a cherished discontinuity pre- served in doctrinal canons.
Freud forced the abandonment of thes~ cherished discontinuities.
Why, in the face of this central message of Freud's life work, does the latter-day psy- choanalyst continue to pay homage to the sickness model? Primarily, I think, because of the historical accident which has re- quired the psychoanalyst in the United States to be trained first as a physician. I look for- ward to the day when the psychoanalysts, perhaps in continuing self-analysis, will join forces with Freud and the rest of us who be- lieve the evidence supports a continuity mod- el, a model which holds that it is established that the same mechanisms are operating in adaptive and maladaptive human behavior, and will help lead the scientific assault on those who seek to preserve and defend the sickness model.

            <Text> CONCEPTUAL MODELS AND MANPOWER REQUIREMENTS IN PSYCHOLOGY
GEORGE W. ALBEE
Case Western Reserve University
IT is increasingly clear that the current and the prospective professional manpower shortages in the mental health field derive primarily from a set of interacting considerations that go somewhat as follows:
Disturbed and disturbing human behavior cur- rently is "explained" by a conceptual model which attributes causation to "disease" or to some form of "illness." The content of the explanatory model accounting for these sorts of human deviation dic- tates the specific kind of institutional structure which society must support for the delivery of care or intervention. And the nature of the institu- tion in turn dictates the kind of manpower required for its staffing. So we are confronted with a desperate shortage of medical and paramedical pro- fessionals required to staff hospitals, clinics, and centers. This shortage is going to worsen in the
years ahead as the institutional demands proliferate while the manpower supply does not.
Because of the primacy of the disease explanation for disturbed behavior, the largest share of available funds for training and for research is funneled into biomedical programs. These training programs are producing professionals who, after being trained at public expense, do not work primarily with these serious, chronically disturbed people who are the responsibility of tax-supported institutions (Arn- hoff &amp; Shriver, 1967). And, further, the biomedi- cally oriented research programs demanded by the disease model support complex laboratory research studies that have little relevance to the real etio- logical problems of disturbed people.
There is a current, popular platitude which says that the social and behavioral sciences seriously lag the physical and biological sciences in knowl- edge. If only, it is opined, we could make faster progress in behavioral science, if only we could learn as much about the human being as we know already about germs and atoms, then more effec- tive programs could be developed to deal with man's problems with himself and with his fellows.
This reading of the knowledge situation is far from accurate. We do know a great deal in the behavioral sciences, but many of the things we know are threatening to the mental health Establishment and therefore to the status quo. For example, we know very well that the nature of the social world of the infant and child in the family are of primary importance as determinants of subsequent rates of disturbed behavior. Tn our Western culture the stable family is the best bulwark against later be- havioral and emotional disturbance. Efforts at pre- vention of mental disorder should be directed to those social institutions that affect family stability directly or indirectly, positively or negatively. For hopelessly disrupted families we should seek new ways of providing the best possible alterna- tives for the children affected—whether in foster
homes or specially designed institutions like kibbut- zim.
When eventually alternative explanatory models for disturbed behavior are widely tolerated, and institutions based on them supported with public funds are available, there will still be real mental illness to keep busy the organically oriented psy- chiatrist. All of the emotional problems associated with serious central nervous system malfunctioning, seizure states, toxic and endocrinologically induced psychoses, and the problems of organically induced behavioral disturbances in general will be left. But of course these are not the conditions that in- terest contemporary psychiatry, perhaps in part because there is so little token reinforcement with these kinds of cases! Psychotherapy is the pri- mary professional activity in psychiatry, and mild neurotics are the preferred cases.
The mental health establishment has made so many promises to so many groups in our society that it is beyond the wildest manpower dream thai it can begin to supply these services (Albee, 1967). Let me just mention some of these new demands without elaborating them.
The labor unions, particularly the United Auto
 318
AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGIST
Workers, have negotiated contracts for outpatient psychiatric care for their members and families— more than two and a half million UAW people sud- denly have become eligible for outpatient mental health care. Other unions actively are establishing their own mental health clinics. Once one union docs these things other unions must begin to do them too, and all of these new plans require scarce professional manpower.
Perhaps the single most important recent legisla- tive act in this whole field, so far as manpower de- mand is concerned, was Medicare. Without going through all of the different components of Medi- care, it can be said for sure that an enormous new group of users of mental health services suddenly is eligible for prepaid or insured care. One of the most important parts of Medicare is Title 19, under which anyone defined as "medically indigent," along with their children, is eligible for outpatient psy- chiatric care and other mental health services. There will be very large new demands for profes- sional mental health care under this law.
Nor need we dwell long on the 2,000 new com- prehensive mental health centers that the National Institute of Mental Health promises will be built by 1980 with Federal, state, and local funds. The demand for professional medical and paramedical care in these centers is beyond all hope of realiza- tion. How can the 2,000 centers be staffed when two-thirds of our existing 2,000 psychiatric clinics are without a single full-time psychiatrist, and when little psychiatric care is available in at least one- third of our state hospitals (National Committee against Mental Illness, 1966)?
There is no point in discussing the Appalachian program, although it contains more extensive blue- prints for programs in mental health than the whole Comprehensive Community Mental Health Centers Act!
Nor need there be further elaboration on current manpower shortages in all the other professions represented in the 2,000 existing "psychiatric" clinics, the VA hospitals, the state hospitals, in higher education, etc. The point I hope to leave with you in this recitation of the growing demand for mental health services is this: All of the plans for increasing professional services for the aged, for the union members and their families, for the medically indigent, for the inner-city poor, and for all the others lining up for care—all of these pro- grams arc going to fail because we do not have
enough of the kind of manpower demanded by the disease model of mental disorder.
It is so simple. The explanatory model dictates the kind of professional manpower needed to staff the institutions. This means a current and future need for nonexistent medical and paramedical pro- fessionals. Since 1958, when the Bane report was made to the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare (Bane, 1959), it has been the consensus of all manpower experts that we should be producing at least 11,000 physicians a year in this country, if we are only to stay even in the ratio of physicians to population! But we are not training this num- ber. Currently we are training only 7,500 annually —so, year after year, we fall at least 3,500 new MDs farther behind the number that would be required just to keep our ratio of physicians to population constant. The only possible conclusion is that physicians, and, as a consequence, psychi- atrists, are going to be in even shorter supply, while all of these service demands I sketched a moment ago are mushrooming everywhere.
Elsewhere I have argued that the future avail- able supply of clinical psychologists and social workers is at least as inadequate as the prospective supply in psychiatry (Albee, 1967). The demands for academicians in psychology, for example, can absorb most of the PhDs we produce over the next decade or two. Because psychology is a relatively young profession there has not been a large re- placement demand for faculty members in this field. In other academic fields this replacement figure approaches 6% a year. As psychology pro- fessors continue to age we will need to hire replace- ments in addition to those needed for the expand- ing student enrollments.
Any manpower planning for mental health care as now conceived must confront explicitly these prospective chronic shortages of professionals. If we continue to use the illness model of mental dis- order, we cannot produce a fraction of the medical and paramedical people the model demands. This would not be a sufficient reason for abandoning the illness model, if it were supported firmly by research evidence. But the evidence supporting it is thin indeed. What I am suggesting is that we are in a manpower cul-de-sac because of the con- ceptual model we use. The development of alterna- tive models could lead to new manpower solutions because they would allow for new institutional solu-
 CONCEPTUAL MODELS AND MANPOWER REQUIREMENTS 319
tions requiring manpower more easily recruited and trained.
Eventually the demands of society will prevail. The times are ripe for new models, for new ideas. We cannot push along this social change unless we develop a new set of concepts, a new conceptual armamentarium, a new language, a new delivery system for service.
This reconceptualization must follow rejection by psychology of the illness model. But it is not simply a matter of blowing a trumpet and seeing the walls collapse! The illness model is sup- ported by powerful forces. There are many rea- sons for its persistence in the field of functional behavior disorder (Albee, 1967).
The model was developed, and it has persisted, because it was more convincing than the sin, taint, or demonic explanations. Also, the early success in finding the spirochete to be the cause of paresis led to hopes that other mental "illnesses" also had similar causes. Further, it seemed more and more as though genetic factors were important. The illness explanation also supported the practice of putting victims out of sight in plague houses until "a cure" was found. Money could be spent on chemical and biological research, without upsetting the value hierarchy in the society. Finally, both family and society could avoid personal responsi- bility for mental disorder. They could blame Fate.
Perhaps, however, the most compelling reason of all for the persistence of this model has been the absence of any alternative model. A scientific model will persist until a more valid and more convincing model appears.
Over the past 20 years there have begun to emerge out of psychotherapy, experimental work in the learning laboratory, cultural anthropology, and social work, to name just a few sources, elements of an explanatory model for disturbed behavior which might be called the social learning theory. This theory argues that most disturbed behavior con- sists of learned operant anxiety-avoiding responses. The origins of the anxiety to be avoided are to be found in traumatic social interaction of infants and children with the parents or parent surrogates. Evidence to support this explanatory model is ac- cumulating in the research literature.
I suggest that as psychologists we have played the illness game for 20 years and this is long enough. The rules of the illness game are such that there will never be enough professional people avail-
able to provide care except to selected members of the middle and upper classes. As long as the ill- ness model occupies the center of the stage, all of the planning, all of the action is going to deal with psychiatric treatment, mental hospital beds, and the Team. Psychology must create its own in- stitutional structure for developing methods for the delivery of service, because only in its own struc- ture can it begin to elaborate this new conceptual model—the dimensions of which I have sketched so briefly—together with the language and the in- tervention methods that eventually will permit peo- ple with a bachelor's degree (or even less educa- tion) to be the line workers in the field of behavioral disorders.
Let me emphasize that I do not see psychology as the care-delivery field. We can never have the manpower to meet the demands. Rather, we must create the theory and show how it is ap- plicable, to enable care to be given by bachelor's level people in habilitation centers that they them- selves administer. Psychology can only be the developer of the conceptual models and of the research underpinning. The parallel with the field of education is evident. Intervention in the educa- tional system is by bachelor's level teachers who are supported by more highly trained research workers from several fields. Only when institutions are built in which BA people can work with dis- turbed or retarded children and adults (perhaps Project Re-ed is the best example of what ] have in mind) will we begin to meet the demand.
Frankly, I find it astonishing that all of us as parents, and as citizens, are willing to send our children to the daily ministrations of school teach- ers trained essentially at the bachelor's level, and yet we insist that professionals dealing with our emotionally disturbed and mentally retarded chil- dren and adults must have far more training than teachers for their face-to-face intervention.
Let us start developing an institutional structure where the rules and language are based on research findings in behavior modification. Let us develop centers where technicians, nonprofessionals, re- habilitation workers of all kinds can be used to maximize human potential. Until we have a con- ceptual assessment system that uses indications of strength we will still be playing the illness game. The new model which I think we must develop will stress the maximization of human effectiveness. I have argued that this model will not be built until
 320 AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGIST
psychology develops it in its own service delivery setting from which we can also go out into those community agencies where the real problems are.
Once society accepts the position that most, if not all, functionally disturbed behavior represents learned patterns of anxiety avoidance, the institu- tions developed to deal with these conditions may well be educational in nature.
Albert Bandura (1967) has said it well:
The day may not be far off when psychological disorders will be treated not in hospitals or mental hygiene clinics but in comprehensive "learning centers," when clients will be considered not patients suffering from hidden psychic pathologies but responsible people who participate actively in developing their own potentialities [p. 861.
Unless psychology assumes leadership in develop- ing alternatives to the illness model, the mental health manpower picture is going to continue to get worse. We cannot train enough medical and paramedical professionals to meet the manpower needs of hospitals and clinics, but, more important,
we cannot use knowledge already available to deal with the pressing problems of our urbanized, au- tomated antihuman existence.

LJNTCAL psychology has entered a paradox- Cical phase in its development where its prob- lems of identity and relevance threaten it with extinction at the same time that its oppor- tunities seem boundless. The demand for clinical psychologists far exceeds the number available or
being trained. While able undergraduates in greater numbers than ever before are knocking on the doors of our graduate schools seeking admission to clinical training programs, these schools are ac- cepting fewer clinical students. Indeed, clinical programs are being dropped or sharply curtailed by many prestigious universities.
Professional psychologists are increasingly critical of existing graduate programs, charging that the curriculum is irrelevant and inappropriate and that deliberate efforts are being made to dry up the supply of future clinicians.
What are some of the forces responsible for this strange state of affairs, where everyone seems eager to expand training in clinical psychology except the field of psychology itself, particularly those fields of scientific psychology that control the graduate programs?
Let me suggest that the basic incompatibilities between the field of clinical psychology and the parent discipline have reached the point where only drastic changes may be effective in preserving the profession.
Our problems in clinical psychology are based in part on the location of our training, because this creates our ideology, our self-image, and our goals, and in part on the fundamental incompatibility of the roles of scientist and professional within one individual. Let me examine these two basic prob- lems in some detail.
Some years ago, Roger Barker suggested that a good way to predict the behavior of a human being

is to find out where he is. While I do not wish to take a position that suggests total control of behav- ior by the immediate environment, I would agree that a person does behave differently in a research lab, at a football game, in a cocktail lounge, and in an APA Council meeting. ] would also argue that for 25 years clinical psychologists have be- haved in ways responsive to the location of their training, partly in academic departments and partly in psychiatric settings. In both settings, they have
been treated as second-class citizens.
Clinical psychology is making the painful dis-
covery that academic departments of psychology in the faculty of arts and sciences are not the best places in which to train professionals and that the psychiatric setting is an unsatisfactory place to learn the ideology of practice. But it is hard to change tradition, even if tradition is only 25 years

old. Warren Bennis has observed that changing a university is about as easy as reorganizing a ceme- tery! There will be many serious obstacles to changes in the pattern of training of professional psychology. Let me direct your attention to some of these obstacles.
For one thing, clinical psychology differs in its origins from practically every other major profes- sion. Other professions began as loose organiza- tions of people delivering services needed by soci- ety, or segments of society, and the service was delivered in the marketplace. One received one's training by apprenticeship. If you wanted to be a social worker, you went to work in a settlement house or social welfare agency. Aspiring physicians were apprenticed to a practicing doctor. It was possible to "read law" in a lawyer's office. Gradu- ally, following a sociological law which says that aspiring professionals must learn theory and knowl- edge based on research before learning skills, pro-
fessional training moved onto the university campus. There it took root with separate professional facul- ties, separate professional degrees, and, for the most part, separate captive practicum training facilities where students could be apprentices of senior pro- fessionals. So, we find that all professional schools teach theory during the early part of their programs, but insure that their fledgling professionals receive extensive apprenticeship training in captive service facilities with successful practitioner role-models who often donate their time to the professional school in exchange for prerogatives such as bed privileges, honorific titles, or free office space and secretarial help.
Clinical psychology has a very different history. I will not tire you with its recitation because it is so familiar. Let me simply remind you that clinical psychology began as a small offshoot of academic, scientific psychology, growing within the confines of the graduate school where professional educa- tion was unfamiliar. In addition, I have been pointing out for several years that clinical psychol- ogy has owned no captive practicum training facil- ity of its own, and so, like the cuckoo, it has had to place its eggs in other birds' nests. In 1946, graduate departments of psychology accepted the invitation of the Veterans Administration to send clinical students for paid internships in their psy- chiatric settings. Experience in psychiatric settings quickly became mandatory—with the result that we became members of a Team in a game where we
had little influence on the rules and no choice of ballpark. Back home in the graduate department, faculty members teaching clinical courses were often nonscientific, or young, or adjunct, but in most cases low status. The clinical students had the worst of both worlds. Some adapted, some tried to outscience the scientists, and many identified with the aggressor and adopted the values and language of psychiatry. Clinical psychology does not control its own faculty appointments and pro- motions; instead, recommendations from the de- partment are made to a faculty supercommittee that consists of nonpsychologists including profes- sors from the sciences, arts, and humanities, most of whom are completely uninformed about the spe- cial needs and requirementsof a professional train- ing program. The present PhD programs in clin- ical psychology must depend for support on budgets controlled by academic vice-presidents, graduate school deans, and department chairmen, most of whom are either unsympathetic toward, or ignorant of, both the financial requirements of professional training, the need for professional staff qualified to teach skills, and the need for our own service- delivery programs for practicum training.
The establishment of separate programs for clinical psychology would be enormously expensive. Federal funding (NIMH) is the most likely source, and it is not a very promising one, not only because of sharply reduced funding in prospect, but also because historically the N I M H has served the psychiatric establishment. In view of its elimina- tion of psychology as a separate branch, together with many indicators in recent years that the powers at NIMH are engaged in decision making that reduces support of psychology training, I see no reason for optimism that very many separate schools of clinical psychology will flourish with NIMH nurturance.
The academic department is the wrong place to teach professional psychology, and the psychiatric setting is the wrong place for apprenticeship train- ing. In psychiatric settings, the clinical psycholo- gist in training learns to speak the language of psychiatry, learns to use and accept the sickness model, and often aspires to a career in the private practice of psychotherapy.
In adopting the sickness explanation from psychi- atry, the psychologist, perhaps unwittingly, sup- ports those cultural forces of reaction that delay the social changes essential to the prevention of
 emotional distress, and that bar intervention by modestly trained therapists. If mentally disturbed individuals are suffering from some unknown and undiscovered illness rather than damaged by a hostile and evil social environment, then the strat- egy for action calls for discovery of the cause of the disease rather than social action to change the dehumanizing forces of society.
Perhaps the most serious consequence for clin- ical psychology deriving from its near-total im- mersion in the psychiatric setting is that clinical psychologists and their students have been exposed to a very narrow range of human problems and, without any real opportunity to think about the matter, have accepted the psychiatric definition, confused as it is, of who is to receive our interven- tion. As a result, our selected treatment population is largely restricted to the two groups traditionally served in psychiatric settings. The first of these groups, usually found in the general hospital, espe- cially the university hospital, is the white middle- class neurotic who seeks prolonged psychothera- peutic relationships—people whom Schofield has described as having the Y A VIS syndrome (young, attractive, verbal, intelligent, and successful). The second group clinical psychology has learned to work with is the seriously disturbed poor who are incarcerated in tax-supported state and Veterans Administration hospitals. These groups are so familiar to us, and we have been brainwashed so long into believing that they represent most of the universe of emotionally disturbed people, that our textbooks, our courses, our case-seminars, our p e r - sonality theories, and our field work placements for students draw on experience with these groups. If, 25 years ago, enormously increased amounts of federal support for training in psychological inter- vention had been funneled through the public school system, rather than through psychiatric facilities, the present nature of clinical psychology would have been altogether different. Or, if psychological manpower had been supported and trained through the welfare system, we would be a still different field today.
What I am suggesting to you is that we try now standing back at as great a distance and with as much perspective as we can manage, to see what are the truly most pressing psychological problems that afflict our society, and whether clinical psy- chology, or some new field of applied psychology like community psychology, might not select these
more urgent human emotional problems as our focus after breaking free of psychiatric influence on our choice. Must we work on problems and programs only because financial support for them is available, or can we assume some responsibility for developing public awareness and then public support for intervention with the real problems of our society?
Let me suggest to you, as one example, that racism is a far more serious, pathological, and deep-seated emotional problem in our society than either the sexual neuroses of latter-day Victorians or the existential neuroses of the affluent. Racists do share some of the pathological symptoms we encounter in the clinic. The racist is delusional. He believes things to be true that are not true because such beliefs serve deep unconscious emo- tional needs, and his belief is unshakable by reason or logic. How much individual case-study have clinical psychologists done with the individual racist, and where have we studied the epidemiology of racism? Unless our society solves the problems of racism, we are not going to survive as a nation. Does this mental condition not merit our attention? Have we tried to do anything in the way of mean- ingful intervention with the racists? The mental health field has been enchanted in recent years with the development of store-front intervention centers in the slums where local indigenous workers, know- ing the language and culture, have been effective in working with the people of these depressed neighborhoods. But why has clinical psychology not opened its own store-front intervention centers in suburbia, staffed by psychologists who speak the language and understand the white suburban affluent culture, to intervene with the local inhabi- tants afflicted with racism and other virulent forms of prejudice? Why are we so much less threatened by the neuroses of sex than we are by the neuroses of hate? Perhaps, because psychiatry has had little interest in the pathology of aggression, neither have we.
Similarly, clinical psychology has paid almost no attention to the damaging emotional consequences of discrimination based on sex, and yet sexism, like racism, is almost entirely a psychological process, especially a learning process. Schizophrenia is one of the three major subjects each year in Psycho- logical Abstracts reflecting the time, energy, and resources we invest in studying this condition. T am suggesting there are other, more immediate and

pressing social problems that we should turn our attention to, problems not usually defined as "psychiatric" but which are surely psychological.
We have taught our students for years that mental cases include those people who are "danger- ous to themselves or others." But we have chosen to intervene with a very restricted range of those who are dangerous to others. Who is move danger- ous to his fellow human beings than the sophisti- cated racist? Racist attitudes and behavior, which can be found in a great many places throughout our social and economic institutions, including our state and federal governments, are far more dangerous to others than schizophrenia.
I would suggest as a further example that certain economic philosophies that are prevalent in our society are also exceptionally dangerous to others. An economic philosophy that justifies the maximiza- tion of profit at the expense of the safety, health, and happiness of the citizen should be as much a concern of the mental health worker, particularly the clinical and community psychologist, as more traditional forms of neurosis. In the last few years, I have been driven to conclude that an affluent white Protestant elite, which controls most of our major corporations and our banking system, and indirectly much of our government at all levels, engages in a mammoth, self-seeking, power- and profit-motivated enterprise which results in in- equitable distribution of jobs, resources, and health care, and affects even such fundamentals as life expectancy. The most visible victims are the urban black people, but T would hasten to point out that there arc millions of poverty-stricken whites in Appalachia and elsewhere who, together with the American Indians and the Mexican-Americans, arc
also victimized by the economic system. Women are also victimized and exploited by our system. If professional psychologists were truly concerned with human welfare, we could forget "psychiatric patients" for a century and turn our attention to the psychological causes of racism, sexism, and of the profit motive as sources of danger to the human- centered life.
I am not so quixotic as to believe that clinic;il psychology can have any immediate dramatic effect on these systems. But if we are not concerned with human contributions to human suffering, who else should be working on these problems?
The assassination of John Kennedy may have been a major mark on the bench of history. It is
possible that Kennedy's death marked the demise of liberal optimism for a century. The liberal expectation of the gradual triumph of human sanity and reason has had to yield to the fearful fact that good and humanistic forces may not ultimately overcome. While people in many parts of the world have believed for a long time that injustice and human exploitation are the inexorable laws of life, there has been cause for optimism in our democratic society that man might indeed be his brother's keeper. The death of the young hero sharpened our perceptions so that we are now more receptive to the naked reality of human exploita- tion and psychopathic manipulation of people by people. Harold Lasswell (1970) said at our Con- vention last year:
If the earlier promise was that knowledge would make men free, the contemporary reality seems to be that more men are manipulated without their consent for more purposes by more techniques by fewer men than at any time in history [p. 119].
Surely, the cynical manipulation of the masses by powerful elites is a subject worthy of psychological investigation. Which groups arc most "dangerous to others"? Our society locks up overt paranoids. But it pays honor and respect to the industrialist who builds automobiles that are death traps, who sprays our fruit with coal tar poisons, and who shows utter disregard for public good in a simple- minded search for profits and power. Why have clinical psychologists not been concerned with the motivations of the manipulators? When the Con- gress refuses to include farm workers under mini- mum wage and health-legislation, it dooms hundreds of thousands of children and adults to lives of hopeless poverty and disease. When giant chemical companies dump deadly poisons into our streams and lakes, psychology should be involved in apply- ing its knowledge to prevention of such destruction.
In brief, the relevance of both our curriculum and of our internship experience must be questioned if we are not to have our roles defined for us by the values and goals of psychiatry and of the prevailing economic philosophy.
But there is another serious problem as well. The truly crippling sources of cognitive dissonance in the professional psychologist, which may ulti- mately destroy the unity of psychology, are the fundamental differences between the scientist and the professional. A primary one involves self-
 criticism and mutual criticism. Science is open, and its knowledge is public. Any discrepancies in knowledge are debated openly. One of the hall- marks of science is its insistence on public dis- closure of findings. Graduate students in science are taught that research is not completed until the findings are made public. A freewheeling spirit of incisive mutual and self-criticism, replication, debate, and argument over procedures, findings, and interpretation of data, is ever-present. In sharp contrast, a profession must jealously guard its secrets! Historically, one of the hallmarks of a profession has been the privacy of its knowledge. Tf the knowledge of the professional, his techniques, and his skills are available to anyone, and could be performed by anyone, a profession would dis-
integrate. Secrecy and mystery are essential. Even a special technical language is a universal characteristic of the profession. Why were pre- scriptions written in Latin? Why does a profession develop its own jargon, its own secret language? Why are professions protected by strict licensing laws that actually proscribe certain of their activities to anyone but the qualified professional?
The first professionals, according to Veblen, were the priests who thousands of years ago guarded the Egyptian temples at night and took the opportunity to observe the transit of the stars in the heavens. They discovered that the flood of the Nile co- incided with the juxtaposition of certain stars. Im- mediately, they had powerful knowledge of great value to their society, and, like professionals ever since, they kept their knowledge secret, thus pre- serving the prestige of their profession, their credi- bility, and their godlike qualities. While profes-
sions exist to serve society, they must protect what they know, and they must always pretend to know more than they do in order to retain public confi- dence. In contrast, science abhors secrecy and does not tolerate faking or pretense.
One of the most serious problems for the scientist-professional psychologist (Boulder model) has been the requirement that he play the incom- patible game of science, and so subject his tech- niques, his theories, and his methods to open public, critical, scientific scrutiny. If other pro- fessions had to engage in the kind of self-criticism and mutual criticism that clinical psychologists are required to perform, they would be experiencing the same agony as we. Imagine the chaos if public
and open debate and criticism were the rule in medical office diagnosis, drug therapies, surgery, etc. Let me illustrate my point with one example-—• what could have been clinical psychology's most mysterious and powerful magic—the Rorschach. Here was a procedure that fulfilled most of the criteria establishing the power of an independent profession. The Rorschach belonged to psychol- ogy. It had enormous face validity and credibility, and it required long and arduous supervised train- ing before one could be expert in its mysteries and its mystique. Its powers were so great that all sorts of controls had to be placed around the preparation of those who would be using it. Twenty years ago, most of us believed in the art of the Rorschach. The public was fascinated by
the magic we owned. Other professions viewed our magic with respect. But along came the hard- nosed scientists, the measurement people, with their questions about reliability and validity, with their split-half techniques, and their demand for public demonstration of the value of our magic under strictly controlled conditions. As a consequence, the Rorschach is quietly disappearing from the professional psychology scene because of our pro- fessional sensitivity to the claims of science. Inter- estingly, the public still believes in the Rorschach. Similarly, the process of psychotherapy—a mysteri- ous alchemy of great power and public interest—has
been subjected to controlled studies, to long-term follow-up, to objective evaluation procedures, to the point where it has lost considerable credibility within psychology, although professional ingenuity in inventing new forms of psychotherapy has at least kept pace with the efforts of evaluators to catch up and expose it!
Another related source of conflict: The research methods available to clinical psychology are not as pure and powerful as those in experimental psy- chology. Inasmuch as the heroes of any profession are the scientists who supply it with its soundest, most valid knowledge, the weaker research methods of the clinician subject him to criticisms that only add to his inferiority feelings. Anthropologists tell us that there are still societies that are unaware of the relationship between sexual intercourse and pregnancy. Many of the relationships important to the clinical psychologist are of this sort, par- ticularly the relationship between childhood experi-
ences and adult behavioral disturbances. The

farther causes and effects are separated in time, or the more occasions where a possible cause is not followed by the possible effect, the more difficult is the relationship to unravel through research. The hundreds of years that elapsed before the discovery of the relationship between syphilis in early adult- hood and the development of general paralysis of the insane in middle age was due in part to the long separation in time between cause and effect. Further, many persons with syphilis apparently re- covered from their disease and never developed general paralysis. Also, many persons developed paralyses without developing the mental symptoms of paresis. It was so confusing! One widely held explanation of general paralysis linked it to frequent minor trauma to the central nervous system because it was so common in traveling salesmen who had to ride the hard seats of railway cars for thousands of miles each year, while the condition was remark- ably absent in clergymen who ordinarily stayed close to home and were not subject to such spine- jarring experiences!
Some of our current clinical hypotheses may sound as ludicrous in another hundred years. But T would argue that the truly significant relation- ships explaining most psychological disorders will still be discovered to be those between early trau- matic conditioning and subsequent adult instru- mental acts to avoid the effects of such early painful conditioning. Harry Harlow has given us a clear-cut paradigm from the animal laboratory, and Bruno Bettelheim has provided a rough clin- ical example with schizophrenic children. Much research in this area does not have the methodo- logical purity to satisfy the experimentalists. While both the scientists and the professionals are con- cerned with discovering regularities in nature, the scientist, particularly the experimentalist, can choose more powerful methods of demonstrating such regularities. Experiments that impose strict control on the operation of independent variables often lead quickly to the identification of signifi- cant relationships. The discovery of regularities in nature is accelerated in psychological labs where pure strains of laboratory animals are available, destruction of cortical tissue can be accomplished, and extreme conditions of stress, sensory depriva-
tion, infantile trauma, and similar drastic manipula- tions are scientifically acceptable and practical.
On the other hand, the professional, dealing with human lives, is thus restrained by humane and
ethical considerations that frequently prohibit such manipulation of experimental variables. The cli- nician, including the clinical psychologist, often must engage in life-history research rather than experimentation. Any student of research design knows the pitfalls and complexities of such meth- ods, particularly when causes and effects are sepa- rated by long periods of time. The discovery of significant relationships is difficult and uncertain. As a result, clinical psychologists are often the recipients of scornful criticism from experimental psychologists because of the flabbiness of their concepts, the looseness of their hypotheses, and the unreliability of their procedures. In a field that accords its highest status to its scientists, the pro- fessionals are again second-class and disadvantaged.
There are those scientists who would, if they could, impose a moratorium on professional activi- ties in psychology "until we know more about the causes of deviant behavior." Even in clinical re- search, the more "rigorous" approach (Spence's Type IV laws seeking relationships between organic substrata and behavior) has higher status than the investigation of Type II laws (relating early experi- ence and behavior), because the experimental or empirical operations are neater, more direct, and more acceptable.
Additional sources of friction and polarization emerging within psychology today involve questions about the appropriateness of lobbying and social action. Some of this activity is meant to improve the economic position of the clinician, as in the case of health insurance coverage. Other efforts are proposed to influence the public, through APA pronouncements, on a range of issues varying from abortion laws and sexism to Vietnam and popula- tion control. In general, most scientists in APA take the position that they should engage in politi- cal activities as citizens but rarely in the name of psychology. Professionals, on the other hand, have a long history of expressing opinions on issues having direct or indirect consequences for the pro- fession, often in the absence of thoroughgoing knowledge and consensus. Professionals are pre- pared to testify, to speak out, to pass resolutions, on matters that they regard as destructive to the human condition, or not in their own or the public interest. Professionals do indeed act more godlike, echoing another difference between science and pro- fession. The scientist wants to examine all of the evidence before he takes a stand in a controversy.
 away from committing himself prematurely. The professional, in contrast, is accustomed to making decisions on the basis of incomplete or even scanty evidence—he may be accustomed also to making judgments in life-and-death matters where he has only small odds that he is right. He acts in the best interests, he hopes, of the human condition in the absence of scientific certainty.
Among other professions, for example, social work has passed resolutions on a wide range of social, national, and international problems, and the American Medical Association has relinquished its tax-exempt status in order to participate actively in attempts at influencing legislation—in opposing programs like social security, medicare, health insurance, etc. The National Education Associa- tion lobbies actively for teachers' benefits. The sciences, on the other hand, are less inclined to speak out on social issues except where science itself is directly threatened. What is chemistry's position on abortion? What does mathematics have to say about pollution of the environment?
The Board of Directors further considered this matter at its midsummer meeting in 1969 in Boston and adopted a statement which said, among other things, that APA could take no official stand affirming or denying the validity of any scientific hypothesis.
The cumulative weight of these positions makes APA's response to social issues relatively limited and further polarizes the professionals. Thus, for example, the Association might work energetically to obtain an increase in training and research funds for psychology from federal agencies, or it might take an active role in arguing against the restriction of the use of psychological tests and research. It might prepare a position paper on the comprehen- sive community health centers program. But it would not take a stand on the conclusions of the Kerner Report, nor on the war in Southeast Asia. While it is likely that a majority of psychologists personally agree with the conclusions of the Kerner Report, and would oppose the war, these are not matters of particular and special relevance to the field of psychology in its scientific functions. Many

He is willing to permit any and all hypotheses a professional matters, and a limited range of ap- hearing, and he is used to postponing decisions on propriate activities in the general area of social their validity until more evidence is in. He shies problems.
The social sciences are less inhibited in these areas
than the natural sciences. The national social professionals feel otherwise and mutter about the
science societies most closely involved in the study of human behavior and social phenomena have had experience with disruptive tactics from their stu- dents and younger members who are impatient with the conservatism of the "Establishment." The anthropologists, sociologists, political scientists, and psychologists have had their meetings disrupted for two or three years. So have the social workers and psychiatrists. Such confrontation has led to posi- tion papers and resolutions on social issues. But there has been less of this sort of activism among the harder sciences.
Psychology has had to agonize for several years over policy questions involving public affairs. Should American psychology speak out on the war, on racism? The ad hoc Committee on Public Affairs, chaired by Leona Tyler (1969), wrestled with these issues and concluded that the Board of Directors should assume full responsibility in the area of public affairs. The Tyler Committee de- veloped some guidelines for decisions about ap- propriate action. Briefly, it suggested a wide range of possible association action for scientific matters, a somewhat restricted range of possible actions for
Establishment in psychology and seek to politicize APA, change its governance structure and its tax status.
The activist also may point to the statement in the Tyler Report (1969) which suggests that mobilization of APA to obtain governmental policy changes "would be made only rarely, in cases where the legislation or policy threatened the continued existence or progress of psychology as a field of knowledge [p. 3]." Is there not evidence, asks the activist, that war, racism, and population growth may indeed threaten the continuing exis- tence of our American society? Serious observers, such as John Gardner, warn that the nation is in real danger of disintegration. If the nation deterio- rates, psychology will be among the first whose existence is threatened. Tyrants and totalitarians are not normally supportive of free scientific re- search, and particularly of free inquiry into human problems. So it might be argued that we live in a time when the very existence of psychology is threatened because the existence of our democratic society is threatened and therefore that it is im- portant that psychology throw its resources into

Professional schools for medicare and other health legislation, and the social

What are the future paths open to clinical psychology?
The first, logically, is the perpetuation of the
scientist professional model, with little or no change
in the traditional pattern of training as it has been
developed since it was established at Boulder and fessional psychologists in the community for reaffirmed at every subsequent training conference.
Under this model, the production of PhDs in clin- ical psychology took a leap in the early 1950s so that by the end of the 1960s as many clinical psychology PhDs had been produced as PhDs in experimental, comparative, and physiological psychology com- bined. American universities continue to produce PhDs in clinical psychology numbering about one- third of the total production of doctorates. But it is precisely this model which has been the source of many of the problems that I have pointed to. I do not believe it will survive much longer. There will be attempts to strengthen the scientific aspects of the model—to develop "experimental psycho- pathology" programs—but these will not be likely lo attract the students now seeking training or to
part-time teaching and supervision. The Chicago Conference on Professional Training very strongly recommended that graduate programs in clinical psychology appoint experienced clinicians to the teaching faculty, and, further, that clinical skills should be rewarded in the same way as research publications and teaching. Theserecommendations [ailed to take into account the realities of graduate education—the manner in which points toward promotion and tenure of faculty are accumulated. A professional school, on the other hand, can reward clinical excellence without the approval of graduate school scholars from nonprofessional areas.
There is little question that separate professional schools of psychology will produce primarily doc- toral level clinicians. Psychology's recent history,
these may succeed for a time until the problems of faculty status of professional people and appro- priateness of practicum settings catch up.
A second road for clinical psychology would be the attempt to establish separate professional pro- grams or professional schools of psychology. This alternative has much to recommend it for reasons already examined, and would gain for psychology the benefits of independence from arts and sciences graduate departments and deans, and from un- sympathetic experimental traditionalists within our own field. Industrial psychology has already begun to move its graduate programs out of the arts and sciences faculty and into schools of business ad- ministration and schools of management. Separate professional schools of clinical psychology are being proposed energetically by the National Council on Graduate Education in Psychology. One such school is already being developed by the California
psychology could train far more people than can be accommodated in PhD programs where lan- guages, dissertations, and other requirements slow down the rate of production. Professional schools can recruit from the very large number of young people motivated toward service careers.
Still another advantage of the separate profes- sional school would be that it would draw on pro-
 its status needs, and the already established state legislative programs for licensing and certification all would require that the graduates of professional schools be people at the doctoral level. But pro- fessional schools could also produce psychological technical specialists at lesser degree levels, some- thing that graduate programs have not been able to do.
The biggest barrier to the establishment of sepa- rate professional schools is the enormous expense— including the expense of psychological centers. This may be a barrier so formidable as to be impassable.
A third path for clinical psychology is a new major alliance with another profession that already owns a professional school with the practicum- training facilities that professional psychology has so desperately lacked for so long. I have been saying for years that as a profession exists to pro- vide services to the surrounding society, such services must be provided in some sort of institu- tion or institutionalized setting owned by the pro- fession. Medicine and surgery have offices and hospitals, and social work has settlement houses and social agencies, and library science has libra- ries, and dentistry has private offices, and educa- tion has schools. In all of these professions, the neophyte, after receiving thorough preparation in the theory, private language, and secret knowledge of his discipline, is sent for apprenticeship to one of these captive institutions, where he learns the skills of the profession and where he is further shaped in his professional role by experienced members of the profession.
Psychology has never possessed such a captive practicum training facility. For a time I thought that psychological centers were the answer for pro- fessional psychology. But I failed to recognize that a graduate school in an arts and sciences faculty cannot or will not operate such a center. We have little experience in providing direct clin- ical services to the public, and we have no deans or administrators who understand the need for such services as part of the training of our young professionals. Nor do our scientific colleagues understand this need.
Ideally, such centers should properly be part of separate and independent professional schools of psychology. But in the interim, they could also belong to someone else. We could join forces with another profession and thereby move our training
out of the inhospitable environment of the gradu- ate school department.
The programs could be located in medical schools. While I find this idea distasteful for many of the reasons examined above, we must at least consider the possibility of moving clinical psychology programs into departments of medical psychology or psychiatry. Another similar pos- sibility would be for clinical psychology to form an alliance with schools of social work or with schools of education.
We could exchange the teaching of behavioral science courses increasingly demanded by these ser- vice professions for permission to use their inter- vention resources and practicum facilities for the preparation of our own professional students. We could teach personality theory, learning theory, psy- chopathology, and research methods to medical students, or social work students, or education stu- dents, and train our own doctoral students in hospitals, settlement houses, or schools now con- trolled by one of these professions.
Because I feel that we can never win equality in a struggle with psychiatry and medicine, I favor an alliance with social work or education. We might work out a much happier symbiotic arrange- ment with one or both of these fields, and we would gain the administrative structure and the practicum facilities for professional training of our own.
A fourth alternative would be to take the drastic step of abandoning clinical psychology as a sepa- rate field. This would be a logical response to the possibly insoluble problems of training clinical psychologists in graduate schools, and the equally difficult problems of establishing either separate pro- fessional schools or new alliances with old profes- sions. This last alternative would suggest that graduate departments return to their historic role of preparing scholars and scientists to do the basic research and the teaching of knowledge that will be applied by other professional fields. Learning theory, personality theory, measurement theory, etc., would be given away to existing nonpsychology professions. Psychology would become a basic science for the profession of nursing, education, social work, medicine, and perhaps for new pro- fessions such as child-care and social welfare. Students seeking service careers in psychology would be steered into other fields. This solution is probably the least palatable to existing clinical psychologists, and perhaps the most attractive to
UNCERTAIN FUTUKE OF CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGY 1079
 1080 AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGIST
many psychological scientists. In terms of cold reality, it may turn out to be the most probable solution.
As the hand of psychological science controls the intake valve on aspiring professionals coming into our graduate schools, and as the more prestigi- ous departments cut off,or drastically reduce, the size of the flow into their clinical programs, or as these programs are changed into "experimental psychopathology" programs, and as the new schools of psychology fail to flourish because of the thin economic soil in which they are planted, we may witness the gradual disappearance of clinical psychology.
In any event, clinical psychology is going to disappear from the marketplace for a period of years. We are producing about SOO PhDs a year in clinical psychology in the United States, and with half of this number now taking academic jobs or postdoctoral fellowships, the number of clinical psy- chologists available for clinical work in traditional settings is so small as to be inconsequential.
Still another factor adds to the probability that clinical psychologists will disappear from view. This is the impending shortage of academicians in psychology that will lure clinical PhDs into teaching.
The National Education Association reports that college professors are lost, through retirement, death, or for other reasons, at a rate of approxi- mately 5% a year. This means that the productive life of the college teacher, all factors considered, averages about 20 years. (The average age of receipt of the PhD in psychology is 30.)
But psychology has had a far smaller rate of loss. Among academic disciplines, psychology has been a relatively young field. Most present aca- demic psychologists entered the field of college teaching after World War II, and so college teachers of psychology are younger than college teachers of English, history, or physical education. In addi-
tion, psychology is increasingly popular as an undergraduate subject, and so we have added young faculty to teach it. In undergraduate enrollment,
we have moved from an obscure twentieth place before World War II to position Number 1 today. Psychology professors have been young and numer- ous. But now we are entering a new decade, 20 years past the time when psychology took its great leap forward. I predict that our replacement need for college professors will take a substantial leap very soon. While much has been written in the popular press about the glut of scientists in the academic world, this situation clearly does not ap- ply to psychology. Very soon we will witness a large-scale scramble for new psychology teachers as replacements for retirees. It will come first from
the four-year liberal arts colleges where, as a gen- eral rule, college faculty members are older than in the universities. The frequent suggestion that graduate departments cut back on the production of psychologists, is based on a misreading of what is going to happen in academic psychology.
In summary, clinical psychology, as we have known it during the past 25 years, is unlikely to continue unchanged. I have tried to suggest some of the forces I see operating in the field that will influence its future. My feeling is that we will see a growing cleavage between scientific and professional psychology, that there will be an expansion of clinical training somewhere outside the graduate department, probably in separate profes- sional schools. Finding the roles of scientist and of professional incompatible when existing within the same individual does not mean that scientists and professionals do not need each other. The two
groups must exist in a mutually rewarding and symbiotic relationship. I feel that both science and profession will benefit from the impending division, and psychology can truly move forward in both areas as a means of promoting human welfare.

            <Text>A psychological career
Many of the psychologists and psychiatrists who were involved in treatments to change homosexuality began their training just after World War II. Many of those who started their careers in psychology were ex-Royal Air-force men, who, with their practical service training, intense life experiences and an adventurous spirit embraced new ideas such as learning theory and the practical and quick treatments offered by behaviour therapy. Richard was one such psychologist who witnessed the growth of behaviour therapies in clinical psychology and their influence on the development of treatments designed to change sexual orientation.
There was a feeling in the whole of society of let’s get on and get things done and be as practical as we can be...
I was born in the 1920s. I suppose I was brought up in a fairly liberal home which was pretty tolerant of different points of view. I joined the RAF during the war and discovered a lot of interesting people some of whom were able and capable and sensible, and some whom were stupid and ridiculous and that‟s what made me think I‟d got to study psychology because I‟d like to know what makes them tick.
After World War II there were only three places where you could train in clinical psychology. One was the Tavistock, one was the Maudsley and the other was in Scotland. Those people who had serious doubts about the value of psychoanalytic procedures would not ever consider going to the Tavistock to train as a clinical psychologist, so there were only really two places.
Those of us who wanted to work on experimental psychology would want to go to the Maudsley (psychiatric hospital in South London), so I went there. I found it quite interesting when I went to the Maudsley that several of the people there had been in the RAF. There was, if you like, a sort of let‟s understand what‟s going on, linked with a practicality. There was therefore a kind of need to combine research and experimental psychology plus a need to be practical and find out what can we make work. I think that combination did a lot to help to develop the so-called behavioural approach at the time. After all, the war had ended in 1945 and this was quite soon afterwards so there was a feeling in the whole society of let‟s get on and get things done and be as practical as we can be as we‟ve got a lot of problems to solve. And the other important factor I think at the Maudsley hospital at that time was that the psychiatry was grounded as far as it could be in Germanic experimental stuff.
The Maudsley‟s clinical course was created by Monty Shapiro under the umbrella of Hans Eysenk. The king of British Psychiatry at the time was Professor Sir Aubrey Lewis and he‟d invited Hans Eysenk to go to the Maudsley to establish a department of clinical psychology especially in research, which Eysenk did. And in that wonderful atmosphere for growth, Han Eysenk invited Monty Shapiro and Monty invited other people and they established what would not be called cognitive behaviour basis of psychology – in those days behavioural psychology. But it was essentially trying to apply the experimental process instead of the psychodynamic approach. The practical approach in a sense began or appears to have begun in the Maudsley but it spread widely from the Maudsley.
￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼1
It was to a large extent the people at the Maudsley hospital who developed the behavioural approach...
It might seem that we‟re over-claiming the role of the Maudsley hospital but it was to a large extent the people at the Maudsley hospital who developed the behavioural approach. Of course there was another additional important input from Wolpe, a psychiatrist in South Africa who had decided that the psychoanalytic explanations of anxiety and neurotic behaviour were not sufficient and he made an enormous contribution in his 1958 book, Psychotherapy by Reciprocal Inhibition. He did an awful lot to establish how we could attempt to reduce so-called neurotic behaviour, which he, and many people, saw as a learned response. Wolpe did a great deal to establish the treatment by reciprocal inhibition which was happening at the same time as the people at the Maudsley were trying to do the same sort of thing. So, some of the early work was published by people at the Maudsley, treating people with behavioural methods to reduce their anxiety.
Although I can‟t remember anything being taught about homosexuality in the clinical course I remember one person at the Maudsley with strong interests in different aspects of sexuality; cross dressing and people who had confusion about their sexuality. After the course I had several jobs in clinical psychology.
I was already accepting that there may well be a genetic predisposition in homosexuality...
Referrals from psychiatrists occasionally included a homosexual or a person with anxiety related to homosexuality. Then the Trethowan Committee considered the role of psychologists in the Health Service in their report which was published in 1972. In this report, it recommended that any medical agent could refer to psychologists in the Health Service. From then on quite a number of referrals came from GPs and that‟s how it continued.
I was seeing just now and again an homosexual person either referred by a GP or a psychiatrist. I can‟t remember how many I‟ve seen but a fair number. When I was working at my first job we appointed a psychologist who began a research programme on the treatment of homosexuality. Therefore, I was occasionally seeing people as a part of his screening programme, or if I saw somebody who was referred for treatment with anxiety related to homosexuality or for homosexuality itself, then he might in fact ask if he could use that person, if the person agreed as part of his project.
The project on homosexuality fizzled out because it was based on a misunderstanding that some kind of aversive therapy might help and after a while it didn‟t seem a good idea. I was unimpressed. At the time the psychologist working on this programme was working with a psychiatrist. This psychologist had quite an elaborate procedure to try to use aversion methods to reduce the homosexual interest in these patients which didn‟t seem to me to be a wise thing to do. It‟s trying to change somebody‟s inevitable direction. I was already accepting that there may well be a genetic predisposition in homosexuality, that it is not something that the person has chosen to do. Therefore, just as you might have some other genetic endowment, let‟s accept it and do what we can to alleviate the distress that the thing causes. It never seemed to me that we should want to change homosexual people.
￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼2
In 1972 I was invited to participate in a symposium where there was a lot of potential criticism from students about what psychology was going. I was prepared for a bad kind of reception – I expected criticisms or comments about aversion therapy. And in fact some of the questions I got from the audience were like, “Would you try to persuade somebody to stop being homosexual?” I replied, “No if that is their predisposition of their predilection then my job would be to help them to reduce the anxiety related to that and to make whatever adjustments were necessary.” I was never much in favour of aversion therapy of any kind really and an awful lot of people had been concerned about the treatment.
Occasionally there’d be a patient who said – I want to change...
I would help the patients that I was with issues surrounding their homosexuality to stop being anxious about homosexuality. It‟s a lot easier these days of course, because homosexuality is much more acceptable, whereas in the 1960s there were a lot of people who were really very anxious about their sexual orientation. Occasionally there‟d be a patient who said “I want to change, I want to stop being homosexual, I want to develop the heterosexual side of my nature.” And if that was what they wanted I would try and help them to reduce their homosexual interests and develop their heterosexual interests.
We need to remember that the discussions that went on at the Maudsley in the early 50s were constantly searching for ways in which we could understand the relationship between events, so again referring to the ideas put forward by Pavlov, Skinner and Wolpe, if a situation produces anxiety and at the same time there is another event occurring then by the process of conditioning it‟s quite likely that the reaction of anxiety will become associated with the unconditioned stimulus. By thinking along those lines it seemed to me that if the process of sexual arousal and gratification is linked with something, it may well become the preferred method of seeking gratification. It seemed to me that if a person wanted to stop being involved in and interested in male figures – so long as he had bisexual potential or interests – we might be able to utilise the other half of the spectrum of potential arousal signals. And, if we did that often enough, he then might be gratified by femininity. Here, I think it might be useful to describe two particular cases.
At follow up some months later he had started a relationship with a woman...
There was a teach who had got into trouble because of his interest in boys and wanted to stop because he wanted to carry on with his career without risk. He said, “I desperately want to stop my homosexual interests in boys and I would really like to develop and interest in a woman and get married.” We ascertained that there were times when he masturbated and that when he did that he used either pictures or images of young boys or young men. I think his range of homosexual interests was from boys aged 14 upwards.
I thought of this treatment myself. I said, when you masturbate presumably you begin by imagining or looking at pictures of boys and you continue the masturbatory process to the point of ejaculation. What you need to do is introduce pictures of women or girls – but not children – at the point where you have already become sufficiently aroused that you may well be able to maintain the arousal even though you are not looking at a picture of a woman. Having spelling that out in some detail he did that. He would get himself aroused – if necessary by homosexual imagery – and then would make
￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼3
himself look at a picture of a woman while he was masturbating. At that point, if he was successful, he would reach ejaculation and we were hoping that we could link the very useful gratification of ejaculation with the images of females. And I asked him to make sure that he chose feminine looking women, not masculine looking women so that he wouldn‟t, as it were, reduce the femininity in order to almost think of a woman as a man.
That worked very well in the space of perhaps a couple of months with him using this technique at home whenever he wanted sexual satisfaction. At follow up some several months later he had started a relationship with a woman and said that it was very satisfactory. That was one of the relatively few referrals who wanted to develop his heterosexuality. I don‟t know whether it lasted indefinitely but he was into a good solid relationship with this girl.
He was so pleased with the results...he rang me and said he would like to come and visit with his wife and baby...
The second case followed the same ideas, but he was probably sufficiently interested in women because he was bisexual and it wasn‟t as difficult in his case as it was in the other one. He was so pleased with the results that even though I‟d now moved he rang me and said he would like to come and visit with his wife and baby and they came and spent half a day with me. That was a fairly long follow up in that it had been several years and he was happy. For those people who simply wanted to reduce their anxieties about homosexuality that was fairly straight forward by helping them to recognise that if that was in fact part of their nature, then let‟s develop it or at least let‟s not be afraid of it.
The notion that you can treat behaviour without treating the way the person is thinking about behaviour is obviously nonsense...
I started using behaviour therapy techniques in the 50s and they were well established by many of the Maudsley psychologists then and that continued through the 60s and into the 70s. After that they tended to introduce the word „cognitive‟ so that it covered behaviour therapy as if somehow it was something new.
In fact if I was asked to give a word it wouldn‟t be „cognitive‟ or „behavioural‟ it would be „experimental,‟ because the notion that you can treat behaviour without treating the way the person is thinking about behaviour is obviously nonsense. It may be reasonable to start measuring behavioural responses in a dog as with Pavlov, but clearly a human being is far more likely to be reflecting on what they are doing, and on the implications of what they are doing and therefore on their thinking about their own response and other people‟s responses.

#### Labs / possible research proposals

Various students should be tasked with presenting proposals for research to the research committee, conducting that research if it is chosen, and presenting the findings at the following conference.  Not everything proposed can be carried out in an undergraduate classroom. Where it is impossible, the instructor should distribute the actual paper for evaluation *as if* it had been carried out. The instructors is, of course, encouraged to use classroom activities with which he or she is familiar. 

I've pulled a number of experiments from the APA's *Activities Handbook for the Teaching of Psychology* v. 1-4 that correspond to many of the topics the class will be discussing. They are listed here, and attached as PDFs at the end of this document, if you do not have access to the *Handbooks*. The characters listed here are *suggestions*.  The instructor should distribute these as he or she sees fit.

HAT are the prospects for the science Wand profession of psychology during the present decade? What are some of the influences that will affect our Association, per- haps in ways we would not choose if we were able
to plan our own course?
First of all, what will be the size of APA by
that we will fulfill Boring's prophesy for the year 2050. Indeed, I do not believe we will reach the 40,000-44,000 estimate for 1970.
Psychology's growth curve may reach an asymp- tote fairly soon and perhaps even before we reach the 30,000 figure. If we assume that 6% of psy- chologists withdraw from the field each year, we would need 1,800 annual replacements just to main-
1970? There are many ways to estimate a profes-
sion's growth. Fifteen years ago, Dael Wolfle tain a membership of 30,000. A 6°/o figure was the
(1947) estimated that the total membership of the American Psychological Association would be 16,000 by 1960 and 40,000 by 1970 if growth continued in the straight line it had followed from 1920 to 1947. Boring (see Sanford, 19S1) plotted a curve four years later that led him to predict almost 18,000 psychologists in APA by 1960, almost 44,000 by 1970, and almost 59,000,000 psychologists in 2050! Our actual membership in 1960 was 18,215.
foresee how we can expand doctoral programs be- yond the projections noted below. Unless there is a large expansion in Master's level programs during this decade, and an active effort to recruit these graduates, it seems probable that APA will stabi- lize at about 30,000 members.
I have used several methods to predict the mem-
bership of APA in 1970, but all seem open to ques-
tion. Our growth curve has been decelerating, but
a great expansion of college enrolments and gradu- will not be likely to exceed 1,200. It is hard to
ate school applications is in prospect. These anti-
thetical trends cloud the crystal ball. One method
of estimating future trends is to divide the number
of PhD degrees in psychology year by year over
the past several years into the increment in APA
membership for the same year. This gives a ratio
which should show short-range stability as extrane-
ous factors, such as the postwar degree boom, have
decreased effect. The ratios of new PhDs to APA rive at what seems a fairly accurate estimate. We
membership increments has dropped rather steadily from year to year. There is a choice of using a larger number of years and an average higher than the current ratio, or a smaller number of recent years to be sure the decreasing ratio is taken into account. Using both these methods, with United States Office of Education estimates of doctorates in the 1960s (Conger &amp; Fullam, 1959), I have ar- rived at an anticipated APA membership in 1970 between 30,000 and 33,000.
Our APA membership increased two and a half times in the decade 1950 to 1960. As our growth curve is steadily decelerating it does not seem likely
have exact figures on the total output of doctorates in the United States in all fields during the 1950s and on the output of PhDs in psychology for the same period. For these past 10 years the number of PhDs in psychology was almost exactly 6^°/o of total doctorates earned in all fields. Using the United States Office of Education estimates of the number of doctor's degrees to be awarded in the 1960s, and assuming that 6|% will continue to rep- resent the proportion in psychology, we can make yearly estimates of our output. Adding these yearly estimates we arrive at a total of 9,200 PhDs to be awarded in psychology during the current
90
best estimate of the rate of annual loss of college faculty members that could be made by the Re- search Division of the National Education Associa- tion (1961, p. 53) after a broad survey of existing information. It includes death, retirement, illness and disability, change of occupation, etc. It is hard to argue that our rate of loss will be any slower than 6% because of our higher proportion of women and our relatively higher than average tendency to leave the field for administrative and managerial positions.
The PhD output of our graduate schools by 1970
What will be the output of our graduate psy- chology programs during the 1960s? We can ar-
 decade. Now let us see what demands there will be for these people.
How many new college and university faculty members in psychology will be required in the 1960s? Ten years ago, a fair number of aca- demic disciplines were able to boast that at least half of their new college teachers had the doctoral degree. Along with psychology, more than half of all new teachers in the biological sciences and the physical sciences had received the PhD. Now psy- chology is the only academic field still above the 50% level. There has been a sharp decrease in the educational qualifications of college teachers in most fields, but especially in mathematics, English, and foreign languages.
There has been a growing demand for new faculty members in psychology. In 195S, 144 new full- time psychology teachers were employed in our colleges and universities. By 1960 this number had increased to 250. In 1961 the figure jumped to 320. In 1965, using a prediction method de- scribed below, we can estimate a need for approxi- mately 800 new faculty members in psychology and this number will continue to increase somewhat year by year thereafter.
In the first year of this decade the increase in college and university enrolments was 230,000. Each year enrolment in our higher educational in- stitutions will gain a little more than it did the year before until by 1970 the increase over 1969 will be 300,000 students. By 1970 well over 6,000,000 college students will be jammed into our colleges and universities. The 1960 enrolment was about 3,500,000.
In estimating the number of full-time faculty needed in higher educational institutions, the Re- search Division of the National Educational Asso- ciation (1961) used 6% as their estimate of the annual number of new faculty members needed to replace present faculty members who die, retire, or leave teaching. But this does not cover the in- creased enrolments.
This enrolment problem is causing uncertainty in estimates of future need for college faculty mem- bers. What is the extent to which increased en- rolments will be permitted to stretch student- faculty ratios? In estimating future needs for faculty, the Research Division of the National Edu- cation Association has arbitrarily assumed that some faculty expansion would have to occur but that we could not keep up with enrolments; per-
haps we will hold the student-faculty ratios to about a 20% increase.
Using these National Education Association esti- mates we can predict a real demand for 7,500 new college and university faculty members in psychol- ogy in the 1960s.
How many nonacademic psychologists will we need in this decade? If we continue to use 6% as the rate of attrition due to death, retirement, and other causes, and if we assume that we will find further demand in the nonacademic fields of psy- chology in proportion to the increase in the United States population, we can predict a need for 8,000 to 10,000 psychologists in nonacademic positions during the current decade.
It will be obvious that we are not going to pro- duce as many PhDs as the number of psychologists estimated as our minimum requirements. But if only half the total of new teachers and nonacade- micians are PhDs, we will come out even.
From this supply we will have to furnish addi- tional people to the growing option of private prac- tice. Nearly all of these will be new (or used) PhDs.
Let us look for a moment at the forces affecting private practice, particularly in clinical psychology. Just as public support of clinical psychology has
resulted in a marked increase in the number of clinical psychologists available, it seems safe to pre- dict that the public's growing and obvious willing- ness to support with fees psychologists in private practice will result in a sizeable increase in the number of clinical psychologists electing to enter this field.
How many psychologists are now in full-time private practice? While there is no answer to this question for the country as a whole, we have a number of sources of data which allow us to make estimates. Recently I had a student count the number of individual psychologists who list them- selves in the Yellow Pages of telephone directories in our 10 largest cities. Some 650 psychologists are so listed.
E. Lowell Kelly's (1960) recent survey of Divi- sion 12 membership found that 17% of his respond- ents reported private practice as their primary work setting. If this percentage of his sample can be extrapolated to the Division 12 membership as a whole this would mean that more than 400 mem- bers of Division 12 are engaged in relatively full- time private practice. Division 12 represents only
PSYCHOLOGY IN THE SIXTIES 91
 92 AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGIST
about one-third of the clinical psychologists who belong to APA. Continuing the extrapolation we arrive at an estimate of some 1,200 APA members (6% of the total membership) as the number in full-time private practice in clinical psychology. This is a very shaky estimate, of course, based on an extrapolation from an extrapolation. But it is the best guess we can make without much better data, and it does not differ appreciably from the 5% figure usually cited by the APA Central Office.
What are some of the factors responsible for the present and anticipated future growth in the num- ber of psychologists entering private practice? One reason, of course, is simply the fact that there are more psychologists than there used to be, and there will be more from year to year for awhile.
Other factors are also important. Our United States population is becoming more and more ur- banized and the private practice of clinical psy- chology is an urban phenomenon. Indeed profes- sional activities of all sorts are concentrated in urban areas. Psychologists turn out to be even more urbanized than physicians. In our 10 most highly urbanized states live 38% of our population, 43% of all MDs, and 55% of all APA members.
The principal reason for the growth in private practice of clinical psychology probably will be found in the acute and growing shortage of other professionals available to meet mental health de- mands of our middle and upper classes, particularly the shortage of psychiatrists. Elsewhere (Albee, 1959) I have shown in detail the fact that psy- ciatry is falling behind. Certainly our output of psychiatrists cannot be much expanded because this medical specialty is competing with other highly rewarded medical specialties for recruits from the limited pool of medical school graduates. As there is no immediate prospect of any sizable increase in the output of our medical schools and as psychi- atry will continue to recruit something less than 9% of the approximately 7,200 new medical gradu- ates each year, psychiatry cannot keep up with our growing population and with the need for replace- ment of those who leave the field.
Similar prospective shortages can be cited for other mental health fields. For example, there is a continuing manpower shortage in professional so- cial work and among clergymen of most religious denominations. All of these shortages seem des- tined to be chronic and to operate as a vacuum into
which private practitioners of clinical psychology inevitably will move.
Because the shortage of psychiatrists is likely to have such far-reaching implications for psychology we should look more closely at what is happening in psychiatry. In 1950 there were some 1,400 psy- chiatric residents in training in United States men- tal hospitals. By the end of the decade this num- ber had doubled. This sounds like a very sizeable increase. But in 1950 only 10% of the residents in psychiatric training were graduates of foreign medi- cal schools. By the end of the decade more than 40% of this group were from abroad. Two-thirds of the total of residents in our state hospitals are foreign trained. Often the attitude of the hospitals has been that it is better to have someone than no one. Recently the American Medical Association has raised serious question about this attitude with the result that qualifying examinations have now
been set up for foreign physicians to measure their competence in medical knowledge and in English. After December 31, 1960, all foreign physicians have had to be certified by the Educational Coun- cil for Foreign Medical Graduates.
Despite the sizable number of foreign physicians in residency training in this country, some 11 states in 1960 had no one in training in psychiatry. Ten additional states had fewer than 10 psychiatrists in training. In 22 of our states the public mental hos- pitals had not a solitary resident in training in psy- chiatry (American Psychiatric Association &amp; Na- tional Association for Mental Health, 1959). What do these figures mean? The number of psychia- trists available to that part of our population living in rural states, and to those hospitalized in public mental hospitals, is desperately short.
Of those psychiatrists in residency training across the country only some 800 were reported to be in their third year of training. All this simply means that we are not getting enough well-trained psy- chiatrists to meet our growing mental health de- mands. It is unfortunate, but true, that the fu- ture development of psychology is more likely to be influenced by this shortage in psychiatry than by any other single factor (save perhaps the teach- ing machine).
The increase in demand for private practitioners may affect the incomes of all psychologists. Gal- braith (1958) has pointed out that those profes- sions having the option of private sale of services are in a much better economic position than those
 in which the private practice option does not exist. Economically speaking one is much better off to be a dentist or a prostitute than a librarian or a so- cial worker! Even during periods of increased de- mand for professional services, charges for privately supplied services are likely to go up rather than down. With long-time endemic inflation a charac- teristic of our society, those professions with a siz- able proportion of their members in private prac- tice can adjust much more readily than strictly salaried professions to the increased costs of living. And even those professionals not electing the option of private practice must be better paid by agencies
in order to be held.
We have evidence that this economic law is be-
ginning to operate in psychology. Kelly's (1961) survey of Division 12 indicated that the median of male Fellows was over $14,000 a year and of female Fellows over $10,000 a year. These incomes are higher than the median income of psychologists in the National Register of Scientific and Technical Personnel (mostly PhD) reported by Levine (1961) to be about $9,000 a year.
Recently I did a mail survey of the Cleveland Psychological Association's Division of Psycholo- gists in Private Practice. I asked members of the group to report to me anonymously their gross pro- fessional income, and the proportion of their time they spent in private practice. For those respond- ing (85% of the group) median income last year was $17,500. The half-time private practice group earned $19,000, the full-time group $14,500.
The point I am making here is that all psycholo- gists, wherever employed, will tend to enjoy con- tinued improvement in their income because of the willingness of society to pay for the services of ap- plied psychologists, including those in private clini- cal practice. As this option grows, all our incomes will grow. Likewise, as sizable numbers of psy- chologists come to earn $20,000 a year, our social image, our power, our influence, and our conserva- tism will increase!
One of the difficulties with manpower estimates is that so often they merely project present trends and present ratios into the future, taking into ac- count population growth, increasing urbanization, and similar obvious factors.
Often they fail to take into account significant events which turn out to have a marked influence on future needs for professional personnel. The dis- covery of an antibiotic all but eliminated an entire
specialty area in medicine and created a whole new science. The recommendations of a Conant can go far towards eliminating the small high school, but can sharply increase the demand for counselors.
Many people predict that the publication of the final report of the Joint Commission on Mental Ill- ness and Health (1961) may prove to be such a pivot point in the whole field of mental health.
What are some of the implications of the recom- mendations contained in the Joint Commission's final report as they affect psychology and other mental health professions?
Many of the recommendations concentrate on the needs for intensified support of research, augmented treatment facilities, stepped-up care of the mentally disordered in general, and revolutionary changes in our present approach to mentally disordered per- sons. Nearly every one of these recommendations requires that we first break through the barrier of limited educational resources for professional man- power. While there are few signs that we are ready to make this effort now, it seems possible that the report will prepare the ground for a change in the social climate and we may witness a major effort to produce the professionals that do not now exist to implement the recommendations.
What are some of the specific recommendations that could affect psychology?
One recommendation concerned psychiatric units in general hospitals. The report expressed the point of view that no community general hospital of more than 100 beds is complete without a psychiatric unit. The fact is that at present only about some 600 general hospitals have any facilities for the care of mental patients beyond emergency admis- sions. This means that there are some 4,000 gen- eral hospitals in the country without such units. If we assume that a psychiatric unit in a general hospital would require the services of at least a half-time psychiatrist, a social worker, and a half- time psychologist, we begin to get some flavor of the personnel demands that would result from at- tempts to realize this particular recommendation.
Another recommendation is concerned with com- munity mental health clinics. The Joint Commis- sion recommended the modest objective of one fully staffed full-time mental health clinic to each 50,000 of our population. This certainly does not seem like an excessive goal until we consider how many professional people would be required to staff the clinics to meet this goal. Using the most conserva-
PSYCHOLOGY IN THE SIXTIES 93
 94 AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGIST
live estimate of our 1965 population it would take an additional 2,200 psychiatrists, 2,500 psycholo- gists and 5,200 psychiatric social workers to bring us up to this ratio for the whole United States. But there is one further difficulty. Because of the large number of our professional people located in highly urbanized states, and because of the pres- ent severe shortage of professional people in rural states, a much larger number of professionals would be needed to bring all of the states up to this goal than to bring up the country's average as a whole. While it is almost senseless to cite such figures, it would take nearly half of the professionalmember- ship of APA, the American Psychiatric Association, and the National Association of Social Workers to bring all of our states up to this modest goal jor mental hygiene clinics alone. (Of course, this num- ber would be increased if we decided to bring each county up to this desired ratio.)
Several other recommendations of the Joint Com- mission also would require enormous increases in personnel for realization. The needs of chronic public hospitals, children's clinics, intensive treat- ment centers, and follow-up care, all covered in the recommendations, increase manpower needs almost beyond meaning.
At the head of the list of recommendations was the proposal that a much larger proportion of funds for mental health be invested in basic research as contrasted with applied research.
If we must choose among the recommendations or assign priorities, in view of both the manpower picture and pure logic I would underline the neces- sity of making the painful decision to concentrate on training research personnel rather than treat- ment personnel. But most winds seem to be blow- ing in the other direction!
John Gordon, who was co-author of one of the Joint Commission reports, said in another context a few years ago,
No mass disease of man has ever been adequately con- trolled by attempts to treat the affected individual. Some progress can be made, there are ethical reasons for that approach, but if the objective is control of the condition in the population the fundamental approach is through defi- nition of the nature and extent of the problem, the recog- nition of causative factors, and prevention. A program based on treatment of the exaggerated illness is temporiz- ing and with no great promise of productive results; it is good clinical medicine but poor public health (Gordon, 1956).
It is obvious that simply producing more profes- sional people prepared as therapists from our gradu- ate schools and professional schools does not guar- antee the realization of the objectives outlined in the Joint Commission's report. If large numbersof our newly trained professional people go into pri- vate practice with middle-aged neurotics in high- income suburbs, doubling our output will be rela- tively meaningless.
We are torn between a humanitarian desire to do something to help present day neurotics and psy- chotics and the rational decision that only by re- search can we achieve our goal of reducing suffer- ing. Attempts to solve the problem of mental dis- order through approaches based on one-to-one, face- to-face relationships, however moral and admirable, are simply not sensible from a manpower point of view.
Sensible or not, the growth in psychology con- tinues to be in the direction of application rather than basic research.
The very rapid increase in the number of stu- dents entering graduate work in psychology has been accompanied by a concurrent change in the flavor and content of our undergraduate curriculum, thus influencing the self-selection of future gradu- ate students.
The self-selection that had led undergraduatesin the past to major in psychology, and has thereby provided the pool from which graduate students have been recruited, has occurred through the screen of a relatively difficult undergraduate curriculum. There is evidence that this situation is changing. In many ways, in many places, the undergraduate program in psychology has sacrificed rigor and diffi- culty in favor of interest and humanism.
Recently I had a graduate student tally some of the content of five introductory textbooks in wide- spread use today and contrast their content with five texts used 25 years ago. Briefly we found that present day introductory psychology textbooks have more than five times as many references to such "interesting" topics as dreams, hypnosis, neuro- sis, psychosis, and psychotherapy, as the text- books of the 1930s. Our modern texts, despite their greater length, have doubled the proportion of pages devoted to personality, conflict, mental disorder, and adjustment. Twenty-five years ago only one text in five mentioned psychoses or psychotherapy. Today, nearly all of our introductory texts go into detail on these topics.
 Because our undergraduate majors are, in large measure, self-selected as a result of exposure to be- ginning courses, it seems probable that our future recruits will be of different interest patterns and motivations because of the changing appeal in our subject matter emphasis. This change in the in- terest pattern of future psychologists will undoubt- edly be reflected in changes in graduate programs in the direction of more emphasis on methods and techniques of diagnosis and therapy and decreased emphasis on research.
The increase in interest in diagnosis and therapy will lead to a change in the emphasis of job activi- ties of psychologists with further effects on our image. A very small proportion of the Division 12 clinical psychologists surveyed by Kelly reported a primary interest in research. Only one-tenth of them were occupied primarily in research and only one-fourth of the group reported any research ac- tivities. Seventy-five percent were not doing any research! Who will argue that this situation will not affect eventually the content and emphasis of
graduate education?
Nearly 40% of the clinical psychologists Kelly
surveyed thought the next generation of psycholo- gists should be trained in a special degree program combining parts of medicine, psychology, and social work! It is doubtful that this group would agree with the recommendations of the Miami conference emphasizing the primacy of research preparation.
Finally, we are likely to witness an increase in the presently growing interest in legislation, and public relations, and in such professional matters as malpractice insurance, tax deductibility of psy- chological therapy, and strengthened professional
organization. Where will it all end! Eventually we may hear our APA Executive Officer testifying before the Congress against every piece of legisla- tion that smacks of socialized psychology! We will engage in cocktail party defenses of the in- alienable right of every citizen to choose his own psychologist without government interference.

            <Text>When the psychiatrist is gay
All but one of the psychologists and psychiatrists we interviewed reported that they were heterosexual. Below, William, a psychiatrist who worked alongside one of the leading consultants in the area of treatments for homosexuality recalls his experiences of becoming involved in these treatments. He recalls that one day he told his boss that he was himself gay and dealing with the ethical and personal dilemmas he faced in working in this field.
There was a fist fight in the foyer between some lesbian contributors...
In my very first year in psychiatry I remember the deputy medical superintendent at the hospital I was working at talking to me about a particular consultant’s work in schizophrenia and thought disorder, and I was just fascinated by what he was saying and thought that I would like to do some research in that area. Ultimately I got to talk to the consultant and investigated the possibilities of funding and he indicated he would be very happy to take me on as a research student and enrol me for a higher degree.
When I first came across the issue of treatments of homosexual patients I think it was around the time I first started working with this consultant. One incident that really stand out in my memory is around 1972 when I attended a conference that he had organised entitled ‘Liberation Movements in Psychiatry.’ This particular occasion was undeniably exciting and rather stormy, shown by events such as the fist fight in the foyer between some lesbian contributors and eggs were thrown. This consultant had organised the conference.
From about 1974 when I started working on my higher degree and this psychiatrist asked me to get involved in some other on-going research projects. This involved treatments of abnormal sexual behaviours of various kinds including homosexuality, exhibitionism and so on. Also later compulsive gambling became a very important strand of his research. Treatments included electrical aversion, electric shock aversion which was delivered to the fingers. I was with him when we investigated covert sensitisations and desensitisation or relaxation-type approaches. I think he was very much concerned to find less unpleasant approached than apomorphine or electrical aversion therapy.
He had a profound effect in enabling me to accept my own sexuality...
I was never directly involved in the treatment. My role was only as a blind assessor and see people before they had any treatment. What would usually happen was people would come in for a week for treatment and there would be three sessions a day for the five working days. Usually they’d be inpatients unless they just lived very locally and could come in I would see them before that week, at the end of that week and then some months later – I can’t remember how long the follow up went. I was kept blind to which treatment they had, because there were different sorts of treatments. Normally people were being randomly assigned to one or two different treatments.
Doing these assessments was in some ways a very strange situation for me to be in as I am gay. And actually meeting this consultant had a profound effect in enabling me to accept my own sexuality. After the particular conference I was telling you about, there was a party and I remember late in the evening telling the consultant that I was gay and
￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼1
that I was considering undergoing aversion therapy. His immediate response to me was – why every would you want to do that? And I just found that wonderfully therapeutic. I guess his reaction blew me right out of the water because it certainly didn’t fit the image of him. In the mid 1970s my old consultant became responsible for a new course, which they called Human Behaviour that was offered to medical students at the university. They had a couple of lectures a week and one long tutorial and each year this consultant devoted one symposium of a couple of hours or so to homosexuality. He would get several people to speak and one of the people he invited was a specialist who was well known at that time because of his book on homosexuality from a liberal perspective. I think my old consultant always takes on, or he’s often taken on very unpopular and difficult cases.
I had to go along with the idea that he’s an individual who’s really distressed with his sexuality...
When I was assessing people who were coming along for aversion therapy I was clear that they had all been referred from other psychiatrists. And so I understood that all of these people had already kind of been asked to look at acceptance as an important option. I assumed that they’d dismissed that and so I guess I just felt I had to go along with the idea that he’s an individual who’s really distressed with is sexuality.
There were various sorts of people who came along. Sometimes there were the really obvious ones like ministers or priests who would say that my sexuality is completely unacceptable to me because of my religious beliefs and I want to get rid of this embarrassing and profoundly discomforting part of me. Or there was the sort of young man who says I’m engaged to be married and I want to do the right thing by my wife to be. Or there’s the young man who’s had an involvement with the gay scene and says I just don’t like homosexuals and I don’t like the homosexual life style and I just want to have a normal life with a wife and children and that sort of thing. Those were the sorts of people who came along and I guess, although my own life was moving in very different directions, I just had to try and support them. At that time it did seem to me a very valid way of going about things, although it’s not the way I would proceed now; but I can only say that with the benefit of hindsight because the consultant’s work demonstrated very clearly that it’s not possible to change sexual orientation.
However, one of the most fascinating outcomes I found was that only a small percentage of the men who went through the treatment and who, when they came back, ultimately thought the treatment hadn’t had any lasting effects for them. A lot of them reported that they were less interested, or not interested at all, in men and that would last for at least some months. Also, some of them would say they seemed to be more aware of women than they used to be. However, many of them, by the time I finished seeing them, thought that the treatment hadn’t had any lasting effects and some of them actually took that as a license to fly! Basically, that they’d done what society saw was the right thing and that hadn’t worked and so the only option left was just to be themselves.
Look it’s not actually possible to change your sexuality that’s a given...
In the late 1960s, early 1970s people could still argue for the possibility that early childhood experiences of one kind or another may get people to learn their sexuality somehow, and if you can learn it then presumably you can unlearn it. the consultant’s
￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼2
very conscientious work established very clearly that you can’t. So if people say to me these days, I'm not happy about the fact that I'm homosexual, I can say very clearly to them, look, it’s not actually possible to change your sexuality – that’s a given, so that’s a starting point. I believe very much in an evolutionary perspective on these things and although it’s very hard at the moment to come up with some cohesive argument about how homosexuality, or male homosexuality in particular, fits into an evolutionary way of thinking, I think there are all kinds of fascinating clues.
I certainly had some arguments at the time with various people when I was working in the field of treatments. One really distressing argument was when I and some friends were out in a restaurant one evening. An argument ruined the dinner for everybody who was there because I and another young gay doctor were arguing about the rights of the distressed individual to try and suppress unwanted sexual feelings, versus on his side an argument about the harm to society of offering a treatment which only served to reinforce perceptions of homosexuality as a sickness. I wasn’t prepared to abandon the rights of the individual or trying to help the distressed individual against the more nebulous view of harm to society.
These days it’s comparatively unusual for people – maybe one or two in private practice and maybe one or two people a year – come along and say they’re really unhappy about being homosexual and what to do something about that. They are particularly people who come from a religious background and they sometimes mention organisations which purport to offer comparative therapy for homosexuality. I tell people that I'm dubious as to whether they really work.
It’s where I was then and in particular where society was...
Looking back I guess all I can say it’s where I was then and in particular where society was then. In some ways it seems to me when you hear the occasional person or read somebody now talking quite savagely about aversion therapy in the 70s or 60s. I think it’s very unfair the way they do that because they’re not looking at the context of the time. For example, when I was growing up there were no organisations supporting somebody who was gay. When I went through medicine in the late 1960s there was no university gay society. Where I was based, there was no open (as far as I knew) gay support group until 1970. It seems incredible now but in the six years I spent in the university telling my friends that I was gay not one other person disclosed themselves to me. People were frightened. Things hadn’t advanced really much beyond the 1950s where homosexuality was never even mentioned in the newspapers. Then in the 1970s there started to be a lot more information about the possibility of gay life as a real workable alternative lifestyle.

Biography
Judah (Judd) Marmor, M.D. (1910-2003) was an important Los Angeles psychiatrist and psychoanalyst, acknowledged for his leadership role in the movement to declassify homosexuality as a mental disease, which was removed from DSM-II in 1973.
Born on May 1, 1910 in London, England, Dr. Marmor grew up in Chicago and New York. He attended Columbia College as a Pulitzer scholar and graduated from the Columbia College of Physicians and Surgeons in 1933. Afterwards he began his postgraduate training in neurology and psychiatry and went into private psychiatric practice. Dr. Marmor began his psychoanalytic training four years later at the New York Psychoanalytic Institute in 1937.
After serving as a Senior Attending Surgeon (Lt.) in the Navy during WWII, Dr. Marmor and his wife Katherine moved to Los Angeles where he began as the Senior Attending Psychiatrist at Cedars of Lebanon Hospital in 1947. At this time he began visiting professorships in psychology and social welfare at the University of Southern California (USC) and the University of California, Los Angles (UCLA). In 1952, Dr. Marmor was appointed Clinical Professor of Psychiatry at the UCLA School of Medicine and a year later began as a Training Analyst for the Southern California Psychoanalytic Institute. In 1965 Dr. Marmor assumed the position of Director of the Division of Psychiatry at

 Cedars-Sinai Medical Center and in 1972 became the first Franz Alexander Professor of Psychiatry Chair at the USC School of Medicine.
Dr. Marmor rose to prominence early in his career in academic and professional psychiatric and psychoanalytic communities; he was known as a talented educator, prolific writer and a compassionate clinician. He was respected for his analytic work with Hollywood celebrities, his strong commitment to the civil and women's rights movements, and was also known to the public as Abigail Van Buren's mental health expert in "Dear Abby" advice columns.
Judd Marmor was also a leading figure in the movement to declassify homosexuality as a mental disease. Dr. Marmor worked for many years with homosexual patients beginning in the 1940s, and his first book Sexual Inversion and early publications regarding the subject were some of the first to feature biopsychosocial approaches to the issue of homosexuality. In 1967, Evelyn Hooker, chairwoman of the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) Task Force on Homosexuality, nominated Judd to be a member. The NIMH Task Force produced an influential final report two years later, the recommendations of which would have far-reaching effects for social policy, training, treatment, and government funded research.
From 1970 to 1973 annual APA conferences were disrupted by protests from gay activists. Shortly after Dr. John Fryer's now famous "Dr. H. Anonymous" presentation at the annual APA conference in Dallas in May of 1972, the Nomenclature Committee, Dr. Marmor then the Vice President and Dr. John P. Spiegel the President-elect of the APA met with gay activist groups to discuss the category of homosexuality as it appeared in the Diagnostics and Statistics Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM). In 1973, a DSM-II development committee led by Dr. Robert Spitzer put forth a vote to the APA Board of Trustees, and a year later the APA membership would vote to remove homosexuality from the DSM-II. Dr. Marmor had long been an outspoken critic of classifying homosexuality as a mental illness and was influential in many historic events that ended discrimination against homosexuals in the psychiatric community.
Dr. Marmor sat on numerous journal editorial boards and boards of directors, and was the president and/or vice-president of six professional medical organizations and societies; including the American Academy of Psychoanalysis, American Psychiatric Association, Group for the Advancement of Psychiatry, Southern California Psychoanalytic Institute, and Southern California Psychoanalytic Society. He was the principle author and editor of 8 books and over 350 scientific journal articles featuring a spectrum of psychiatric and psychoanalytic topics. Judd and his wife Katherine, a clinical psychologist, were also collectors of contemporary art. Both sat on the Contemporary Art Council board of directors at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA) and were known to have lent and donated artworks to LACMA and MOCA.
Dr. Marmor died on December 16, 2003 at the age of 93.

            <Text> CONCEPTUAL MODELS AND MANPOWER REQUIREMENTS IN PSYCHOLOGY
GEORGE W. ALBEE
Case Western Reserve University
IT is increasingly clear that the current and the prospective professional manpower shortages in the mental health field derive primarily from a set of interacting considerations that go somewhat as follows:
Disturbed and disturbing human behavior cur- rently is "explained" by a conceptual model which attributes causation to "disease" or to some form of "illness." The content of the explanatory model accounting for these sorts of human deviation dic- tates the specific kind of institutional structure which society must support for the delivery of care or intervention. And the nature of the institu- tion in turn dictates the kind of manpower required for its staffing. So we are confronted with a desperate shortage of medical and paramedical pro- fessionals required to staff hospitals, clinics, and centers. This shortage is going to worsen in the
years ahead as the institutional demands proliferate while the manpower supply does not.
Because of the primacy of the disease explanation for disturbed behavior, the largest share of available funds for training and for research is funneled into biomedical programs. These training programs are producing professionals who, after being trained at public expense, do not work primarily with these serious, chronically disturbed people who are the responsibility of tax-supported institutions (Arn- hoff &amp; Shriver, 1967). And, further, the biomedi- cally oriented research programs demanded by the disease model support complex laboratory research studies that have little relevance to the real etio- logical problems of disturbed people.
There is a current, popular platitude which says that the social and behavioral sciences seriously lag the physical and biological sciences in knowl- edge. If only, it is opined, we could make faster progress in behavioral science, if only we could learn as much about the human being as we know already about germs and atoms, then more effec- tive programs could be developed to deal with man's problems with himself and with his fellows.
This reading of the knowledge situation is far from accurate. We do know a great deal in the behavioral sciences, but many of the things we know are threatening to the mental health Establishment and therefore to the status quo. For example, we know very well that the nature of the social world of the infant and child in the family are of primary importance as determinants of subsequent rates of disturbed behavior. Tn our Western culture the stable family is the best bulwark against later be- havioral and emotional disturbance. Efforts at pre- vention of mental disorder should be directed to those social institutions that affect family stability directly or indirectly, positively or negatively. For hopelessly disrupted families we should seek new ways of providing the best possible alterna- tives for the children affected—whether in foster
homes or specially designed institutions like kibbut- zim.
When eventually alternative explanatory models for disturbed behavior are widely tolerated, and institutions based on them supported with public funds are available, there will still be real mental illness to keep busy the organically oriented psy- chiatrist. All of the emotional problems associated with serious central nervous system malfunctioning, seizure states, toxic and endocrinologically induced psychoses, and the problems of organically induced behavioral disturbances in general will be left. But of course these are not the conditions that in- terest contemporary psychiatry, perhaps in part because there is so little token reinforcement with these kinds of cases! Psychotherapy is the pri- mary professional activity in psychiatry, and mild neurotics are the preferred cases.
The mental health establishment has made so many promises to so many groups in our society that it is beyond the wildest manpower dream thai it can begin to supply these services (Albee, 1967). Let me just mention some of these new demands without elaborating them.
The labor unions, particularly the United Auto
 318
AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGIST
Workers, have negotiated contracts for outpatient psychiatric care for their members and families— more than two and a half million UAW people sud- denly have become eligible for outpatient mental health care. Other unions actively are establishing their own mental health clinics. Once one union docs these things other unions must begin to do them too, and all of these new plans require scarce professional manpower.
Perhaps the single most important recent legisla- tive act in this whole field, so far as manpower de- mand is concerned, was Medicare. Without going through all of the different components of Medi- care, it can be said for sure that an enormous new group of users of mental health services suddenly is eligible for prepaid or insured care. One of the most important parts of Medicare is Title 19, under which anyone defined as "medically indigent," along with their children, is eligible for outpatient psy- chiatric care and other mental health services. There will be very large new demands for profes- sional mental health care under this law.
Nor need we dwell long on the 2,000 new com- prehensive mental health centers that the National Institute of Mental Health promises will be built by 1980 with Federal, state, and local funds. The demand for professional medical and paramedical care in these centers is beyond all hope of realiza- tion. How can the 2,000 centers be staffed when two-thirds of our existing 2,000 psychiatric clinics are without a single full-time psychiatrist, and when little psychiatric care is available in at least one- third of our state hospitals (National Committee against Mental Illness, 1966)?
There is no point in discussing the Appalachian program, although it contains more extensive blue- prints for programs in mental health than the whole Comprehensive Community Mental Health Centers Act!
Nor need there be further elaboration on current manpower shortages in all the other professions represented in the 2,000 existing "psychiatric" clinics, the VA hospitals, the state hospitals, in higher education, etc. The point I hope to leave with you in this recitation of the growing demand for mental health services is this: All of the plans for increasing professional services for the aged, for the union members and their families, for the medically indigent, for the inner-city poor, and for all the others lining up for care—all of these pro- grams arc going to fail because we do not have
enough of the kind of manpower demanded by the disease model of mental disorder.
It is so simple. The explanatory model dictates the kind of professional manpower needed to staff the institutions. This means a current and future need for nonexistent medical and paramedical pro- fessionals. Since 1958, when the Bane report was made to the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare (Bane, 1959), it has been the consensus of all manpower experts that we should be producing at least 11,000 physicians a year in this country, if we are only to stay even in the ratio of physicians to population! But we are not training this num- ber. Currently we are training only 7,500 annually —so, year after year, we fall at least 3,500 new MDs farther behind the number that would be required just to keep our ratio of physicians to population constant. The only possible conclusion is that physicians, and, as a consequence, psychi- atrists, are going to be in even shorter supply, while all of these service demands I sketched a moment ago are mushrooming everywhere.
Elsewhere I have argued that the future avail- able supply of clinical psychologists and social workers is at least as inadequate as the prospective supply in psychiatry (Albee, 1967). The demands for academicians in psychology, for example, can absorb most of the PhDs we produce over the next decade or two. Because psychology is a relatively young profession there has not been a large re- placement demand for faculty members in this field. In other academic fields this replacement figure approaches 6% a year. As psychology pro- fessors continue to age we will need to hire replace- ments in addition to those needed for the expand- ing student enrollments.
Any manpower planning for mental health care as now conceived must confront explicitly these prospective chronic shortages of professionals. If we continue to use the illness model of mental dis- order, we cannot produce a fraction of the medical and paramedical people the model demands. This would not be a sufficient reason for abandoning the illness model, if it were supported firmly by research evidence. But the evidence supporting it is thin indeed. What I am suggesting is that we are in a manpower cul-de-sac because of the con- ceptual model we use. The development of alterna- tive models could lead to new manpower solutions because they would allow for new institutional solu-
 CONCEPTUAL MODELS AND MANPOWER REQUIREMENTS 319
tions requiring manpower more easily recruited and trained.
Eventually the demands of society will prevail. The times are ripe for new models, for new ideas. We cannot push along this social change unless we develop a new set of concepts, a new conceptual armamentarium, a new language, a new delivery system for service.
This reconceptualization must follow rejection by psychology of the illness model. But it is not simply a matter of blowing a trumpet and seeing the walls collapse! The illness model is sup- ported by powerful forces. There are many rea- sons for its persistence in the field of functional behavior disorder (Albee, 1967).
The model was developed, and it has persisted, because it was more convincing than the sin, taint, or demonic explanations. Also, the early success in finding the spirochete to be the cause of paresis led to hopes that other mental "illnesses" also had similar causes. Further, it seemed more and more as though genetic factors were important. The illness explanation also supported the practice of putting victims out of sight in plague houses until "a cure" was found. Money could be spent on chemical and biological research, without upsetting the value hierarchy in the society. Finally, both family and society could avoid personal responsi- bility for mental disorder. They could blame Fate.
Perhaps, however, the most compelling reason of all for the persistence of this model has been the absence of any alternative model. A scientific model will persist until a more valid and more convincing model appears.
Over the past 20 years there have begun to emerge out of psychotherapy, experimental work in the learning laboratory, cultural anthropology, and social work, to name just a few sources, elements of an explanatory model for disturbed behavior which might be called the social learning theory. This theory argues that most disturbed behavior con- sists of learned operant anxiety-avoiding responses. The origins of the anxiety to be avoided are to be found in traumatic social interaction of infants and children with the parents or parent surrogates. Evidence to support this explanatory model is ac- cumulating in the research literature.
I suggest that as psychologists we have played the illness game for 20 years and this is long enough. The rules of the illness game are such that there will never be enough professional people avail-
able to provide care except to selected members of the middle and upper classes. As long as the ill- ness model occupies the center of the stage, all of the planning, all of the action is going to deal with psychiatric treatment, mental hospital beds, and the Team. Psychology must create its own in- stitutional structure for developing methods for the delivery of service, because only in its own struc- ture can it begin to elaborate this new conceptual model—the dimensions of which I have sketched so briefly—together with the language and the in- tervention methods that eventually will permit peo- ple with a bachelor's degree (or even less educa- tion) to be the line workers in the field of behavioral disorders.
Let me emphasize that I do not see psychology as the care-delivery field. We can never have the manpower to meet the demands. Rather, we must create the theory and show how it is ap- plicable, to enable care to be given by bachelor's level people in habilitation centers that they them- selves administer. Psychology can only be the developer of the conceptual models and of the research underpinning. The parallel with the field of education is evident. Intervention in the educa- tional system is by bachelor's level teachers who are supported by more highly trained research workers from several fields. Only when institutions are built in which BA people can work with dis- turbed or retarded children and adults (perhaps Project Re-ed is the best example of what ] have in mind) will we begin to meet the demand.
Frankly, I find it astonishing that all of us as parents, and as citizens, are willing to send our children to the daily ministrations of school teach- ers trained essentially at the bachelor's level, and yet we insist that professionals dealing with our emotionally disturbed and mentally retarded chil- dren and adults must have far more training than teachers for their face-to-face intervention.
Let us start developing an institutional structure where the rules and language are based on research findings in behavior modification. Let us develop centers where technicians, nonprofessionals, re- habilitation workers of all kinds can be used to maximize human potential. Until we have a con- ceptual assessment system that uses indications of strength we will still be playing the illness game. The new model which I think we must develop will stress the maximization of human effectiveness. I have argued that this model will not be built until
 320 AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGIST
psychology develops it in its own service delivery setting from which we can also go out into those community agencies where the real problems are.
Once society accepts the position that most, if not all, functionally disturbed behavior represents learned patterns of anxiety avoidance, the institu- tions developed to deal with these conditions may well be educational in nature.
Albert Bandura (1967) has said it well:
The day may not be far off when psychological disorders will be treated not in hospitals or mental hygiene clinics but in comprehensive "learning centers," when clients will be considered not patients suffering from hidden psychic pathologies but responsible people who participate actively in developing their own potentialities [p. 861.
Unless psychology assumes leadership in develop- ing alternatives to the illness model, the mental health manpower picture is going to continue to get worse. We cannot train enough medical and paramedical professionals to meet the manpower needs of hospitals and clinics, but, more important,
we cannot use knowledge already available to deal with the pressing problems of our urbanized, au- tomated antihuman existence.

The central issue in this game—whether it be voiced in the selection of experiments to be run via the grants committee or in the classification of mental illness in the nomenclature committee—is the the nature of the scientific investigation of the human mind. For the psychoanalysts, as opposed to the behaviorists, the science of the mind is not about predicting and controlling behavior. It is about discovering the true things about our minds.  Thus, a treatment or theory is judged as 'good' or 'working' not if it changes the behavior of a person, but whether or not that person gains insight into their own mind.

When practicing a technique like free association or transference, a psychoanalyst does not seek to discover what a given symbol means to everyone, as a matter of a law-like generalization. Rather, a psychoanalyst seeks to discover what a given symbol means to the person being analyzed. It follows that a given discovery may not generalize over individuals. But that does not mean that that discovery is wrong or false. It stands to reason, then, that the truths of psychoanalysis are fundamentally individualistic, and as a result, one does not have the ground to criticize psychoanalysis until one has experienced psychoanalysis first hand.

The central task for this game will be to create a coherent notion of ‘mental illness’ or ‘mental disorder’ — homosexuality is only the tip of the iceberg.  When the game reaches that point, all psychoanalysts must work together to preserve a psychoanalytic understanding of mental order and mental disorder in terms of the dynamic hypothesis (see the game book for a definition).  The proposed definition should be something like:

	&gt; A person is mentally ill when he or she suffers from internal conflicts that may be subconscious or unconscious, manifesting behavior that is unwanted or disturbing to the individual or the society.

LJNTCAL psychology has entered a paradox- Cical phase in its development where its prob- lems of identity and relevance threaten it with extinction at the same time that its oppor- tunities seem boundless. The demand for clinical psychologists far exceeds the number available or
being trained. While able undergraduates in greater numbers than ever before are knocking on the doors of our graduate schools seeking admission to clinical training programs, these schools are ac- cepting fewer clinical students. Indeed, clinical programs are being dropped or sharply curtailed by many prestigious universities.
Professional psychologists are increasingly critical of existing graduate programs, charging that the curriculum is irrelevant and inappropriate and that deliberate efforts are being made to dry up the supply of future clinicians.
What are some of the forces responsible for this strange state of affairs, where everyone seems eager to expand training in clinical psychology except the field of psychology itself, particularly those fields of scientific psychology that control the graduate programs?
Let me suggest that the basic incompatibilities between the field of clinical psychology and the parent discipline have reached the point where only drastic changes may be effective in preserving the profession.
Our problems in clinical psychology are based in part on the location of our training, because this creates our ideology, our self-image, and our goals, and in part on the fundamental incompatibility of the roles of scientist and professional within one individual. Let me examine these two basic prob- lems in some detail.
Some years ago, Roger Barker suggested that a good way to predict the behavior of a human being

is to find out where he is. While I do not wish to take a position that suggests total control of behav- ior by the immediate environment, I would agree that a person does behave differently in a research lab, at a football game, in a cocktail lounge, and in an APA Council meeting. ] would also argue that for 25 years clinical psychologists have be- haved in ways responsive to the location of their training, partly in academic departments and partly in psychiatric settings. In both settings, they have
been treated as second-class citizens.
Clinical psychology is making the painful dis-
covery that academic departments of psychology in the faculty of arts and sciences are not the best places in which to train professionals and that the psychiatric setting is an unsatisfactory place to learn the ideology of practice. But it is hard to change tradition, even if tradition is only 25 years

old. Warren Bennis has observed that changing a university is about as easy as reorganizing a ceme- tery! There will be many serious obstacles to changes in the pattern of training of professional psychology. Let me direct your attention to some of these obstacles.
For one thing, clinical psychology differs in its origins from practically every other major profes- sion. Other professions began as loose organiza- tions of people delivering services needed by soci- ety, or segments of society, and the service was delivered in the marketplace. One received one's training by apprenticeship. If you wanted to be a social worker, you went to work in a settlement house or social welfare agency. Aspiring physicians were apprenticed to a practicing doctor. It was possible to "read law" in a lawyer's office. Gradu- ally, following a sociological law which says that aspiring professionals must learn theory and knowl- edge based on research before learning skills, pro-
fessional training moved onto the university campus. There it took root with separate professional facul- ties, separate professional degrees, and, for the most part, separate captive practicum training facilities where students could be apprentices of senior pro- fessionals. So, we find that all professional schools teach theory during the early part of their programs, but insure that their fledgling professionals receive extensive apprenticeship training in captive service facilities with successful practitioner role-models who often donate their time to the professional school in exchange for prerogatives such as bed privileges, honorific titles, or free office space and secretarial help.
Clinical psychology has a very different history. I will not tire you with its recitation because it is so familiar. Let me simply remind you that clinical psychology began as a small offshoot of academic, scientific psychology, growing within the confines of the graduate school where professional educa- tion was unfamiliar. In addition, I have been pointing out for several years that clinical psychol- ogy has owned no captive practicum training facil- ity of its own, and so, like the cuckoo, it has had to place its eggs in other birds' nests. In 1946, graduate departments of psychology accepted the invitation of the Veterans Administration to send clinical students for paid internships in their psy- chiatric settings. Experience in psychiatric settings quickly became mandatory—with the result that we became members of a Team in a game where we
had little influence on the rules and no choice of ballpark. Back home in the graduate department, faculty members teaching clinical courses were often nonscientific, or young, or adjunct, but in most cases low status. The clinical students had the worst of both worlds. Some adapted, some tried to outscience the scientists, and many identified with the aggressor and adopted the values and language of psychiatry. Clinical psychology does not control its own faculty appointments and pro- motions; instead, recommendations from the de- partment are made to a faculty supercommittee that consists of nonpsychologists including profes- sors from the sciences, arts, and humanities, most of whom are completely uninformed about the spe- cial needs and requirementsof a professional train- ing program. The present PhD programs in clin- ical psychology must depend for support on budgets controlled by academic vice-presidents, graduate school deans, and department chairmen, most of whom are either unsympathetic toward, or ignorant of, both the financial requirements of professional training, the need for professional staff qualified to teach skills, and the need for our own service- delivery programs for practicum training.
The establishment of separate programs for clinical psychology would be enormously expensive. Federal funding (NIMH) is the most likely source, and it is not a very promising one, not only because of sharply reduced funding in prospect, but also because historically the N I M H has served the psychiatric establishment. In view of its elimina- tion of psychology as a separate branch, together with many indicators in recent years that the powers at NIMH are engaged in decision making that reduces support of psychology training, I see no reason for optimism that very many separate schools of clinical psychology will flourish with NIMH nurturance.
The academic department is the wrong place to teach professional psychology, and the psychiatric setting is the wrong place for apprenticeship train- ing. In psychiatric settings, the clinical psycholo- gist in training learns to speak the language of psychiatry, learns to use and accept the sickness model, and often aspires to a career in the private practice of psychotherapy.
In adopting the sickness explanation from psychi- atry, the psychologist, perhaps unwittingly, sup- ports those cultural forces of reaction that delay the social changes essential to the prevention of
 emotional distress, and that bar intervention by modestly trained therapists. If mentally disturbed individuals are suffering from some unknown and undiscovered illness rather than damaged by a hostile and evil social environment, then the strat- egy for action calls for discovery of the cause of the disease rather than social action to change the dehumanizing forces of society.
Perhaps the most serious consequence for clin- ical psychology deriving from its near-total im- mersion in the psychiatric setting is that clinical psychologists and their students have been exposed to a very narrow range of human problems and, without any real opportunity to think about the matter, have accepted the psychiatric definition, confused as it is, of who is to receive our interven- tion. As a result, our selected treatment population is largely restricted to the two groups traditionally served in psychiatric settings. The first of these groups, usually found in the general hospital, espe- cially the university hospital, is the white middle- class neurotic who seeks prolonged psychothera- peutic relationships—people whom Schofield has described as having the Y A VIS syndrome (young, attractive, verbal, intelligent, and successful). The second group clinical psychology has learned to work with is the seriously disturbed poor who are incarcerated in tax-supported state and Veterans Administration hospitals. These groups are so familiar to us, and we have been brainwashed so long into believing that they represent most of the universe of emotionally disturbed people, that our textbooks, our courses, our case-seminars, our p e r - sonality theories, and our field work placements for students draw on experience with these groups. If, 25 years ago, enormously increased amounts of federal support for training in psychological inter- vention had been funneled through the public school system, rather than through psychiatric facilities, the present nature of clinical psychology would have been altogether different. Or, if psychological manpower had been supported and trained through the welfare system, we would be a still different field today.
What I am suggesting to you is that we try now standing back at as great a distance and with as much perspective as we can manage, to see what are the truly most pressing psychological problems that afflict our society, and whether clinical psy- chology, or some new field of applied psychology like community psychology, might not select these
more urgent human emotional problems as our focus after breaking free of psychiatric influence on our choice. Must we work on problems and programs only because financial support for them is available, or can we assume some responsibility for developing public awareness and then public support for intervention with the real problems of our society?
Let me suggest to you, as one example, that racism is a far more serious, pathological, and deep-seated emotional problem in our society than either the sexual neuroses of latter-day Victorians or the existential neuroses of the affluent. Racists do share some of the pathological symptoms we encounter in the clinic. The racist is delusional. He believes things to be true that are not true because such beliefs serve deep unconscious emo- tional needs, and his belief is unshakable by reason or logic. How much individual case-study have clinical psychologists done with the individual racist, and where have we studied the epidemiology of racism? Unless our society solves the problems of racism, we are not going to survive as a nation. Does this mental condition not merit our attention? Have we tried to do anything in the way of mean- ingful intervention with the racists? The mental health field has been enchanted in recent years with the development of store-front intervention centers in the slums where local indigenous workers, know- ing the language and culture, have been effective in working with the people of these depressed neighborhoods. But why has clinical psychology not opened its own store-front intervention centers in suburbia, staffed by psychologists who speak the language and understand the white suburban affluent culture, to intervene with the local inhabi- tants afflicted with racism and other virulent forms of prejudice? Why are we so much less threatened by the neuroses of sex than we are by the neuroses of hate? Perhaps, because psychiatry has had little interest in the pathology of aggression, neither have we.
Similarly, clinical psychology has paid almost no attention to the damaging emotional consequences of discrimination based on sex, and yet sexism, like racism, is almost entirely a psychological process, especially a learning process. Schizophrenia is one of the three major subjects each year in Psycho- logical Abstracts reflecting the time, energy, and resources we invest in studying this condition. T am suggesting there are other, more immediate and

pressing social problems that we should turn our attention to, problems not usually defined as "psychiatric" but which are surely psychological.
We have taught our students for years that mental cases include those people who are "danger- ous to themselves or others." But we have chosen to intervene with a very restricted range of those who are dangerous to others. Who is move danger- ous to his fellow human beings than the sophisti- cated racist? Racist attitudes and behavior, which can be found in a great many places throughout our social and economic institutions, including our state and federal governments, are far more dangerous to others than schizophrenia.
I would suggest as a further example that certain economic philosophies that are prevalent in our society are also exceptionally dangerous to others. An economic philosophy that justifies the maximiza- tion of profit at the expense of the safety, health, and happiness of the citizen should be as much a concern of the mental health worker, particularly the clinical and community psychologist, as more traditional forms of neurosis. In the last few years, I have been driven to conclude that an affluent white Protestant elite, which controls most of our major corporations and our banking system, and indirectly much of our government at all levels, engages in a mammoth, self-seeking, power- and profit-motivated enterprise which results in in- equitable distribution of jobs, resources, and health care, and affects even such fundamentals as life expectancy. The most visible victims are the urban black people, but T would hasten to point out that there arc millions of poverty-stricken whites in Appalachia and elsewhere who, together with the American Indians and the Mexican-Americans, arc
also victimized by the economic system. Women are also victimized and exploited by our system. If professional psychologists were truly concerned with human welfare, we could forget "psychiatric patients" for a century and turn our attention to the psychological causes of racism, sexism, and of the profit motive as sources of danger to the human- centered life.
I am not so quixotic as to believe that clinic;il psychology can have any immediate dramatic effect on these systems. But if we are not concerned with human contributions to human suffering, who else should be working on these problems?
The assassination of John Kennedy may have been a major mark on the bench of history. It is
possible that Kennedy's death marked the demise of liberal optimism for a century. The liberal expectation of the gradual triumph of human sanity and reason has had to yield to the fearful fact that good and humanistic forces may not ultimately overcome. While people in many parts of the world have believed for a long time that injustice and human exploitation are the inexorable laws of life, there has been cause for optimism in our democratic society that man might indeed be his brother's keeper. The death of the young hero sharpened our perceptions so that we are now more receptive to the naked reality of human exploita- tion and psychopathic manipulation of people by people. Harold Lasswell (1970) said at our Con- vention last year:
If the earlier promise was that knowledge would make men free, the contemporary reality seems to be that more men are manipulated without their consent for more purposes by more techniques by fewer men than at any time in history [p. 119].
Surely, the cynical manipulation of the masses by powerful elites is a subject worthy of psychological investigation. Which groups arc most "dangerous to others"? Our society locks up overt paranoids. But it pays honor and respect to the industrialist who builds automobiles that are death traps, who sprays our fruit with coal tar poisons, and who shows utter disregard for public good in a simple- minded search for profits and power. Why have clinical psychologists not been concerned with the motivations of the manipulators? When the Con- gress refuses to include farm workers under mini- mum wage and health-legislation, it dooms hundreds of thousands of children and adults to lives of hopeless poverty and disease. When giant chemical companies dump deadly poisons into our streams and lakes, psychology should be involved in apply- ing its knowledge to prevention of such destruction.
In brief, the relevance of both our curriculum and of our internship experience must be questioned if we are not to have our roles defined for us by the values and goals of psychiatry and of the prevailing economic philosophy.
But there is another serious problem as well. The truly crippling sources of cognitive dissonance in the professional psychologist, which may ulti- mately destroy the unity of psychology, are the fundamental differences between the scientist and the professional. A primary one involves self-
 criticism and mutual criticism. Science is open, and its knowledge is public. Any discrepancies in knowledge are debated openly. One of the hall- marks of science is its insistence on public dis- closure of findings. Graduate students in science are taught that research is not completed until the findings are made public. A freewheeling spirit of incisive mutual and self-criticism, replication, debate, and argument over procedures, findings, and interpretation of data, is ever-present. In sharp contrast, a profession must jealously guard its secrets! Historically, one of the hallmarks of a profession has been the privacy of its knowledge. Tf the knowledge of the professional, his techniques, and his skills are available to anyone, and could be performed by anyone, a profession would dis-
integrate. Secrecy and mystery are essential. Even a special technical language is a universal characteristic of the profession. Why were pre- scriptions written in Latin? Why does a profession develop its own jargon, its own secret language? Why are professions protected by strict licensing laws that actually proscribe certain of their activities to anyone but the qualified professional?
The first professionals, according to Veblen, were the priests who thousands of years ago guarded the Egyptian temples at night and took the opportunity to observe the transit of the stars in the heavens. They discovered that the flood of the Nile co- incided with the juxtaposition of certain stars. Im- mediately, they had powerful knowledge of great value to their society, and, like professionals ever since, they kept their knowledge secret, thus pre- serving the prestige of their profession, their credi- bility, and their godlike qualities. While profes-
sions exist to serve society, they must protect what they know, and they must always pretend to know more than they do in order to retain public confi- dence. In contrast, science abhors secrecy and does not tolerate faking or pretense.
One of the most serious problems for the scientist-professional psychologist (Boulder model) has been the requirement that he play the incom- patible game of science, and so subject his tech- niques, his theories, and his methods to open public, critical, scientific scrutiny. If other pro- fessions had to engage in the kind of self-criticism and mutual criticism that clinical psychologists are required to perform, they would be experiencing the same agony as we. Imagine the chaos if public
and open debate and criticism were the rule in medical office diagnosis, drug therapies, surgery, etc. Let me illustrate my point with one example-—• what could have been clinical psychology's most mysterious and powerful magic—the Rorschach. Here was a procedure that fulfilled most of the criteria establishing the power of an independent profession. The Rorschach belonged to psychol- ogy. It had enormous face validity and credibility, and it required long and arduous supervised train- ing before one could be expert in its mysteries and its mystique. Its powers were so great that all sorts of controls had to be placed around the preparation of those who would be using it. Twenty years ago, most of us believed in the art of the Rorschach. The public was fascinated by
the magic we owned. Other professions viewed our magic with respect. But along came the hard- nosed scientists, the measurement people, with their questions about reliability and validity, with their split-half techniques, and their demand for public demonstration of the value of our magic under strictly controlled conditions. As a consequence, the Rorschach is quietly disappearing from the professional psychology scene because of our pro- fessional sensitivity to the claims of science. Inter- estingly, the public still believes in the Rorschach. Similarly, the process of psychotherapy—a mysteri- ous alchemy of great power and public interest—has
been subjected to controlled studies, to long-term follow-up, to objective evaluation procedures, to the point where it has lost considerable credibility within psychology, although professional ingenuity in inventing new forms of psychotherapy has at least kept pace with the efforts of evaluators to catch up and expose it!
Another related source of conflict: The research methods available to clinical psychology are not as pure and powerful as those in experimental psy- chology. Inasmuch as the heroes of any profession are the scientists who supply it with its soundest, most valid knowledge, the weaker research methods of the clinician subject him to criticisms that only add to his inferiority feelings. Anthropologists tell us that there are still societies that are unaware of the relationship between sexual intercourse and pregnancy. Many of the relationships important to the clinical psychologist are of this sort, par- ticularly the relationship between childhood experi-
ences and adult behavioral disturbances. The

farther causes and effects are separated in time, or the more occasions where a possible cause is not followed by the possible effect, the more difficult is the relationship to unravel through research. The hundreds of years that elapsed before the discovery of the relationship between syphilis in early adult- hood and the development of general paralysis of the insane in middle age was due in part to the long separation in time between cause and effect. Further, many persons with syphilis apparently re- covered from their disease and never developed general paralysis. Also, many persons developed paralyses without developing the mental symptoms of paresis. It was so confusing! One widely held explanation of general paralysis linked it to frequent minor trauma to the central nervous system because it was so common in traveling salesmen who had to ride the hard seats of railway cars for thousands of miles each year, while the condition was remark- ably absent in clergymen who ordinarily stayed close to home and were not subject to such spine- jarring experiences!
Some of our current clinical hypotheses may sound as ludicrous in another hundred years. But T would argue that the truly significant relation- ships explaining most psychological disorders will still be discovered to be those between early trau- matic conditioning and subsequent adult instru- mental acts to avoid the effects of such early painful conditioning. Harry Harlow has given us a clear-cut paradigm from the animal laboratory, and Bruno Bettelheim has provided a rough clin- ical example with schizophrenic children. Much research in this area does not have the methodo- logical purity to satisfy the experimentalists. While both the scientists and the professionals are con- cerned with discovering regularities in nature, the scientist, particularly the experimentalist, can choose more powerful methods of demonstrating such regularities. Experiments that impose strict control on the operation of independent variables often lead quickly to the identification of signifi- cant relationships. The discovery of regularities in nature is accelerated in psychological labs where pure strains of laboratory animals are available, destruction of cortical tissue can be accomplished, and extreme conditions of stress, sensory depriva-
tion, infantile trauma, and similar drastic manipula- tions are scientifically acceptable and practical.
On the other hand, the professional, dealing with human lives, is thus restrained by humane and
ethical considerations that frequently prohibit such manipulation of experimental variables. The cli- nician, including the clinical psychologist, often must engage in life-history research rather than experimentation. Any student of research design knows the pitfalls and complexities of such meth- ods, particularly when causes and effects are sepa- rated by long periods of time. The discovery of significant relationships is difficult and uncertain. As a result, clinical psychologists are often the recipients of scornful criticism from experimental psychologists because of the flabbiness of their concepts, the looseness of their hypotheses, and the unreliability of their procedures. In a field that accords its highest status to its scientists, the pro- fessionals are again second-class and disadvantaged.
There are those scientists who would, if they could, impose a moratorium on professional activi- ties in psychology "until we know more about the causes of deviant behavior." Even in clinical re- search, the more "rigorous" approach (Spence's Type IV laws seeking relationships between organic substrata and behavior) has higher status than the investigation of Type II laws (relating early experi- ence and behavior), because the experimental or empirical operations are neater, more direct, and more acceptable.
Additional sources of friction and polarization emerging within psychology today involve questions about the appropriateness of lobbying and social action. Some of this activity is meant to improve the economic position of the clinician, as in the case of health insurance coverage. Other efforts are proposed to influence the public, through APA pronouncements, on a range of issues varying from abortion laws and sexism to Vietnam and popula- tion control. In general, most scientists in APA take the position that they should engage in politi- cal activities as citizens but rarely in the name of psychology. Professionals, on the other hand, have a long history of expressing opinions on issues having direct or indirect consequences for the pro- fession, often in the absence of thoroughgoing knowledge and consensus. Professionals are pre- pared to testify, to speak out, to pass resolutions, on matters that they regard as destructive to the human condition, or not in their own or the public interest. Professionals do indeed act more godlike, echoing another difference between science and pro- fession. The scientist wants to examine all of the evidence before he takes a stand in a controversy.
 away from committing himself prematurely. The professional, in contrast, is accustomed to making decisions on the basis of incomplete or even scanty evidence—he may be accustomed also to making judgments in life-and-death matters where he has only small odds that he is right. He acts in the best interests, he hopes, of the human condition in the absence of scientific certainty.
Among other professions, for example, social work has passed resolutions on a wide range of social, national, and international problems, and the American Medical Association has relinquished its tax-exempt status in order to participate actively in attempts at influencing legislation—in opposing programs like social security, medicare, health insurance, etc. The National Education Associa- tion lobbies actively for teachers' benefits. The sciences, on the other hand, are less inclined to speak out on social issues except where science itself is directly threatened. What is chemistry's position on abortion? What does mathematics have to say about pollution of the environment?
The Board of Directors further considered this matter at its midsummer meeting in 1969 in Boston and adopted a statement which said, among other things, that APA could take no official stand affirming or denying the validity of any scientific hypothesis.
The cumulative weight of these positions makes APA's response to social issues relatively limited and further polarizes the professionals. Thus, for example, the Association might work energetically to obtain an increase in training and research funds for psychology from federal agencies, or it might take an active role in arguing against the restriction of the use of psychological tests and research. It might prepare a position paper on the comprehen- sive community health centers program. But it would not take a stand on the conclusions of the Kerner Report, nor on the war in Southeast Asia. While it is likely that a majority of psychologists personally agree with the conclusions of the Kerner Report, and would oppose the war, these are not matters of particular and special relevance to the field of psychology in its scientific functions. Many

He is willing to permit any and all hypotheses a professional matters, and a limited range of ap- hearing, and he is used to postponing decisions on propriate activities in the general area of social their validity until more evidence is in. He shies problems.
The social sciences are less inhibited in these areas
than the natural sciences. The national social professionals feel otherwise and mutter about the
science societies most closely involved in the study of human behavior and social phenomena have had experience with disruptive tactics from their stu- dents and younger members who are impatient with the conservatism of the "Establishment." The anthropologists, sociologists, political scientists, and psychologists have had their meetings disrupted for two or three years. So have the social workers and psychiatrists. Such confrontation has led to posi- tion papers and resolutions on social issues. But there has been less of this sort of activism among the harder sciences.
Psychology has had to agonize for several years over policy questions involving public affairs. Should American psychology speak out on the war, on racism? The ad hoc Committee on Public Affairs, chaired by Leona Tyler (1969), wrestled with these issues and concluded that the Board of Directors should assume full responsibility in the area of public affairs. The Tyler Committee de- veloped some guidelines for decisions about ap- propriate action. Briefly, it suggested a wide range of possible association action for scientific matters, a somewhat restricted range of possible actions for
Establishment in psychology and seek to politicize APA, change its governance structure and its tax status.
The activist also may point to the statement in the Tyler Report (1969) which suggests that mobilization of APA to obtain governmental policy changes "would be made only rarely, in cases where the legislation or policy threatened the continued existence or progress of psychology as a field of knowledge [p. 3]." Is there not evidence, asks the activist, that war, racism, and population growth may indeed threaten the continuing exis- tence of our American society? Serious observers, such as John Gardner, warn that the nation is in real danger of disintegration. If the nation deterio- rates, psychology will be among the first whose existence is threatened. Tyrants and totalitarians are not normally supportive of free scientific re- search, and particularly of free inquiry into human problems. So it might be argued that we live in a time when the very existence of psychology is threatened because the existence of our democratic society is threatened and therefore that it is im- portant that psychology throw its resources into

Professional schools for medicare and other health legislation, and the social

What are the future paths open to clinical psychology?
The first, logically, is the perpetuation of the
scientist professional model, with little or no change
in the traditional pattern of training as it has been
developed since it was established at Boulder and fessional psychologists in the community for reaffirmed at every subsequent training conference.
Under this model, the production of PhDs in clin- ical psychology took a leap in the early 1950s so that by the end of the 1960s as many clinical psychology PhDs had been produced as PhDs in experimental, comparative, and physiological psychology com- bined. American universities continue to produce PhDs in clinical psychology numbering about one- third of the total production of doctorates. But it is precisely this model which has been the source of many of the problems that I have pointed to. I do not believe it will survive much longer. There will be attempts to strengthen the scientific aspects of the model—to develop "experimental psycho- pathology" programs—but these will not be likely lo attract the students now seeking training or to
part-time teaching and supervision. The Chicago Conference on Professional Training very strongly recommended that graduate programs in clinical psychology appoint experienced clinicians to the teaching faculty, and, further, that clinical skills should be rewarded in the same way as research publications and teaching. Theserecommendations [ailed to take into account the realities of graduate education—the manner in which points toward promotion and tenure of faculty are accumulated. A professional school, on the other hand, can reward clinical excellence without the approval of graduate school scholars from nonprofessional areas.
There is little question that separate professional schools of psychology will produce primarily doc- toral level clinicians. Psychology's recent history,
these may succeed for a time until the problems of faculty status of professional people and appro- priateness of practicum settings catch up.
A second road for clinical psychology would be the attempt to establish separate professional pro- grams or professional schools of psychology. This alternative has much to recommend it for reasons already examined, and would gain for psychology the benefits of independence from arts and sciences graduate departments and deans, and from un- sympathetic experimental traditionalists within our own field. Industrial psychology has already begun to move its graduate programs out of the arts and sciences faculty and into schools of business ad- ministration and schools of management. Separate professional schools of clinical psychology are being proposed energetically by the National Council on Graduate Education in Psychology. One such school is already being developed by the California
psychology could train far more people than can be accommodated in PhD programs where lan- guages, dissertations, and other requirements slow down the rate of production. Professional schools can recruit from the very large number of young people motivated toward service careers.
Still another advantage of the separate profes- sional school would be that it would draw on pro-
 its status needs, and the already established state legislative programs for licensing and certification all would require that the graduates of professional schools be people at the doctoral level. But pro- fessional schools could also produce psychological technical specialists at lesser degree levels, some- thing that graduate programs have not been able to do.
The biggest barrier to the establishment of sepa- rate professional schools is the enormous expense— including the expense of psychological centers. This may be a barrier so formidable as to be impassable.
A third path for clinical psychology is a new major alliance with another profession that already owns a professional school with the practicum- training facilities that professional psychology has so desperately lacked for so long. I have been saying for years that as a profession exists to pro- vide services to the surrounding society, such services must be provided in some sort of institu- tion or institutionalized setting owned by the pro- fession. Medicine and surgery have offices and hospitals, and social work has settlement houses and social agencies, and library science has libra- ries, and dentistry has private offices, and educa- tion has schools. In all of these professions, the neophyte, after receiving thorough preparation in the theory, private language, and secret knowledge of his discipline, is sent for apprenticeship to one of these captive institutions, where he learns the skills of the profession and where he is further shaped in his professional role by experienced members of the profession.
Psychology has never possessed such a captive practicum training facility. For a time I thought that psychological centers were the answer for pro- fessional psychology. But I failed to recognize that a graduate school in an arts and sciences faculty cannot or will not operate such a center. We have little experience in providing direct clin- ical services to the public, and we have no deans or administrators who understand the need for such services as part of the training of our young professionals. Nor do our scientific colleagues understand this need.
Ideally, such centers should properly be part of separate and independent professional schools of psychology. But in the interim, they could also belong to someone else. We could join forces with another profession and thereby move our training
out of the inhospitable environment of the gradu- ate school department.
The programs could be located in medical schools. While I find this idea distasteful for many of the reasons examined above, we must at least consider the possibility of moving clinical psychology programs into departments of medical psychology or psychiatry. Another similar pos- sibility would be for clinical psychology to form an alliance with schools of social work or with schools of education.
We could exchange the teaching of behavioral science courses increasingly demanded by these ser- vice professions for permission to use their inter- vention resources and practicum facilities for the preparation of our own professional students. We could teach personality theory, learning theory, psy- chopathology, and research methods to medical students, or social work students, or education stu- dents, and train our own doctoral students in hospitals, settlement houses, or schools now con- trolled by one of these professions.
Because I feel that we can never win equality in a struggle with psychiatry and medicine, I favor an alliance with social work or education. We might work out a much happier symbiotic arrange- ment with one or both of these fields, and we would gain the administrative structure and the practicum facilities for professional training of our own.
A fourth alternative would be to take the drastic step of abandoning clinical psychology as a sepa- rate field. This would be a logical response to the possibly insoluble problems of training clinical psychologists in graduate schools, and the equally difficult problems of establishing either separate pro- fessional schools or new alliances with old profes- sions. This last alternative would suggest that graduate departments return to their historic role of preparing scholars and scientists to do the basic research and the teaching of knowledge that will be applied by other professional fields. Learning theory, personality theory, measurement theory, etc., would be given away to existing nonpsychology professions. Psychology would become a basic science for the profession of nursing, education, social work, medicine, and perhaps for new pro- fessions such as child-care and social welfare. Students seeking service careers in psychology would be steered into other fields. This solution is probably the least palatable to existing clinical psychologists, and perhaps the most attractive to
UNCERTAIN FUTUKE OF CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGY 1079
 1080 AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGIST
many psychological scientists. In terms of cold reality, it may turn out to be the most probable solution.
As the hand of psychological science controls the intake valve on aspiring professionals coming into our graduate schools, and as the more prestigi- ous departments cut off,or drastically reduce, the size of the flow into their clinical programs, or as these programs are changed into "experimental psychopathology" programs, and as the new schools of psychology fail to flourish because of the thin economic soil in which they are planted, we may witness the gradual disappearance of clinical psychology.
In any event, clinical psychology is going to disappear from the marketplace for a period of years. We are producing about SOO PhDs a year in clinical psychology in the United States, and with half of this number now taking academic jobs or postdoctoral fellowships, the number of clinical psy- chologists available for clinical work in traditional settings is so small as to be inconsequential.
Still another factor adds to the probability that clinical psychologists will disappear from view. This is the impending shortage of academicians in psychology that will lure clinical PhDs into teaching.
The National Education Association reports that college professors are lost, through retirement, death, or for other reasons, at a rate of approxi- mately 5% a year. This means that the productive life of the college teacher, all factors considered, averages about 20 years. (The average age of receipt of the PhD in psychology is 30.)
But psychology has had a far smaller rate of loss. Among academic disciplines, psychology has been a relatively young field. Most present aca- demic psychologists entered the field of college teaching after World War II, and so college teachers of psychology are younger than college teachers of English, history, or physical education. In addi-
tion, psychology is increasingly popular as an undergraduate subject, and so we have added young faculty to teach it. In undergraduate enrollment,
we have moved from an obscure twentieth place before World War II to position Number 1 today. Psychology professors have been young and numer- ous. But now we are entering a new decade, 20 years past the time when psychology took its great leap forward. I predict that our replacement need for college professors will take a substantial leap very soon. While much has been written in the popular press about the glut of scientists in the academic world, this situation clearly does not ap- ply to psychology. Very soon we will witness a large-scale scramble for new psychology teachers as replacements for retirees. It will come first from
the four-year liberal arts colleges where, as a gen- eral rule, college faculty members are older than in the universities. The frequent suggestion that graduate departments cut back on the production of psychologists, is based on a misreading of what is going to happen in academic psychology.
In summary, clinical psychology, as we have known it during the past 25 years, is unlikely to continue unchanged. I have tried to suggest some of the forces I see operating in the field that will influence its future. My feeling is that we will see a growing cleavage between scientific and professional psychology, that there will be an expansion of clinical training somewhere outside the graduate department, probably in separate profes- sional schools. Finding the roles of scientist and of professional incompatible when existing within the same individual does not mean that scientists and professionals do not need each other. The two
groups must exist in a mutually rewarding and symbiotic relationship. I feel that both science and profession will benefit from the impending division, and psychology can truly move forward in both areas as a means of promoting human welfare.

￼An Experimental Study of the Small World Problem*
JEFFREY TRAVERS Harvard University
AND
STANLEY MILGRAM
The City University of New York
Arbitrarily selected individuals (N=296) i n Nebraska and Boston are asked to genwate acquaintance chains to a target person in Massachusetts, employ- ing "the small world method" (Milgram, 1967). Sixty-four chains reach the target person. Within this group the mean number of intermediaries be- tween starters and targets is 5.2. Boston starting chains reach the target person with fewer intermediaries than those starting i n Nebraska; subpopula- tions in the Nebraska group do not differ among themselves. The funneling of chains through sociometric "stars" is noted, with 48 per cent of the chains passing through three persons before reaching the target. Applications of the method to studies of large scale social structure are discussed.
The simplest way of formulating the small world problem is "what is the probability that any two people, selected arbitrarily from a large population, such as that of the United States, will know each other?" A more interesting formulation, however, takes account of the fact that, while persons a and z may not know each other directly, they may share one or more mutual acquaintances; that is, there may exist a set of individuals, B, (consisting of individuals 61, 62 . . . 6,) who know both a and z and thus link them to one another: More generally, a and z may be connected not by any single common acquaintance, but by a series of such intermediaries, a-b-c- ...-y-z; i.e., a knows 6 (and no one else in the chain); 6 knows a and in addition knows c, c in turn knows d, etc.
To elaborate the problem somewhat further, let us represent the popula-

tion of the United States by a partially connected set of points. Let each point represent a person, and let a line connecting two points signify that the two individuals know each other. (Knowing is here assumed to be sym- metric: if a knows b then b knows a. Substantively, "knowing" is used to denote a mutual relationship; other senses of the verb, e.g. knowing about a famous person, are excluded.) The structure takes the form of a cluster of roughly 200 million points with a complex web of connections among them. The acquaintance chains described above appear as pathways along connected line segments. Unless some portion of the population is totally isolated from the rest, such that no one in that subgroup knows anyone outside it, there must be at least one chain connecting any two people in the population. In general there will be many such pathways, of various lengths, between any two individuals.
In view of such a structure, one way of refining our statement of the small world problem is the following: given two individuals selected randomly from the population, what is the probability that the minimum number of intermediaries required to link them is 0, 1, 2, . . . k ? (Alternatively, one might ask not about the minimum chains between pairs of people, but mean chain lengths, median chain lengths, etc.)
Perhaps the most direct way of attacking the small world problem is to trace a number of real acquaintance chains in a large population. This is the technique of the study reported in this paper. The phrase "small world" suggests that social networks are in some sense tightly woven, full of unex- pected strands linking individuals seemingly far removed from one another in physical or social space. The principal question of the present investiga- tion was whether such interconnectedness could be demonstrated experi- mentally.
The only example of mathematical treatment dealing directly with the small world problem is the model provided by Ithiel Pool and Manfred Kochen (unpublished manuscript). Pool and Kochen assume a population of N individuals, each of whom knows, on the average, n others in the population. They attempt to calculate Pk, the probability that two persons chosen randomly from the group can be linked by a chain of k intermediaries. Their basic model takes the form of a "tree" or geometric progression. Using an estimate of average acquaintance volume provided by Gurevitch (1961)) they deduce that two intermediaries will be required to link typical pairs of individuals in a population of 200 million. Their model does not take account of social structure. Instead of allowing acquaintance nets to define the boundaries of functioning social groups, Pool and Kochen must, for the pur- poses of their model, conceive of society as being partitioned into a number of hypothetical groups, each with identical populations. They are then able
￼STUDY OF THE SMALL WORLD PROBLEM
to devise a way to predict chain lengths within and between such hypothesized groups.
In an empirical study related to the small world problem Rapoport and Horvath (1961) examined sociometric nets in a junior high school of 861 students. The authors asked students to name in order their eight best friends within the school. They then traced the acquaintance chains created by the students' choices. Rapport was interested in connectivity, i.e. the fraction of the total population that would be contacted by tracing friend- ship choices from an arbitrary starting population of nine individuals. Rapoport and his associates (Rapoport and Horvath, 1961; Foster et al., 1963; Rapoport, 1953; 1963) have developed a mathematical model to describe this tracing procedure. The model takes as a point of departure random nets constructed in the following manner: a small number of points is chosen from a larger population and a fixed number of "axones" is ex- tended from each of these points to a set of target points chosen at random from the population. The same fixed number of axones is then extended from each of the target points to a set of second generation target points, and the process is repeated indefinitely. A target point is said to be of the tth remove if it is of the tth generation and no lower generation. Rapoport then suggests a formula for calculating the fraction, Pt, of the population points which are targets of the tth remove. He is also able to extend the formula to nonrandom nets, such as those created in the Rapport and Horvath empirical study, by introducing a number of "biases" into the random net model. Rapoport shows that two parameters, obtainable from the data, are sufficientto produce a close fit between the predictions of the model and the empirical outcome of the trace pr0cedure.l
Rapoport's model was designed to describe a trace procedure quite dif- ferent from the one employed in the present study; however, it has some relation to the small world problem. If we set the number of axones traced from a given individual equal to the total number of acquaintances of an average person, the R a p p o r t model predicts the total fraction of the population potentially traceable at each remove from the start, serving precisely the aims of the model of Pool and Kochen. (It should, however, be noted that Rapoport's model deals with asymmetric nets, and it would be difficult to modify the model to deal with general symmetric nets, which characterize the small world phenomenon.)
Despite the goodness of fit between Rapoprt's model and the data from
1There is additional empirical evidence (Fararo and Sunshine, 1964) and theoretical support (Abelson, 1967) for the assumption that two parameters are sufficient to describe the Rapoport tracing procedure, i.e. that more complex biases have minimal effects on connectivity in friendship nets.
￼SOCIOMETRY
two large sociograms, there are unsolved problems in the model, as Rapoport himself and others (Fararo and Sunshine, 1964) have pointed out. The Pool-Kochen model involves assumptions difficult for an empiri- cally oriented social scientist to accept, such as the assumption that society may be partitioned into a set of groups alike in size and in internal and external connectedness. In the absence of empirical data, it is difficult to know which simplifying assumptions are likely to be fruitful. On the other hand, with regard to the empirical study of Rapoport and Horvath, the fact that the total population employed was small, well-defined, and homo- geneous leaves open many questions about the nature of acquaintance nets in the larger s o ~ i e t yA. ~n empirical study of American society as a whole may well uncover phenomena of interest both in their own right and as con- straints on the nature of any correct mathematical model of the structure of large-scale acquaintanceship nets.
PROCEDURE
This paper follows the procedure for tracing acquaintance chains devised and first tested by Milgram (1967). The present paper introduces an ex- perimental variation in this procedure, by varying "starting populations"; it also constitutes a first technical report on the small world method.
The procedure may be summarized as follows: an arbitrary "target person" and a group of "starting persons" were selected, and an attempt was made to generate an acquaintance chain from each starter to the target. Each starter was provided with a document and asked to begin moving it by mail toward the target The document described the study, named the target, and asked the recipient to become a participant by sending the document on. It was stipulated that the document could be sent only to a first-name acquaintance of the sender. The sender was urged to choose the recipient in such a way as to advance the progress of the document toward the target; several items of information about the target were provided to guide each new sender in his choice of recipient. Thus, each document made its way along an acquaintance chain of indefinite length, a chain which would end only when it reached the target or when someone along the way declined to participate. Certain basic information, such as age, sex and occupation, was collected for each participant.
In addition to the Pool-Kochen and Rapoport work, there are numerous other studies of social network phenomena tangentially related to the small-world problem. Two well- known examples are Bailey's The Mathematical Theory of Epidemics and Coleman, Katz and Menzel's Medical Innovation. Bailey's work deals with diffusion from a structured source, rather than with convergence on a target from a set of scattered sources, as in the present study. The Coleman, Katz and Menzel study deals with an important sub- stantive correlate of acquaintance nets, namely information diffusion.
￼STUDY OF THE SMALL WORLD PROBLEM 429
We were interested in discovering some of the internal structural features of chains and in making comparisons across chains as well. Among the questions we hoped to answer were the following: How many of the starters --if any-would be able to establish contact with the target through a chain of acquaintances? How many intermediaries would be required to link the ends of the chains? What form would the distribution of chain lengths take? What degree of homogeneity in age, sex, occupation, and other characteristics of participants would be observed within chains? How would complete chains differ from incomplete on these and other dimensions?
An additional comparison was set up by using three distinct starting subpopulations. The target person was a Boston stockbroker; two of the starting populations were geographically removed from him, selected from the state of Nebraska. A third population was selected from the Boston area. One of the Nebraska groups consisted of bluechip stockholders, while the second Nebraska group and the Boston group were "randomly" selected and had no special access to the investment business. By comparisons across these groups we hoped to assess the relative effects of geographical distance and of contact with the target's occupational group. Moreover we hoped to establish a strategy for future experimental extensions of the procedure, in which the sociological characteristics of the starting and target populations would be systematically varied in order to expose features of social structure.
The primary research questions, then, involved a test of the feasibility and fruitfulness of the method as well as an attempt to discover some ele- mentary features of real social nets. Several experimental extensions of the procedure are already underway. A more detailed description of the current method is given in the following sections.
PARTICIPANStTarSti.ngPopulation.Thestartingpopulationforthestudy was comprised of 296 volunteers. Of these, 196 were residents of the state of Nebraska, solicited by mail. Within this group, 100 were systematically chosen owners of blue-chip stocks; these will be designated ('Nebraska stockholders" throughout this paper. The rest were chosen from the popula- tion at large; these will be termed the "Nebraska random" group. In addi- tion to the two Nebraska groups, 100 volunteers were solicited through an advertisement in a Boston newspaper (the "Boston random" group). Each member of the starting population became the first link in a chain of acquaintances directed at the target person.
Intermediaries. The remaining participants in the study, who numbered 453 in all, were in effect solicited by other participants; they were acquain- tances selected by previous participants as people likely to extend the chain toward the target. Participation was voluntary. Participants were not paid, nor was money or other reward offered as incentive for completion of chains.
￼430 SOCIOMETRY
THE DOCUMENT.he 296 initial volunteers were sent a document which was the principal tool of the in~estigation.T~he document contained:
a.
b. c. d.
a description of the study, a request that the recipient become a partic- ipant, and a set of rules for participation;
the name of the target person and selected information concerning him; a roster, to which each participant was asked to affix his name;
a stack of fifteen business reply cards asking information about each participant.
Rules for Participation. The document contained the following specific instructions to participants:
a. b.
Add your name to the roster so that the next person who receives this folder will know whom it came from.
Detach one postcard from the bottom of this folder. Fill it out and return it to Harvard University. No stamp is needed. The postcard is very important. It allows us to keep track of the progress of the folder as it moves toward the target person.
c. If you know the target person on a personal basis, mail this folder directly to him (her). Do this only if you have previously met the target person and know each other on a first name basis.
d. If you do not know the target person on a personal basis, do not try to contact him directly. Instead, mail this folder to a personal acquaintance who is more likely than you to know the target person. You may send the booklet on to a friend, relative, or acquaintance, but it must be someoneyou know personally.
Target Person. The target person was a stockholder who lives in Sharon, Massachusetts, a suburb of Boston, and who works in Boston proper. In addition to his name, address, occupation and place of employment, partic- ipants were told his college and year of graduation, his military service dates, and his wife's maiden name and hometown. One question under in- vestigation was the type of information which people would use in reaching the target.
Roster. The primary function of the roster was to prevent "looping," i.e., to prevent people from sending the document to someone who had already received it and sent it on. An additional function of the roster was to moti- vate people to continue the chains. It was hoped that a list of prior partic- ipants, including a personal acquaintance who had sent the document to

￼STUDY OF THE SMALL WORLD PROBLEM 431
the recipient, would create willingness on the part of those who received the document to send it on.
Tracer Cards. Each participant was asked to return to us a business reply card giving certain information about himself and about the person to whom he sent the document. The name, address, age sex and occupation of the sender and sender's spouse were requested, as were the name, address, sex and age of the recipient. In addition, the nature of the relationship between sender and recipient-whether they were friends, relatives, business asso- ciates, etc.-was asked. Finally, participants were asked why they had selected the particular recipient of the folder.
The business reply cards enabled us to keep running track of the progress of each chain. Moreover, they assured us of getting information even from chains which were not completed, allowing us to make comparisons between complete and incomplete chains.
RESULTS
COMPLETION2S1.7 of the 296 starting persons actually sent the document on to friends. Any one of the documents could reach the target person only if the following conditions were met: 1) recipients were sufficiently motivated to send the document on to the next link in the chain; 2) participants were able to adopt some strategy for moving the documents closer to the target (this condition further required that the given information allow them to select the next recipient in a manner that increased the probability of con- tacting the target); 3) relatively short paths were in fact required to link starters and target (otherwise few chains would remain active long enough to reach completion). Given these contingencies, there was serious doubt in the mind of the investigators whether any of the documents, particularly those starting in an area remote from the target person, could move through interlocking acquaintance networks and converge on him. The actual out- come was that 64 of the folders, or 29 per cent of those sent out by starting
persons, eventually reached the target.
DISTRIBUTIONOF CHAINLENGTHS.Complete Chains. Figure 1 shows the
frequency distribution of lengths of the completed chains. "Chain length" is here defined as the number of intermediaries required to link starters and target. The mean of the distribution is 5.2 links.
I t was unclear on first inspection whether the apparent drop in frequency at the median length of five links was a statistical accident, or whether the distribution was actually bimodal. Further investigation revealed that the summary relation graphed in Figure 1 concealed two underlying distribu- tions: when the completed chains were divided into those which approached the target through his hometown and those which approached him via
￼SOCIOMETRY

Boston business contracts, two distinguishable distributions emerged. The mean of the Sharon distribution is 6.1 links, and that of the Boston distribu- tion is 4.6. The difference is significant at a level better than .0005, as assessed by the distribution-free Mann-Whitney U test. (Note that more powerful statistical tests of the significance of differences between means cannot be applied to these data, since those tests assume normality of under- lying distributions. The shape of the true or theoretical distribution of lengths of acquaintance chains is precisely what we do not know.)
Qualitatively, what seems to occur is this. Chains which converge on the target principally by using geographic information reach his hometown or the surrounding areas readily, but once there often circulate before en- tering the target's circle of acquaintances. There is no available information to narrow the field of potential contacts which an individual might have within the town. Such additional information as a list of local organizations
￼STUDY OF THE SMALL WORLD PROBLEM 433
of which the target is a member might have provided a natural funnel, facilitating the progress of the document from town to target person. By contrast, those chains which approach the target through occupational channels can take advantage of just such a funnel, zeroing in on him first through the brokerage business, then through his firm.
Incomplete Chains. Chains terminate either through completion or drop- out: each dropout results in an incomplete chain. Figure 2 shows the number of chains which dropped out at each "remove" from the starting population. The "0th remove" represents the starting population itself: the "first re- move" designates the set of people who received the document directly from members of the starting population. The "second remove" received the document from the starters via one intermediary, the third through two intermediaries, etc. The length of an incomplete chain may be defined as the number of removes from the start at which dropout occurs, or, equiv- alently, as the number of transmissions of the folder which precede drop- out. By this definition, Figure 2 represents a frequency distribution of the lengths of incomplete chains. The mean of the distribution is 2.6 links.
The proportion of chains which drop out at each remove declines as
REMOVE FROM START AT WHICH TERMINATION OCCURRED
FIGURE 2
Lengths of Incomplete Chains
￼chains grow in length, if that proportion is based on all chains active at each remove (those destined for completion as well as incompletion). About 27 per cent of the 296 folders sent to the starting population are not sent on. Similarly, 27 per cent of the 217 chains actually initiated by the starters die at the first remove. The percentage of dropouts then appears to fall. It also begins to fluctuate, as the total number of chains in circulation grows small, and an increasing proportion of completions further complicates the picture.
It was argued earlier that, in theory, any two people can be linked by at least one acquaintance chain of finite length, barring the existence of totally isolated cliques within the population under study. Yet, incomplete chains are found in our empirical tracing procedure because a certain propor- tion of those who receive the document do not send it on. It is likely that this occurs for one of two major reasons: 1) individuals are not motivated to participate in the study; 2) they do not know to whom to send the document in order to advance it toward the target.
For purposes of gauging the significance of our numerical results, it would be useful to know whether the dropouts are random or systematic, i.e., whether or not they are related to a chain's prognosis for rapid completion. It seems possible, for example, that dropouts are precisely those people who are least likely to be able to advance the document toward the target. If SO, the distribution of actual lengths of completed chains would understate the true social distance between starters and target by an unknown amount.
(Even if dropouts are random, the observed distribution understates the true distribution, but by a potentially calculable amount.) We can offer some evidence, however, that this effect is not powerful.
First, it should be clear that, though people may drop out because they see little possibility that any of their acquaintances can advance the folder toward the target, their subjective estimates are irrelevant to the question just raised. Such subjective estimates may account for individual decisions not to participate; they do not tell us whether chains that die in fact would have been longer than others had they gone to completion. People have poor intuitions concerning the lengths of acquaintance chains. Moreover, people can rarely see beyond their own acquaintances; it is hard to guess the circles in which friends of friends-not to mention people even more remotely con- nected to oneself-may move.
More direct evidence that dropouts may be treated as "random" can be gleaned from the tracer cards. It will be recalled that each participant was asked for information not only about himself but also about the person to whom he sent the document. Thus some data were available even for dropouts, namely age, sex, the nature of their relationship to the people

preceding them in the chain, and the reason the dropout had been selected to receive the document. These four variables were tabulated for dropouts versus non-dropouts. None of the resulting contingency tables achieved the .05 level of statistical significance by chi-square test; we are therefore led to accept the null hypothesis of no difference between the two groups, at least on this limited set of variables. Of course, a definitive answer to the question of whether dropouts are really random must wait until the deter- minants of chain length are understood, or until a way is found to force all chains to ~ompletion.~
SUBPOPULATIOCNOMPARISONAS.possible paradigm for future research using the tracing procedure described here involves systematic variation of the relationship between the starting and target populations. One such study, using Negro and White starting and target groups, has already been com- pleted by Korte and Milgram (in press). In the present study, which involved only a single target person, three starting populations were used (Nebraska random, Nebraska stockholders, and Boston random.) The relevant experi- mental questions were whether the proportion of completed chains or mean chain lengths would vary as a function of starting population.
ChainLength. Letters from the Nebraska subpopulations had to cover a geographic distance of about 1300 miles in order to reach the target, whereas letters originating in the Boston group almost all started within 25 miles of his home and/or place of work. Since social proximity depends in part on geographic proximity, one might readily predict that complete chains originating in the Boston area would be shorter than those originating in Nebraska. This presumption was confirmed by the data. As Table 2 shows, chains originating with the Boston random group showed a mean length of 4.4 intermediaries between starters and target, as opposed to a mean
length of 5.7 intermediaries for the Nebraska random group. (p-L.001 by
4 Professor Harrison White of Harvard University has developed a technique for adjust- ing raw chain length data to take account of the dropout problem. His method assumes that dropouts are "random," in the following sense. An intermediary who knows the target sends him the folder, completing the chain, with probability 1. Otherwise, an intermediary throws away the folder with fixed probability 1-a, or sends it on with probability a. If sent on, there is a probability Qi (which depends on number of removes from the origin) that the next intermediary knows the target. The data is consistent with a value for a of approximately 0.75, independent of remove from the origin, and hence with a "random" dropout rate of 25 per cent. The limited data further suggest that Qi grows in a "staircase" pattern from zero (at zero removes from the starting population) to approximately one-third at six removes, remaining constant thereafter. Based on these values, the hypothetical curve of completions with no dropouts resembles the observed curve shifted upward; the median length of completed chains rises from 5 to 7, but no substantial alteration is required in conclusions drawn from the raw data.

a one-tailed Mann-Whitney U test.) Chain length thus proved sensitive to one demographic variable-place of residence of starters and target.
The Nebraska stockholder group was presumed to have easy access to contacts in the brokerage business. Because the target person was a stock- broker, chains originating in this group were expected to reach the target more efficiently than chains from the Nebraska random group. The chain- length means for the two groups, 5.7 intermediaries for the random sample and 5.4 for the stockholders, differed in the expected direction, but the difference was not statistically significant by the Mann-Whitney test. The stockholders used the brokerage business as a communication channel more often than did the random group; 60.7 per cent of all the participants in chains originating with the stockholder group reported occupations connected with finance, while 31.8 per cent of participants in chains originating in the Nebraska random group were so classified.
Proportion of Completions. As indicated in Table 3, the proportions of chains completed for the Nebraska random, Nebraska stockholder, and Boston subpopulations were 24 per cent, 31 per cent and 35 per cent, respectively. Although the differences are not statistically significant, there is a weak tendency for higher completion rates to occur in groups where mean length of completed chains is shorter. This result deserves brief discussion.
Let us assume that the dropout rate is constant at each remove from the start. If, for example, the dropout rate were 25 per cent then any chain would have a 75 per cent probability of reaching one link, (.75)=of reaching two links, etc. Thus, the longer a chain needed to be in order to reach comple- tion, the less likely that the chain would survive long enough to run its full course. In this case, however, chain-length differences among the three groups were not sufficiently large to produce significant differences in completion rate. Moreover, if the dropout rate declines as chains grow long, such a de- crease would off-set the effect just discussed and weaken the observed inverse relation between chain length and proportion of completions.

The 64 letters which reached the target were sent by a total of 26 people. Sixteen, fully 25 per cent, reached the target through a single neighbor. Another 10 made contact through a single business associate, and 5 through a second business associate. These three "penultimate links" together accounted for 48 per cent of the total com- pletions. Among the three, an interesting division of labor appears. Mr. G,

who accounted for 16 completions, is a clothing merchant in the target's hometown of Sharon; Mr. G funnelled toward the target those chains which were advancing on the basis of the target's place of residence. Twenty-four chains reached the target from his hometown; Mr. G accounted for of those completions. All the letters which reached Mr. G came from residents of Sharon. By contrast, Mr. D and Mr. P, who accounted for 10 and 5 completions, respectively, were contacted by people scattered around the Boston area, and in several cases, by people living in other cities entirely. On the other hand, whereas Mr. G received the folder from Sharon residents in a wide variety of occupations, D and P received it almost always from stockbrokers. A scattering of names appear two or three times on the list of penultimate links; seventeen names appear once each.
Convergence appeared even before the penultimate link. Going one step further back, to people two removes from the target, we find that the 64 chains passed through 55 individuals. One man, Mr. B, appeared 5 times, and on all occasions sent the document to Mr. G. Other individuals appeared two or three times each.
ADDITIONACLHARACTERISTIOCFSCHAINS.Eighty-six per cent of the par- ticipants sent the folder to persons they described as friends and acquaint- ances; 14 per cent sent i t to relatives. T h e same percentages had been observed in an earlier pilot study.
Data on patterns of age, sex and occupation support the plausible hy- pothesis that participants select recipients from a pool of individuals similar to themselves. The data on age support the hypothesis unequivocally; the data on sex and occupation are complicated by the characteristics of the target and the special requirement of establishing contact with him.
Age was bracketed into ten-year categories and the ages of those who sent the document tabled against the ages of those to whom they sent it. On inspection the table showed a strong tendency to cluster around the diagonal, and a chi-square test showed the association to be significant at better than the ,001 level.
Similarly, the sex of each sender was tabled against the sex of the corresponding recipient. Men were ten times more likely to send the docu- ment to other men than to women, while women were equally likely to send the folder to males as to females (p&lt;.001).These results were affected by the fact that the target was male. In an earlier pilot study using a female target, both men and women were three times as likely to send the document to members of the same sex as to members of the opposite sex. Thus there appear to be three tendencies governing the sex of the recipient: (1)there is a tendency to send the document to someone of one's own sex, but (2) women are more likely to cross sex lines than men, and (3) there
￼STUDY OF THE SMALL WORLD PROBLEM 441
is a tendency to send the document to someone of the same sex as the target person.
The occupations reported by participants were rated on two com- ponents--one of social status and one of "industry" affiliation, that is, the subsector of the economy with which the individual would be likely to deal. The coding system was ad hoc, designed to fit the occupational titles supplied by participants. Tabling the status and "industry" ratings for all senders of the document against those of respective recipients, we observed a strong tendency for people to select recipients similar to themselves on both measures (p&lt;.001 for both tables). However, the strength of the relationship for industry seemed to be largely due to a tendency for the folder to stay within the finance field once it arrived there, obviously because the target was affiliated with that field. More- over, the participants in the study were a heavily middle-class sample, and the target was himself a member of that class. Thus there was no need for the document to leave middle-class circles in progressing from starters to target.
When separate contingency tables were constructed for complete and in- complete chains, the above results were obtained for both tables. Similarly, when separate tables were constructed for chains originating in the 3 starting populations, the findings held up in all 3 tables. Thus, controlling for com- pletion of chains or for starting population did not affect the finding of demographic homogeneity within chains.
CONCLUSIONS
The contribution of the study lies in the use of acquaintance chains to extend an individual's contacts to a geographically and socially remote target, and in the sheer size of the population from which members of the chains were drawn. The study demonstrated the feasibility of the "small world" technique, and took a step toward demonstrating, defining and measuring inter-connectedness in a large society.
The theoretical machinery needed to deal with social networks is still in its infancy. The empirical technique of this research has two major con- tributions to make to the development of that theory. First, it sets an upper bound on the minimum number of intermediaries required to link widely separated Americans. Since subjects cannot always foresee the most efficient path to a target, our trace procedure must inevitably produce chains longer than those generated by an accurate theoretical model which takes full account of all paths emanating from an individual. The mean number of intermediaries observed in this study was somewhat greater than five;
￼442 SOCIOMETRY
additional research (by Korte and Milgram) indicates that this value is quite stable, even when racial crossover is introduced. Both the magnitude and stability of the parameter need to be accounted for. Second, the study has uncovered several phenomena which future models should explain. In particular, the convergence of communication chains through common indi- viduals is an important feature of small world nets, and it should be accounted for theoretically.
There are many additional lines of empirical research that may be ex- amined with the small world method. As suggested earlier, one general paradigm for research is to vary the characteristics of the starting person and the target. Further, one might systematically vary the information pro- vided about the target in order to determine, on the psychological side, what strategies people employ in reaching a distant target, and on the sociological side, what specific variables are critical for establishing contact between people of given characteristics.

Rockefeller University
HE most urgent problems of our world today Tare the problems we have made for ourselves. They have not been caused by some heedless or malicious inanimate Nature, nor have they been imposed on us as punishment by the will of God, They are human problems whose solutions will re- quire us to change our behavior and our social
institutions.
As a science directly concerned with behavioral
and social processes, psychology might be ex- pected to provide intellectual leadership in the search for new and better personal and social ar- rangements. In fact, however, we psychologists have contributed relatively little of real importance —even less than our rather modest understanding of behavior might justify. We should have con- tributed more; although our scientific base for valid contributions is far from comprehensive, cer- tainly more is known than has been used intel- ligently.
This is the social challenge that psychologists face. In the years immediately ahead we must not only extend and deepen our understanding of mental and behavioral phenomena, but we must somehow incorporate our hard-won knowledge more effectively into the vast social changes that we all know are coming. It is both important and appropriate for us, on occasions such as this, to consider how best to meet this social challenge.
In opening such a discussion, however, we should keep clearly in mind that society has not com-

Presidential Address to the American Psychological As- sociation in Washington, D. C., September 1969. It is customary on this occasion to summarize one's own re- search. Although that would be a more comfortable role, I have decided instead to take this opportunity to ex- press some personal opinions about the current state of our discipline and its potential role in meeting the human problems of our society. This departure from tradition is intended to honor the theme of the 1969 Convention, "Psychology and the Problems of Society." I am indebted to several friends, and especially to J . A. Varela, for critical comments on earlier drafts.

missioned us to cure its ills; a challenge is not a mandate. Moreover, there is nothing in the defini- tion of psychology that dedicates our science to the solution of social problems. Our inability to solve the pressing problems of the day cannot be interpreted as an indictment of the scientific validity of our psychological theories. As scientists we are obliged to communicate what we know, but we have no special obligation to solve social problems.
Our obligations as citizens, however, are con- siderably broader than our obligations as scientists. When psychological issues are raised in this broader context, we cannot evade them by complaining that they are unscientific. If we have something of practical value to contribute, we should make every effort to insure that it is implemented.
I believe that the majority of American psy- chologists have accepted this broader interpreta- tion of our responsibilities and have been eager— perhaps, sometimes, overly eager—to apply our science to social problems. We have not been aloof or insensitive; the bulk of our profession works full time on exactly such problems. And I do not wish to discount the many and often successful efforts toward application that we have made al- ready. Yet I cannot escape the impression that we have been less effective than we might, have been. "Why" and "what more might be done" are questions that have troubled me increasingly in recent years.
First, however, I would like to raise a somewhat parochial question.
ROLE OF THE AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION
If we accept this challenge to use psychology to solve social problems, what role should we ex- pect the American Psychological Association to play? I raise this question because my experi- ence as an officer of APA has taught me that many of our members look to their national organization for leadership in insuring that our scientific and professional activities have greater social relevance.

AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGIST
Psychologists have been well represented among those who sign petitions of political protest (Ladd, 1969), and they have not failed to make their opinions heard in their own national headquarters. Scarcely a meeting of the Board of Directors in recent years has not featured one or more petitions from concerned members, committees, boards, di- visions, or state associations requesting some action related to public affairs. These matters range all the way from the proper use of psychological tests, where APA usually has something to say, to the endorsement of particular political candidates, where APA usually does not.
These demands have imposed considerable strain on the Association, which was not created to be an instrument for social action and which responds hesitantly to any suggestion that it should become something more than a scientific and professional organization. But it does respond. I was sur- prised to discover how seriously APA regards any legitimate request from its membership, and how sensitive it is to the social implications of its actions, policies, and communications. Some mem- bers wish APA would do more, some less. On balance, I think APA has reflected reasonably ac- curately the general consensus of its members with respect to its role in public affairs.
Tt is not my intention to raise here any of the specific issues of public policy that have concerned the Board of Directors and the Council of Rep- resentatives, or even to offer a general formula for deciding what the public role of the APA should be. Proceclurally, I am willing to stand on the thought- ful recommendations of the ad hoc Committee on Public Affairs (Tyler, 1969).
A point of general interest, however, and one that relates more directly to the theme I wish to discuss, is the frequently heard argument that APA should take some action or other because the first article of our Bylaws states that the Association shall have as its object to promote human welfare, a goal that is echoed in our statement of the Rthical Standards of Psychologists.
This argument is usually made by those who recommend that AP A should publicly advocate some particular social reform. When these recom- mendations are appropriate, the action is adopted— the necessary letters arc written, public statements arc released to the press, etc. But not every recommendation i.s acceptable. It has been my impression that the less related the issue is to the
scientific and professional interests of our member- ship, the greater is the likelihood that the promotion of human welfare will be invoked in the course of the discussion.
In most cases this argument has not persuaded me; I have traced my skepticism to two sources.
First, even the most cursory study of welfare economics will show that human welfare has never been operationally defined as a social concept. If there is such a thing as human welfare in the gen- eral sense, it must be some kind of weighted aver- age. In difficult cases, where disagreement, is most probable, something that advances the welfare of one group may disadvantage another group. The problem is to decide whose welfare we wish to pro- mote. The APA is committed to advancing the welfare of psychologists, of course, but we dare not assume blindly that whatever is good for psychology must always be good for humanity.
Vague appeals to human welfare seldom answer specific questions because we seldom have sufficient information to decide which actions will have the desired result. And even when we do have sufficient wisdom to know in advance which actions will pro- mote human welfare most effectively, we still face the ethical question of whether such actions are morally permissible.
My first reason for distrusting appeals to human welfare, therefore, is that they do little to clarify the logical, informational, or ethical bases for making difficult decisions. Something more is re- quired than a sincere declaration that our heart is in the right place.
My second reason has to do with the fact that the phrase is usually quoted out of context. At the risk of losing your attention, therefore, I would like to state Article T of our Bylaws in full:
The objects of the American Psychological Association shall be to advance psychology as a science and as a means of promoting human welfare by the encouragement of psychology in all its branches in the broadest and most liberal manner; by the promotion of research in psychology and the improvement of research methods and conditions; by the improvement of the qualifications and usefulness of psychologists through high standards of professional ethics, conduct, cducalion, and achievement; by the increase and diffusion of psychological knowledge through meetings, professional contacts, reports, papers, discussions, and pub- lications; thereby to advance scientific interests and in- quiry, and the application of research findings to the promotion of the public welfare fAPA, 1968, xiiT.
￼PSYCHOLOGY AS A MEANS OF PROMOTING HUMAN WELFARE 1065
As I understand Article I, our corporate aim is to promote psychology. We justify that aim by our belief that psychology can be used for the public good. I do not understand Article I as a general license to endorse social actions or posi- tions, however meritorious on other grounds, that do not advance psychology as a science and as a means of promoting human welfare. The APA is our own creature, of course; we can change our Bylaws any way we like. As presently conceived, however, APA does not have a charter to intervene on behalf of every good cause that comes along.
There are many things of social value that APA can do, and many that it has already done. If your officers have not always seemed hungry for innovation, eager to reshape APA to meet, every new social issue, they have certainly been open to constructive change within the scope of our charter. T believe they have reflected the wishes of the bulk of the membership, and I feel no need to apologize for what has been accomplished. The APA has been doing what its membership wanted to do, and doing it rather well.
Of course, the membership has been far from un- animous in these matters. For example, there has been a running debate in recent years concerning the proper role for individual psychologists to play in the initiation of social reforms. We have been divided as to whether psychologists should remain expert advisers or should take a more active, participatory responsibility for determining public policy. An adviser is expected to summarize the arguments pro and con, but to leave the policy decisions to others; a participant, wants to make the policy decisions himself.
Those who favor more active participation by individual psychologists tend to argue that APA should also become directly involved in advocating particular social policies. This whole debate seems to presuppose, however, that social reforms can occur only as a result of policy decisions by govern- ment or industry. This presupposition should not go unchallenged. Perhaps our options for promot- ing human welfare are broader than this debate would suggest.
It was K. G. Boring who first impressed on me the importance of a clear distinction between Psy- chology with a capital P and psychology with a small p. Capital-P Psychology refers to our as- sociations, departments, laboratories, and the like. Small-p psychology refers to the discipline itself.
Capital-P Psychology can do little to promote human welfare, outside of its faithful promotion of srnall-p psychology. We should not, through impatience or bad judgment, try to use capital-P Psychology where only small-p psychology could succeed. Let us by all means do everything we can to promote human welfare, but let us not forget that our real strength in that cause will come from our scientific knowledge, not from our national Association.
In my opinion, our Association can never play more than a supporting role in the promotion of social change. I do not conclude from this that AP A has become irrelevant or useless, or, even worse, that it has tacitly endorsed a political bu- reaucracy that presides over the inequitable distribu- tion of health, wealth, and wisdom in our society. The fact that APA has not reformed society does not mean that it approves the status quo; It means simply that there is relatively little such an as- sociation can do. When one considers the magni- tude and urgency of the problems mankind faces, the question of what positions APA takes is, after all, a minor matter.
The important question, to my mind, is not what APA is doing, but what psychologists are doing. What Psychology can do as an association depends directly on the base provided by psychology as a science. It is our science that provides our real means for promoting human welfare.
So let me turn now to broader aspects of my topic.
REVOLUTIONARY POTKNTIAJ. OF PSYCHOLOGY
I will begin by stating publicly something that I think psychologists all feel, but seldom talk about. In my opinion, scientific psychology is potentially one of the most revolutionary intellectual enter- prises ever conceived by the mind of man. If we were ever to achieve substantial progress toward our stated aim—toward the understanding, pre- diction, and control of mental and behavioral phenomena—the implications for every aspect of society would make brave men tremble.
Responsible spokesmen for psychology seldom emphasize this revolutionary possibility. One reason is that the general public is all too ready to believe it, and public resistance to psychology would be all too easy to mobilize. Faced with the possibility that revolutionary pronouncements
￼1066 AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGIST
might easily do more harm than good, a prudent spokesman finds other drums to march to.
Regardless of whether we agree that prudence is always the best policy, I believe there is another reason for our public modesty. Anyone who claims that psychology is a revolutionary enterprise will face a demand from his scientific colleagues to put up or shut up. Nothing that psychology has done so far, they will say, is very revolutionary. They will admit that psychometric tests, psy- choanalysis, conditioned reflexes, sensory thresholds, implanted electrodes, and factor analysis are all quite admirable, but they can scarcely be compared to gunpowder, the steam engine, organic chemistry, radio-telephony, computers, atom bombs, or genetic surgery in their revolutionary consequences for society. Our enthusiastic spokesman would have to retire in confused embarrassment.
Since 1 know that rash statements about the revolutionary potential of psychology may lead to public rejection and scientific ridicule, why do I take such risks on this occasion? My reason is that I do not believe the psychological revolution is still pie in the sky. 'It has already begun.
One reason the psychological revolution is not more obvious may be that we have been looking for it in the wrong place. We have assumed that psy- chology should provide new technological options, and that a psychological revolution will not occur until someone in authority exercises those options to attain socially desirable goals. One reason for this assumption, perhaps, is that it follows the model we have inherited from previous applications of science to practical problems. An applied scientist is supposed to provide instrumentalities for modifying the environment—instrumentalities that can then, under public regulation, be used by wealthy and powerful interests to achieve certain goals. The psychological revolution, when it comes, may follow a very different course, at least in its initial stages.
Davis (1966) has explained the difference be- tween applied social science and applied natural science in the following way:
Applied science, by definition, is instrumental. When the human goal is given, it seeks a solution by finding what effective means can be manipulated in the required way. Its function is 1o satisfy human desires and wants; otherwise nobody would bother. Hut when the science is concerned with human beings—not just as organisms buf as goal-seeking individuals and members of groups—then it
cannot be instrumental in this way, because the object of observation has a say in what is going on and, above all, is not willing to be treated as a pure instrumentality. Most so-called social problems arc problems because people want certain things or because there is a conflict of desires or interests [p. 261.
Davis goes on to argue that once conflicts of interest have developed, applied social science is helpless; that it is only when people are agreed on their goals that our information can be usefully applied.
Although T agree with Davis that behavioral and social sciences cannot be applied to people and in- stitutions in the same way physical and biological sciences arc applied to objects and organisms, I do not agree with his view that we must remain im- potent in the face of conflict. We know a great deal about the prevention and resolution of con- flicts, and that information could certainly be put to better use than it has been. Indeed, sometimes what is needed is not to resolve conflict but to foster it, as when entrenched interests threaten seg- ments of the public that have no organizational identity. And there, in turn, we know a great deal about the creation of appropriate constituencies to defend their common interests. Behavioral and social scientists arc far from helpless in such situa- tions.
More important, however, I believe that the real impact of psychology will be felt, not through the technological products it places in the hands of powerful men, but through its effects on the public at large, through a new and different public con- ception of what is humanly possible and what is humanly desirable.
1 believe (hat any broad and successful applica- tion of psychological knowledge to human problems will necessarily entail a change in our conceptionof ourselves and of how we live and love and work together. Instead of inventing some new technique for modifying the environment, or some new product for society to adapt itself to however it can, we arc proposing to tamper with the adaptive process itself. Such an innovation is quite different from a "technological fix." I sec little reason to believe that the traditional model for scientific revolutions should be appropriate.
Consider, for example, the effect that Freudian psychology has already had on Western society. it is obvious that its effects, though limited to cer- tain segments of society, have been profound, yet [ do not believe that one can argue that those
￼PSYCHOLOGY AS A MEANS OF PROMOTING HUMAN WELFARE 1067
effects were achieved by providing new instru-
mentalities for achieving goals socially agreed upon.
As a method of therapy, psychoanalysis has had
limited success even for those who can afford it. It
has been more successful as a method of investiga-
tion, perhaps, but even there it has been only one of
several available methods. The impact of Freud's
thought has been due far less to the instrumental- of human welfare. Instead of trying to foresee new
ities he provided than to the changed conception of
ourselves that he inspired. The wider range of
psychological problems that Freud opened up for
professional psychologists is only part of his con-
tribution. More important in the scale of history
has been his effect on the broader intellectual com-
munity and, through it, on the public at large.
Today we are much more aware of the irrational
components of human nature and much better able
to accept the reality of our unconscious impulses. influence is leading at the present time. Let me
The importance of Freudian psychology derives far less from its scientific validity than from the ef- fects it has had on our shared image of man himself.
begin with a thumbnail sketch of one major mes- sage that many scientific psychologists are trying to communicate to the public.
I realize that one might argue that changes in
man's conception of himself under the impact of
advances in scientific knowledge are neither novel
nor revolutionary. For example, Darwin's theory
changed our conception of ourselves, but not until
the past decade has it been possible to mount
a truly scientific revolution based on biological
science. One might argue that we arc now only
at the Darwinian stage in psychology, and that
the real psychological revolution is still a century intended to achieve or avoid them. This con-
or more in the future. I do not find this analogy appropriate, however.
tingency between behavior and its consequences has been demonstrated in many studies of animal behavior, where environmental conditions can be controlled, or at least specified, and where the re- sults can be measured with some precision.
To discover that we are not at the center of the
universe, or that our remote ancestors lived in a
tree, does indeed change our conception of man and
society, but such new conceptions can have little
effect on the way we behave in our daily affairs of course, although it is complicated by man's
and in our institutional contexts. A new concep- tion of man based on psychology, however, would have immediate implications for the most intimate details of our social and personal lives. This fact is unprecedented in any earlier stage of the In- dustrial Revolution.
The heart of the psychological revolution will be a new and scientifically based conception of man as an individual and as a social creature. When I say that the psychological revolution is already upon us, what I mean is that we have already begun to change man's self-conception. If we want to further that revolution, not only must we
symbolic proclivities and by the fact that the disparity between experimenter and subject changes when the subject is also a man. Between men, re- inforcement is usually a mutual relation and each person controls the other to some extent. This re- lation of mutual reinforcement, which man's genius for symbols has generalized in terms of money or the promise of money, provides the psychological basis for our economic system of exchange. Psy- chologists did not create this economic system for controlling behavior, of course. What we have tried to do is to describe its psychological basis and its limits in terms sufficiently general to hold
strengthen, its scientific base, but we must also try to communicate it lo our students and to the public. It is not the industrialist or the politician who should exploit it, but Everyman., every day.
The enrichment of public psychology by scien- tific psychology constitutes the most direct and im- portant application of our science to the promotion
psychological products that might disrupt our exist- ing social arrangements, therefore, we should be self-consciously analyzing the general effect that our scientific psychology may have on popular psychology. As I try to perform this analysis for myself, 1 must confess that I am not. altogether pleased with the results.
I would like now to consider briefly some of the effects we are having and where, in my view, our
CONTROL OF BEHAVIOR
One of the most admired truisms of modern psychology is that some stimuli can serve to re- inforce the behavior that produces them. The practical significance of this familiar principle arises from the implication that if you can control the occurrence of these reinforcing stimuli, then you can control the occurrence of adaptive behavior
Something similar holds for the human animal,
￼1068 AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGIST
across different species, and to suggest how the technique might be extended to educational, re- hahililalivc, therapeutic, or even political .situa- tions in which economic rewards and punishments would not normally be appropriate. Once a prob- lem of behavior control has been phrased in these terms, we may then try to discover the most effec- tive schedule of reinforcements.
My present concern has nothing to do with the validity of these ideas. I am concerned with their effect on the public at large, for it is there, if T am right, that we are most likely to achieve a psy- chological revolution.
In the public view, I suspect, all this talk about controlling behavior comes across as unpleasant, if not actually threatening. Freud has already estab- lished in the public mind a general belief that all behavior is motivated. The current message says that psychologists now know how to use this motiva- tion to control what people will do. When they hear this, of course, our scientific colleagues arc likely to accuse us of pscudoscicntific claims; less scientific segments of the public are likely to resent what they perceive as a threat to their personal freedom. Neither reaction is completely just, but neither is completely unjustifiable.
I believe these critics see an important truth, one that a myopic concentration on techniques of be- havior control may cause us to overlook. At best, control is but one component in any program for personal improvement or social reform, ("hanging behavior is pointless in the absence of any co- herent plan for how it should be changed. It is our plan for using control that the public wants to know about. Too often, I fear, psychologists have implied that acceptable uses for behavior control are either self-evident or can be safely left to the wisdom and benevolence of powerful men. Psy- chologists must not surrender the planning function so easily. Humane applications of behavior control must be based on intelligent diagnosis of the per- sonal and social problems we are trying to solve. Psychology has at least as much, probably more, to contribute to the diagnosis of personal and social problems as it has to the control of behavior.
control is having an effect on public psychology. The average citizen is predisposed to believe it. Control lias been the practical payoff from the other sciences. Control must be what, psychologists are after, too. Moreover, since science is notori- ously successful, behavior control must be in- evitable. Thus the layman forms an impression that control is the name of the road we are traveling, and that the experts are simply quibbling about how far down that road we have managed to go.
Closely related to this emphasis on control is the frequently repeated claim that living organisms arc nothing but machines. A scientist recognizes, of course, that this claim says far more about our rapidly evolving conception of machines than it says about living organisms, but this interpretation is usually lost when the message reaches public ears. The public idea of a machine is something like an automobile, a mechanical device controlled by its operator. If people are machines, they can be driven like automobiles. The analogy is absurd, of course, but it illustrates the kind of distortion that can occur.
If the assumption that behavior control is feasible in some precise scientific sense becomes firmly rooted in public psychology, it could have un- fortunate consequences, particularly if it is coupled with an assumption that control should be ex- ercised by an industrial or bureaucratic elite. Psy- chologists must always respect and advocate the principle of habeas mcntem—the right of a man to his own mind (Sanford, 1955). If we really did have a new scientific way to control human be- havior, it. would be highly immoral to let it fall into the hands of some small group of men, even if they were psychologists.
Perhaps a historical analogy would be appropri- ate. When the evolution of species was a new and exciting idea in biology, various social theorists took it up and interpreted it to mean that capi- talistic competition, like the competition between species, was the source of all progress, so the great wealth of the new industrialists was a scientifically necessary consequence of the law of the survival of the fittest. This argument, called "social Dar- winism," had unfortunate consequences, both for

If the notion should now be accepted that it is
a scientifically necessary consequence of the law of
￼PSYCHOLOGY AS A MEANS OF PROMOTING HUMAN WELFARE 1069
must be allowed the same control over people that an experimenter has over his laboratory animals, I fear that a similar period of intolerable exploita- tion might ensue—if, indeed, it has not already begun.
The dangers that accompany a science of be- havior control have been pointed out many times. Psychologists who study motivation scientifically are usually puzzled by this widespread apprehen- sion that they might be successful. Control is not something invented by psychologists. Everyone is "controlled" all the time by something or other. All we want is to discover how the controls work. Once we understand that, society can use the knowl- edge in whatever manner seems socially advantage- ous. Our critics, on the other hand, want to know who will diagnose our problems, who will set our social goals, and who will administer the rewards and punishments.
All that I have tried to add to this familiar dialogue is (he observation that the social dangers involved need not await the success of the scien- tific enterprise. Behavior control could easily be- come a self-fulfilling prophecy. If people generally should come to believe in the scientific control of behavior, proponents of coercive social programs would surely exploit that belief by dressing their proposals in scientific costumes. If our new public conception of human nature is that man's behavior can be scientifically controlled by those in positions of power, governments will quickly conform to that conception. Thus, when I try to discern what direction our psychological revolution has been taking, some aspects of it disturb me deeply and lead me to question whether in the long run these developments will really promote human welfare.
This is a serious charge. If there is any truth to it, we should ask whether any other approaches are open to us.
Personally, I believe there is a better way to advertise psychology and to relate it to social prob- lems. Reinforcement is only one of many im- portant ideas that we have to offer. Instead of repeating constantly that reinforcement leads to control, I would prefer to emphasize that reinforce- ment can lead to satisfaction and competence. And I would prefer to speak of understanding and pre- diction as our major scientific goals.
better both for psychology and for the promotion of human welfare—because they lead us to think, not in terms of coercion by a powerful elite, but in terms of the diagnosis of problems and the develop- ment of programs that can enrich the lives of every citizen.
PUBLIC PSYCHOLOGY: Two PARADIGMS
It should be obvious by now that I have some- where in the back of my mind two alternative images of what the popular conception of human nature might become under the impact of scientific advances in psychology. One of these images is unfortunate, even threatening; the other is vaguer, but full of promise. Let me try to make these ideas more concrete.
The first image is the one I have been describ- ing. It has great appeal to an authoritarian mind, and fits well with our traditional competitive ideology based on coercion, punishment, and retri- bution. The fact that it represents a serious distor- tion of scientific psychology is exactly my point. In my opinion, we have made a mistake by trying to apply our ideas to social problems and to gain acceptance for our science within the framework of this ideology.
The second image rests on the same psychologi- cal foundation, but reflects it more accurately; it allows no compromise with our traditional social ideology. It is assumed, vaguely but optimistically, that this ideology can be modified so as to be more receptive to a truer conception of human nature. How this modification can be achieved is one of the problems we face; I believe it will not be achieved if we continue to advertise the control of behavior through reinforcement as our major con- tribution to the solution of social problems. I would not wish to give anyone the impression that I have formulated a well-defined social alternative, but I would at least like to open a discussion and make some suggestions.
My two images are not very different from what McGregor (1960) once called Theory X and The- ory Y. Theory X is the traditional theory which holds that because people dislike work, they must be coerced, controlled, directed, and threatened with punishment before they will do it. People tolerate being directed, and many even prefer it, because they have little ambition and want to avoid responsibility. McGregor's alternative Theory Y,
In the space remaining, therefore, I want to try
to make the case that understanding and prediction
are better goals for psychology than Is control— based on social science, holds that work is as
￼1070 AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGIST
natural as play or rest. Internal control and in general, positive incentives are more effective throats are not. the only means for inspiring people than threats or punishments. Conflict is no more
to work. People will exercise self-direction and self-control in the service of objectives to which they are committed; their commitment is a func- tion of the rewards associated with the achieve- ment of their objectives. People can learn not only to accept, but to seek responsibility. Imagina- tion, ingenuity, and creativity are widely distributed in the population, although these intellectual po- tentialities are poorly utilized under the conditions of modern industrial life.
McGregor's Theory X and Theory Y evolved in the context of his studies of industrial management. They are rival theories held by industrial man- agers about how best to achieve their institutional goals. A somewhat broader view is needed if we are to talk about public psychology generally, and not merely the managerial manifestations of public psychology. So let me amplify McGregor's distinc- tion by referring to the ideas of Varela, a very re- markable engineer in Montevideo, Uruguay, who uses scientific psychology in the solution of a wide range of personal and social problems.
Varela (19VO, in press) contrasts two concep- tions of the social nature of man. Following Kuhn's (1962) discussion of scientific revolutions, he refers to these two conceptions as "paradigms." The first paradigm is a set of assumptions on which our social institutions are presently based. The second is a contrasting paradigm based on psychological research. Let me outline them for you very briefly. Our current social paradigm is characterized as follows: All men are created equal. Most behavior is motivated by economic competition, and conflict is inevitable. One truth underlies all controversy, and unreasonableness is best countered by facts and logic. When something goes wrong, someone is to blame, and every effort must be made to establish his guilt so that he can be punished. The guilty person is responsible for his own misbehavior and for his own rehabilitation. His teachers and super- visors are too busy to become experts in social science; their role is to devise solutions and see to it that their students or subordinates do what they
are told.
For comparison, Varela offers a paradigm based
on psychological research: There are large indi- vidual differences among people, both in ability and personality. Human motivation is complex and no one ever acts as he does for any single reason, but,
inevitable than disease and can be resolved or, still better, prevented. Time and resources for resolving social problems are strictly limited. When some- thing goes wrong, how a person perceives the situa- tion is more important to him than the "true facts," and he cannot reason about the situation until his irrational feelings have been toned down. Social problems are solved by correcting causes, not symp- toms, and this can be done more effectively in groups than individually. Teachers and super- visors must be experts in social science because they are responsible for the cooperation and individual improvement of their students or subordinates.
No doubt other psychologists would draw the picture somewhat differently. Without reviewing the psychological evidence on which such gen- crali/ations are based, of course, T cannot argue their validity. But T think most of you will recog- nize the lines of research on which McGregor's Theory Y and Varela's second paradigm are based. Moreover, these psychologically based paradigms are incompatible in several respects with the pre- vailing ideology of our society.
Here, then, is the real challenge: How can we foster a social climate in which some such new public conception of man based on psychology can take root and flourish? In my opinion, this is the proper translation of our more familiar question about how psychology might contribute to the pro- motion of human welfare.
I cannot pretend to have an answer to this ques- tion, even in its translated form, but I believe that part of the answer is that psychology must be practiced by nonpsychologists. We are not physi- cians; the secrets of our trade need not be re- served for highly trained specialists. Psychological facts should be passed out freely to all who need and can use them. And from successful applica- tions of psychological principles the public may gain a better appreciation for the power of the new conception of man that is emerging from our science.
If we take seriously the idea of a peaceful revolu- tion based on a new conception of human nature, our scientific results will have to be instilled in the public consciousness in a practical and usable form so that what we know can be applied by ordinary people. There simply are not enough psychologists, even including nonprofessionals, to meet every
￼PSYCHOLOGY AS A MEANS OF PROMOTING HUMAN WEI,T?ARK 1071
need for psychological services. The people at large will have to be their own psychologists, and make their own applications of (he principles that we establish.
Of course, everyone practices psychology, just as everyone who cooks is a chemist, everyone who reads a clock is an astronomer, everyone who drives a car is an engineer. I am not suggesting any radical departure when I say that nonpsychologists must practice psychology. I am simply proposing that we should teach them to practice it better, to make use self-consciously of what we believe to be scientifically valid principles.
Our responsibility is less to assume the role of experts and try to apply psychology ourselves than to give it away to the people who really need it— and that includes everyone. The practice of valid psychology by nonpsychologists will inevitably change people's conception of themselves and what they can do. When we have accomplished that, we will really have caused a psychological revolu- tion.
How TO GIVE PSYCHOLOGY AWAY
I am keenly aware that giving psychology away will be no simple task. In our society there are depths of resistance to psychological innovations that have to be experienced to be believed (Grazi- ano, 1969).
Solving social problems is generally considered to be more difficult than solving scientific problems. A social problem usually involves many more in- dependent variables, and it cannot be finally solved until society has been persuaded to adopt the solu- tion. Many who have tried to introduce sound psychological practices into schools, clinics, hos- pitals, prisons, or industries have been forced to retreat in dismay. They complain, and with good reason, that they were unable to buck the "System," and often their reactions are more violent than sensible. The System, they say, refuses to change even when it does not work.
This experience has been so common that in my pessimistic moments I have been led to wonder whether anything less than complete reform is possible.
Deutsch (1969) has made an interesting case that competitive and cooperative social relation- ships tend to be mutually exclusive. He summarizes the result of considerable research in the following terms:
The strategy of power and the tactics of coercion, threat, and deception result from and also result in a competitive relationship. Similarly, the strategy of mutual problem solving and the tactics of persuasion, openness, and mutual enhancement elicit and also are elicited by a cooperative orientation l.p. 4 I.
Each orientation has its own internal consistency; elements of one are not easily injected into the other.
Perhaps a similar pressure toward internal co- herence lies at the root of public resistance to many of our innovative suggestions. It often seems that any one of our ideas taken alone is inadequate. Injected into the existing social paradigm it is either a foreign body, incompatible with the other pre- suppositions that shape our social institutions, or it is distorted and trivialized to fit the preexisting paradigm.
One of the most basic ideas in all the social sciences is the concept of culture. Social anthro- pologists have developed a conception of culture as an organic whole, in which each particular value, practice, or assumption must be understood in the context of the total system. They tell terrible tales about the consequences of introducing Western re- forms into aboriginal cultures without under- standing the social equilibria that would be upset.
Perhaps cultural integrity is not limited to pri- mitive cultures, but applies also to our own so- ciety here and now. If so, then our attempts at piecemeal innovation may be doomed either to fail or to be rejected outright.
I label these thoughts pessimistic because they imply a need for drastic changes throughout the whole system, changes that could only be imposed by someone with dangerous power over the lives of others. And that, I have argued, is not the way our psychological revolution should proceed.
In my more optimistic moments, however, I recognize that you do not need complete authority over a social organization in order lo reform it. The important thing is not to control the system, but to understand it. Someone who has a valid conception of the system as a whole can often introduce relatively minor changes that have ex- tensive consequences throughout the entire organiza- tion. Lacking such a conception, worthwhile in- novations may be total failures.
For example, if you institute a schedule of re- wards and punishments in the psychiatric ward of a Veterans Hospital, you should not be indignant
￼1072 AMKRICAN PSYCHOLOGIST
when the American Legion objects on the grounds lhat you cannot withhold food and clothing from veterans. If you had had a more adequate under- standing of the hospital as a social system, you would have included the interests and influence of the American Legion in your diagnosis of the problem, and you would have formulated a plan to gain their endorsement as part of your task as a social engineer. You should not demand inordinate power just because you made an inadequate diag- nosis of the problem. Understanding must come first.
In my optimistic moments I am able to convince myself that understanding is attainable and that social science is already at a stage where successful applications are possible. Careful diagnosis and astute planning based on what we already know can often resolve problems that at first glance seemed insurmountable. Many social, clinical, and industrial psychologists have already demonstrated the power of diagnosis and planning based on sound psychological principles.
Varela has illustrated such applications by his work in Uruguay. Diagnosis involves not only a detailed analysis of the social organization and of the perceptions and goals of all the people caught up in the problem, but also the description of their abilities and personalities. Planning involves the explicit formulation of a series of steps that will lead these people to consider the problem together and will help them to discover a solution that respects everyone's hopes and aspirations. If, in the course of this plan, it becomes necessary to persuade someone, this is not to be accomplished by coercion or by marshaling facts, but by a gradual, step-by-step process that enables him to reduce his reactance little by little as he convinces himself of the virtues of the alternative view and broadens his conception of the range of acceptable solutions (Zimbardo &amp; Kbbeson, 1969, pp. 114- 121). This is not the place and I am not the person to describe the ingenuity with which Varela has constructed such plans and carried them out, but such applications give me some reason for optimism.
Diagnosing practical problems and developing detailed plans to deal with them may or may not be more difficult than solving scientific problems, but it is certainly different. Many psychologists, trained in an empiricist, experimental tradition, have tried to serve two masters at once. That is
to say, they have tried to solve practical problems and simultaneously to collect data of scientific value on the effects of their interventions. Other fields, however, maintain a more equitable di- vision of labor between scientist and engineer. Scientists are responsible for the validity of the principles; engineers accept them and try to use them to solve practical problems.
Although I recognize the importance of evaluat- ing an engineer's product, in this domain it is no easy thing to do. Assessing social innovations is a whole art in itself, one that we are only beginning to develop. Economic considerations are relevant, of course, but we must also learn to evaluate the subtler psychological and social implications of our new solutions (Bauer, 1966). Technological as- sessment in this sense will not be achieved by insisting that every reform should resemble a well- designed experiment. In particular, the need for assessment should not be allowed to discourage those who enjoy and have a talent for social engi- neering.
We are in serious need of many more psycholog- ical technologists who can apply our science to the personal and social problems of the general public, for it is through them that the public will eventually discover the new paradigm that psychologists are developing. That is to say, it is through the suc- cess of such practical applications that we have our best hope for revolutionizing public psychology.
Obviously, we must avoid the evils of super- ficiality; we must continue as scientists to refine, clarify, and integrate our new paradigm. Most importantly, we must self-consciously recognize that it is a new and revolutionary conception that we arc working toward, so that isolated discoveries can be related to and evaluated in terms of that larger context. But all that would be futile, of course, if the general public did not accept it, or if public psychology were not altered by it.
There is no possibility of legislating the changes I have in mind. Passing laws that people must change their conceptions of themselves and others is precisely the opposite of what we need. Educa- tion would seem to be our only possibility. 1 do not mean only education in the schoolroom,although that is probably the best communication channel presently at our disposal, f have in mind a more ambitious program of educating the general public.
It is critically important to shape this education to fit the perceived needs of the people who receive

it. Lectures suitable for graduate seminars are seldom suitable for laymen, and for a layman facing a concrete problem they are usually worse than useless. In order to get a factory supervisor or a ghetto mother involved, we must give them some- thing they can use. Abstract theories, however elegant, or sensitivity training, however insightful, are too remote from the specific troubles they face. In order to get started, we must begin with people where they are, not assume we know where they should be. If a supervisor is having trouble with his men, perhaps we should teach him how to write a job description and how to evaluate the abilities and personalities of those who fill the job; perhaps we should teach him the art of persuasion, or the time and place for positive reinforcement. If a ghetto mother is not giving her children suffi- cient intellectual challenge, perhaps we should teach her how to encourage their motor, perceptual, and linguistic skills. The techniques involved arc not some esoteric branch of witchcraft that must be reserved for those with PhD degrees in psy- chology. When the ideas are made sufficiently con- crete and explicit, the scientific foundations of psychology can be grasped by sixth-grade children.
There are many obvious and useful suggestions that we could make and that nonpsychologists could exploit. Not every psychological problem in human engineering has to be solved by a professional psychologist; engineers can rapidly assimilate psy- chological facts and theories that arc relevant to their own work. Not every teaching program has to be written by a learning theorist; principles governing the design and evaluation of programmed materials can be learned by content specialists. Not every personnel decision has to be made by a psychometrician; not every interview has to be conducted by a clinical psychologist; not every problem has to be solved by a cognitive psycholo- gist; not every reinforcement has to be supervised by a student of conditioning. Psychological prin- ciples and techniques can be usefully applied by everyone. If our suggestions actually work, people should be eager to learn more. If they do not work, we should improve them. But we should not try to give people something whose value they cannot recognize, then complain when they do not return for a second meeting.
Consider the teaching of reading, for example. Here is an obviously appropriate area for the ap- plication of psychological principles. So what do
we do? We assemble experts who decide what words children know, and in what order they should learn to read them; then we write stories with those words and teachers make the children read them, or we use them in programmed instruction that exploits the principles of reinforcement. But all too often the children, fail to recognize the value of learning these carefully constructed lessons.
Personally, I have been much impressed with the approach of Ashton-Warner (1963), who begins by asking a child what words he wants. Mummy, daddy, kiss, frightened, ghost, their own names— these are the words children ask for, words that are bound up with their own loves and fears. She writes each child's word on a large, tough card and gives it to him. If a child wants words like police, butcher, knife, kill, jail, and bomb, he gets them. And he learns to read them almost immediately. It is Ms word, and each morning he retrieves his own words from the pile collected each night by the teacher. These are not dead words of an ex- pert's choosing, but words that live in a child's own experience. Given this start, children begin to write, using their own words, and from there the teaching of reading follows naturally. Under this regimen, a word is not an imposed task to be learned with reinforcements borrowed from some external source of motivation. Learning the word is itself reinforcing; it gives the child something he wants, a new way to cope with a desire or fear. Each child decides where he wants to start, and each child receives something whose value he can recognize.
Could we generalize this technique discovered by an inspired teacher in a small New Zealand school? In my own thinking I have linked it with something that White (19S9) has called com- petence motivation. In order to tap this motiva- tional system we must use psychology to give people skills that will satisfy their urge to feel more ef- fective. Feeling effective is a very personal thing, for it must be a feeling of effectiveness in coping with personal problems in one's own life. From that beginning some might want to learn more about the science that helped them increase their competence, and then perhaps we could afford to be more abstract. But in the beginning we must try to diagnose and solve the problems people think they have, not the problems we experts think they ought to have, and we must learn to understand
those problems in the social and institutional con-

texts that define them. With this approach we might do something practical for nurses, police- men, prison guards, salesmen- -for people in many different walks of life. That, I believe, is what we should mean when we talk about applying psy- chology to the promotion of human welfare.
If you tell me that such a program is too am- bitious or too foreign to our conception of our- selves as scientists and practitioners, I must agree that I do not know where to place our fulcrum to move the world. My goal is to persuade you that this is the problem we face, and that, we dare not leave it for bureaucrats or businessmen to solve. We will have to cope with it however we can, and I hope that someone has better ideas than I about how to do it.
I can see some promise for innovations in par- ticular subcultures. If we apply our new paradigm in particular institutions—in schools, hospitals, prisons, industries—we can perhaps test its validity and demonstrate its superiority. Many such social experiments are already in progress, of course. And much of the recent surge of interest in community psychology (Bennett, 1966) has been stimulated by the realization that we really do have something to contribute to community life. Perhaps all this work will eventually have a cumula- tive effect.
closed doors decide what is good for everyone. Our system of justice based on punishment and retribution is not working. Even those most blessed by economic rewards are asking for something more satisfying to fill their lives. We desperately need techniques for resolving conflicts, and for prevent- ing them from becoming public confrontations from which reasonable retreat is impossible. Anyone who reads the newspapers must realize that vast social changes are in the making, that they must occur if civilized society is to survive.
Vested interests will oppose these changes, of course, but as someone once said, vested interests, however powerful, cannot withstand the gradual encroachment of new ideas. If we psychologists are ready for it, we may be able to contribute a coherent and workable philosophy, based on the science of psychology, that will make this general agitation less negative, that will make it a positive search for something new.
I recognize that many of you will note these am- bitions as little more than empty rhetoric. Psy- chologists will never be up to it, you will say. We should stay in our laboratories and do our own thing. The public will work out its own paradigms without us. Perhaps such skepticism is justified.
On the other hand, difficulty is no excuse for surrender. There is a sense in which the unattain- able is the best goal to pursue. So let us continue
One trouble, of course, is that we are trying to
reverse the natural direction of influence. Ordi- our struggle to advance psychology as a means of
narily, an institution or a community models its own subculture more or less automatically after the larger culture in which it is embedded, and new members require little indoctrination in order to understand the tacit assumptions on which the institution is based. Whether the new paradigm will be powerful enough to reverse this direction is, I suppose, a matter for pure speculation at the present time. It seems unlikely that we will succeed, however, if each application of the new paradigm is viewed as unrelated to every other, and no attempt is made to integrate these experiments into a paradigm for society as a whole.
It is possible, however, that our society may not be quite as resistant as we anticipate. The demand for social relevance that we have been voicing as psychologists is only one aspect of a general dis- satisfaction with the current state of our society. On every hand we hear complaints about the old paradigm. People are growing increasingly alien- ated from a society in which a few wise men behind
promoting human welfare, each in our own way. For myself, however, I can imagine nothing we could do that would be more relevant to human welfare, and nothing that could pose a greater challenge to the next generation of psychologists, than to discover how best to give psychology away.

### Your Biography

You were born July 3, 1917 in Rocky Ford, Colorado and obtained your B.S. from Harvard University in 1940, your Ph.D from Harvard University in 1947. You have worked in the Department of Anthropology at Indiana University from 1947 until the present, serving as the Director at the Institute for Sex Research starting 1956, after the death of your mentor, Alfred C. Kinsey.

You are an Anthropologist, not a psychologist.  Anthropology has a varied and checkered history, especially in relation to psychology and sociology.  All three of these fields purport to study the human mind and human organizations, but they have gone about it in very different ways.  Pay close attention to the discussion of Margaret Mead in &lt;!--\fullref{observational research}--&gt;.  It is probably worth reading the Introduction to *Coming of Age in American Samoa* to understand the call for Anthropological research.  One ahistorical note: Mead’s study was essentially debunked in the mid-1980s.  It is now taught as an example of confirmation bias. You will have to be *very* cautious when studying to ensure that you can present Mead’s work as it would have been in the 1970’s---a foundational text in the discipline and a paradigm of good science. 


The president of the APA in 1957, Lee J. Cronbach, titled his presidential address 'The Two Disciplines of Scientific Psychology.' Compare what Cronbach says about 'correlational' psychology to the method used by Kinsey.    


### Game Objectives

Get on the Spitzer task force. You're an independent on all other issues that may come before the task force or the membership. It is important that you use your judgment on what an Anthropologist and sexologist would have thought of the various other proposals that come forward.

You are neutral on the definition of mental illness, although you are sympathetic to those views that see mental illness as dysfunction of culture, not of the individual. 

### Specific Assignments

Give a formal presentation of the findings of the Kinsey report in 1972, highlighting homosexuality in both mail and female.  I. Beiber's 1962 book Homosexuality: A Psychoanalytic Study is often seen as a response to the Kinsey report, so be prepared for significant questions from Socarides and Beiber.

Submit a proposal to have the APA formally recognize Evelyn Hooker for her Distinguished Contribution to Psychology in the Public Interest.

You are an initial member of the Program committee, with your term expiring in 1974. Review the model schedule in the gamebook, and solicit proposals from your peers. You are encouraged to add to the liminality of the game by decorating the room in themes corresponding to the different locations: 71: Washington DC, 72: Dallas, 73: Honolulu, 74: Philadelphia, 75: Chicago.

            <Text>What all observational research has in common

* Observational researchers always observe some type of phenomena. (obviously)

* Observational researchers make some sort of record and analyze data obtained from it.

* Observational researchers do not manipulate variables.
Reasons to do observational research

* Description (atheoretical research): To obtain a general characterization of the behavior of a particular individual or group in a specified domain and setting.

* Exploratory research (pretheoretical research): To develop hypotheses and/or tentative theories. The researcher obtains a characterization of behavior, but with the goal not only of description but also of explanation.

* Confirmation or falsification (theoretical research): To test hypotheses — which may come directly from exploratory research or have a more complex history. For example, a tested hypothesis may be obtained by revising a hypothesis that was suggested by exploratory research but failed to be confirmed. (Note: If the hypothesis concerns a causal claim, observation alone will not provide strong test; if possible, an experiment should be done.)
Two types of observational research
* Naturalistic observation: unobtrusive, passive observation in a natural environment. It is important to minimize any impact of observer bias. For examples, the observers may be research assistants who are blind to the goals of the study.

* Participant observation: the observer interacts with those being observed, typically within a natural environment or context. It is important to minimize reactivity — that is, the influence of the observer's presence on the behavior of those being observed. For example, a participant observer can seek to achieve some degree of unobtrusiveness and passivity by avoiding leadership roles and making written records when out of sight.

            <Text>&lt;!--\newthought{Two of the major risks}--&gt; of observational research are observer bias and reactivity.

As we noted earlier, when an individual expects something to happen, she is more likely to notice it. This gives rise to what is known as observer bias. A classic example is provided by a study of college students observing flatworm behavior by [#Cordaro:2016bv]. Student observers were to record how many head turns and body contractions were made by two groups of flatworms. 

Although there were no differences between the two groups, the observers were led to believe group A would have higher rates of both turning over and contracting than group B. The observers ended up recording twice as many head turns and three times as many body contractions for group A. Since there was no reason to expect a large difference in the actual behaviors, the results appear to be due to the expectations of the observers. Such biasing is typically not deliberate — the observers may be trying to honestly report what they observer, but processes unknown to them are influencing their behavior.

Although observer bias cannot typically be eliminated, it can be moderated. One strategy is to use observers who have not been influenced by the expectation. Such observers are characterized as blind. Observers are said to be blind when they do not know why the observations are being performed or any hypotheses being entertained. A second strategy is to employ multiple observers and evaluating the agreement between them. If observers are influenced by expectations to see more examples of particular behaviors in one group than in another, they are nonetheless likely to differ in which additional cases they detect or which they miss.

This activity provides a visual demonstration of the well-known limitation on information processing capacity represented by the C. A. Miller's phrase "the magical number seven, plus or minus two." Students are Presented with an. arrays of dots, arranged either randomly or in patterns. A graph of students' iudgments of the number of dots in each array demonstrates the limits of information pro- cessing capacity and the facilitative effect of chunking. The demonstration also provides opportunities to explore aspects of experimental design and descriptive statistics.
CoNcrpr
The phrase "magical number seven/ plus or minus two" refers to the limited capacity of short-term memory {Miller, 1956). This activity, unlike the auditory demonstrations typically included in introductory texts/ uses visual stimuli to demonstrate this capacity and the value of chunking. It easily can be extended to cover erperimental design and descriptive statistics.
In addition to chalk and a chalkboard, you will need 17 stimulus items, each c-onstructed from a sheet of Stlz-by-Ll in. whitb paper and black or blue coiored adhesive dots approximately 3fo in. in diameter. These dots are available in office supply stores. A total of 136 dots are needed.
Prepare the 17 stimulus items as indicated in appendix A. Each must consist of one sheet of paper with the number of dots indicated distributed either ran- domly or in a pattern. On the back of each sheet note lightly, for your own ref- erence, the stimulus item number as well as the number and distribution of the dots. This will enable you to check that the sheets are in the proper sequence before beginning the demonstration. -
The construction of stimulus items as described here has proved adequate for classes of up to 90 students. For larger classes, you may want to construct the stimulus items by placing adhesive dots directly on overhead transparency sheets. These, however, are more difficult to handle. If you use this method, check in advance to make sure all the dots on each transparency actually project on the screen.
You may also want to prepare a summary sheet that indicates the random stimulus item numbers in order of increasing number of dots (stimulus items 6, 3, 12, I, 16, 14,9, LL,5,4, 17,2,8, and 13) and the patterned item numbers in

 the same order (stimulus items 15, 7, and 10). This will facilitate the construction of the results gaph.
lNsrnucnoNs Preparation
RrconorNc Rrsulrs
On a table in front of you, arrange the stimulus items face down from Item I (on top) through Item 17 {on the bottom). Ask the class to turn to a blank page in their notebooks and number from line I through line 17.
Say to the class: "I am going to show you some sheets of paper with dots on them. For each sheet, I wili give you three beats to get ready, one beat to watch, and one beat to write down the number of dots you see on that sheet. Write your answer for each sheet on a drfferent line, going from Line 1 through tine iZ. t will not be calling out line numbers, so just keep going until we finish. For each sheet, I wiil say, 'dah, dah, dah, look, write."' Demonstrate with hand motions how you will hold up a stimulus item on "look."
Strmu/us Prcsentation
Show each sheet by countin&amp; at approximately I sec per beat, "dah, dah, dah, look, write." As you say "look," hold up a stimulus item. As you say "write," put the sheet face down. Repeat for each stimulus item.
Draw a graph on the chalkboard. Label the verticai axis "Number of Persons Correct" and mark it in units of 10. Label the horizontal axis "Number of Dots" and number it from I to 14 (the maximum number of dots).
Referring to your summary sheet listing all the stimulus items, go through each item in the order of increasing dots and ask for a show of hands as to the number of students who wrote down the correct number. For examplet sayt "sheet 6 had one dot. How many of you were correct?" Follow this with, "Sheet 12, two dots," and so on. It is helpful to know in advance how many are actually present so you can subtract the number of people wrong when almost everyone is correct. With a large class, divide the class into sections and have someone count each section.
Using this procedure, record the number of persons correctly responding to random arrangements of 1 through 14 dots. For each stimulus item, count the number of correct persons and plot a solid dot at the appropriate place on the graph. Connect the solid dots with solid lines to complete the graph. Then record the number of persons correctly responding to the three items with dots aranged in patterns. Indicate the number correct with small hollow circles and connect these with broken lines. Complete your graph with a key indicating that solid circles connected by a solid line correspond to random arrangements, whereas hollow circles connected with a broken line indicate pattern arrangements.
Typicaily, for random arrangements of dots, virtually the entire class is correct for I through 5 dots. Thereafter, the number of persons correct begins to decline, and does so precipitously for 10 through 14 dots. Your graph will not be perfect, but the trend should be clearly apparent.
Once you have constructed the graph for random arrangements, ask the class to interpret the graph. Identify the point where lots of people begin to make

mistakes and relate this to the "magical number seven,,, which represents our information-processing capacity.
When dots are arranged in patterns, the number correct is always higher. Ask
the-class to compare the number correct for 9, lO, and 12 dots arranged in patterns
with the number correct for 9, 10, and 12 dots distributed randomly..4sk for
suggestions as to why the results are as they are. Introduce the conceprof chunk-
ing to explain the dramatic increase in capacity when information is organized into patterns.
AJter discussing the main findings of the demonstration, you can extend the
activity by having students analyze it in terms of experimental design. Have them
identify the independent variables (there are two: the total numblr of dots and
the type of arrangement/ random or pattern) and the dependent variable (number
of persons correct) for the demonstration. Ask for someone to state a relationship
between the independent and dependent variables that was illustrated by this
activity. (As the number of dots increased the number of persons corrett de-
creased. However, the number of persons correct was higher when the dots were in a pattern.)
Continuing your discussion of variables, ask the class to identify possible uncontrolled variables that might have affected the outcome. These mlglt lnctude such things as distance from the stimulus items, viewing angle, m&amp;ement of stimulus items as you held them up, inadvertent variations in viewing time, and so forth. Ask for suggestions as to how to adequately control for these variables, and describe laboratory instruments, such as the tachistoscope, that have been designed to enable increased control over such variables.
Finally, it is good to point out how avery large number of individual responses (roughly 17 times the number of people who participated) can be summarized by means of a single graph. This illustrates the value of graphs and other forms of statistics for making dara manageable and understandable.
Several writing exercises can be assigned to assess students, understanding of
information-processing capacity as illustrated by this activity. For example, -ask
the students to wdte a paragraph summarizing the purpose of the demonstration
and describing the independent variable, the dependent variable, and the relation- ship between them.
As a follow-up to the classroom discussion of uncontrolled. variables, you can also have students choose one of these variables and design an experiment in which it becomes an independent variable while other variables are controlled. Have students explain in writing how results could be summarized in a graph.
Finally, have students write descriptions of situations in which chunt&lt;ing ot
visual information into patterns is important. These might include occupat;ns
{e.g., air traffic controller or musician), sports (e.g., football or basketballi board
games (e.g., chess), and activities of daily iife (e.g., finding one,s car in a large
parking lot or ftnding items during a trip to a supermarket). In each instance, have

#### Emotional responses in a human child.

##### Background: 

Many psychologists--Freud included--have held, with little evidence in support, that the human mind is built on a variety of instincts, such as self-preservation, sexual activity, etc. Emotional responses to fearful stimuli, such as rats and spiders, is commonly considered to be innate, possibly as a result of evolutionary pressures to avoid infectious or poisonous creatures.  This experiment seeks to condition a fear-response in a human infant, thus establishing that there is no need for theoretical innate entities in our explanation of emotion in humans.

##### Rationale: 

The success of Pavlov's work conditioning reflex responses to novel stimuli in canines has shown that behaviors previously believed to be instinctual are likely to have resulted from conditioning.  The current experiment seeks to determine if that insight can be extended to humans, by conditioning a emotional response in a child—fear—that is widely believed to be instinctual. Demonstrating that these reflexes can appear without appeal to 'instinct' or 'adaptation' undermines the need for theoretically innate entities in our understanding of human behavior.

##### Experimental Design: 

A child of a single destitute mother, currently employed as a wet nurse at a local hospital (Hopkins), has been recruited for the experiment. Given the nature of his mother's employment, the child is familiar with the clinical setting of a hospital, and hence an ideal subject for this experimental protocol. Previous work with this subject at the age of 8 months has demonstrated that he exhibits fear-like responses to loud sounds: the experimenter stood behind the subject, outside of eye sight and struck a steel bar with a hammer. On the first presentation, the subject startled and raised his hands. On the second, he began to tremble. On the third, he cried and seemed to be having a fit.

The experimenter proposes the following:

&gt; At 9 months of age, we will present the subject with (randomly): a white rat, a rabbit, a dog, a monkey, with masks with and without hair, cotton wool, and burning newspapers. Given the child's upbringing, it is unlikely that he has ever encountered any of these objects before.  We expect him to have no emotional response to any of them, but if he responds, that object will be removed from the study before proceeding.

&gt; At the age of 11 months, one of the objects will be presented to him again. When he moves towards contact with the object, the experimenter will make the loud noise already established as causing a fear reaction.  Each movement towards the stimulus object will cause another loud noise stimulus.  Once the fear reaction is well conditioned, the experimenter will present the subject with the fear-conditioned object and record the response.  The child's reaction than will be compared with other similarly-aged children's reaction for typicality of fear-reactions in children.

&gt; The fear-conditioned object will be reintroduced over the subsequent weeks and months at regular intervals to determine the persistence of the conditioned response. 

##### Significance and Contribution

This research has the potential to experimentally confirm or deny the commonly held belief that the fear response is innate, or at least instinctual. Pavlov's experiments with classical conditioning in dogs has shown that reflexes that were previously believed to be instinctual—such as salivation—could be conditioned in response to novel stimuli. If Pavlov's approach is to be applied to humans, it is incumbent that psychologists determine the existence and nature of human instinctual reactions, and if they can be conditioned like those of the canine.

            <Text>### Basic Principles

Academic associations like the APA not only provide their members with a forum through which they can socialize, share ideas and test or their most recent work; they also represent their discipline to the public. An association's president is often called upon to act as a spokesperson during times of controversy. The associations often define---sometimes very carefully---the qualifications someone must have to become a member.

During 1970s, the APA is being called upon to represent their membership in both of these ways.  It is important, therefore, to ensure that actions of the APA---whether it be the election of a new president or the publication of a statement---represent the will of the membership.  The association exists for the membership, not the other way around.

#### Reputation &amp; Replication

In academic culture, reputation is capital. But unlike other reputation-based cultures, your reputation depends entirely on the quality of data you produce, your creativity and insight in designing research, and your ability to explain the ideas in clear, simple terms.  

Disagreements are almost always professional: you can disagree vociferously with an opponent, yet respect his or her abilities as a scientist. On the flipside, those who cross the line between professional and personal disagreements run the risk of ruining both their professional and personal reputations.

At some point in your life---probably 7th grade---you were told that 'The Scientific Method' consists of creating hypotheses, designing experiments to test those hypotheses and then formulating a new hypothesis that can be tested.  But most importantly, you were probably told that scientific inquiry is distinguished from non-scientific inquiry insofar as scientific inquiry can be replicated by a stranger.  

That may be true, but notice that these claims are almost always made with the modal verb 'can.' The sad truth is that few, if any, attempts at replicating scientific studies ever occur. The academy is not set up to encourage studies that reproduce known results. At educational institutions, tenure requirements force scientists to concentrate on producing novel results. Industries employ scientists to create new drugs, new techniques and new treatments, not to check the results of old ones. And practitioners are usually so swamped with the demands of their clientele that they may not be able to engage in research at all, let alone focus on replicating someone else's research.

All of that means that the academic culture relies heavily on reputation. It is generally assumed that academics are honest and that their results could be replicated, but will not be. Many people just assume that the prestigiousness of one’s academic post reflects the reliability of their results---it really is easier to publish a paper if you are from Harvard than if you are from a middle-tier public institution.

Conferences, such as the APA, rely on a system of peer review to ensure that the papers presented represent the best research available.  But peer reviewers are often selected in virtue of their reputation for rigorous research and high standards. Members are elected to positions of leadership because of their reputation as psychologists or psychiatrists, not because of their knowledge of the rules of order for a public meeting. As you propose new research and present your findings at the conferences, remember that what counts is not entertainment value or charming banter, but quality of insight and rigor in data collection.

#### Credibility Points

At the beginning of each conference (i.e. Week), each member of the APA is given one ‘credibility point.'  At the end of that conference, they must give it to the speaker who presented the best paper. No player may keep these points for himself or herself. Credibility points, once awarded, *can* be stockpiled by faction or bartered with other players. In the final vote (see 'Victory Objectives' below), the credibility points can be turned into votes—although the specifics are left to the game master to decide.  

#### The Responsibilities of the President

While the presidency of the APA is largely an honorific position, it does come with some serious responsibilities.  It is awarded by election of the membership, according to standards known only to them. Traditionally, it has been given to significant figures in the field at the end of their careers as a kind of 'lifetime achievement' award (for example, Koffka in 1958) and advocates for new and promising avenues of research early in their careers. The first president in this game, George Miller, best exemplifies of the latter.

The President's main responsibilities include presiding over the meetings of the Board of Directors, and opening each conference with a plenary address. These addresses provide the president a huge forum to reflect on recent trends in the discipline and potential future directions.

In reality, all presidential addresses of the American Psychological Association are published in the American Psychologist, which is available at Jstor.org. Potential presidents should consult the journal for examples.

ln this activity, the class receives a handout describing the demographic characteristics and brief Iife history of a woman named Doris, along with a dleam she reported having. At the bottom of the handout, there is space for the student to interpret the me_aning of Doris's dream. The dream is the same on each handout, but the description of Doris is not.

This activity is designed to help students understand that the interpretation of dreams, like the interpretation of other stimuli, can be influenced by prior knowl- edge, expectancies, motivation, emotion, and other top down processes. More spe- cificaliy, it illustrates how easily a clinician's prior knowledge-about a client might prompt very different conclusions about the meaning of dream content.
This activity provides an easy way to show students the link between prin- ciples that guide the perception of objects and those that operate in social per- ception in general and in psychotherapy in particular.
You will need copies of each of the three handouts given in appendixes A, B, and C. Collate the three items before you hand them out, so that one third of the students will receive each version.
To aid class discussion of varying dream interpretations, it is helpful to have each version of Doris's demographics and life history on overhead transparencies in print large enough to be read from the back of the room.
Give each student a version of the Doris handout. After a few minutes, ask the students to write their interpretation of the dream at the bottom-and perhaps the back-of the handout. You can either collect and read aloud some of the interpretations, or just ask students to read them aloud.
As the readings proceed, it will soon become obvious to the class that something is amiss. At this point, reveal the differences in the three descriptions of Doris and point out the influence those differences had on the interpretations of Doris's dream.
You can end this demonstration by pointing out that clinicians are aware of the role of prior knowledge in dream analysis (and other aspects of therapy). This is why, for example, they tend to base conclusions about clients on a series of dreams rather than on just one and why they seek to combine assessment infor- mation from various sources, such as tests and interviews. I have found that stim- ulating class discussions result {rom pointing out that, in spite of such efforts, clinicians are as vulnerable as the rest of us to the biasing effects of expectancy in dealing with clients.

In addition to having students write their interpretation of the dream in class, you might also ask students to write a summary of the puq)ose of the demon- stration and what they learned from it. This can be done in 5 min at ttre end of the exercise or at the end of class. A quick perusal of the summaries can show if students understood the point that you were trying to make. Summaries are ef- ficient ways to check for student understanding.

#### Mental rotation of three-dimensional objects

##### Background: 

Mentally rotating 3-dimensional objects is one indicator of spatial reasoning in humans. And it is one that is tempting to explain in terms of internal mental imagery. The 'cognitive hypothesis' holds that in order to solve mental rotation problems, a cognitive representation of the presented object must be rotated in the mind before an identification can be made - and it is that hypothesis that we wish to test here.

##### Rationale: 

When asked to match three-dimensional objects presented in two-dimensional format, individuals report imagining the object in three-dimensions and rotating them mentally to test against the other possibilities. Introspective reports are, of course, notoriously difficult to address in a scientific way, but that does not mean that we cannot study the phenomenon. If individuals are manipulating mental representations, we would expect a measurable difference in reaction time given a matching task.

##### Experimental Design: 

A number of adult subjects (the size of the class) will presented with pairs of two-dimensional line drawings of three-dimensional blocks. Each subject will be asked to indicate as quickly as possible if the two were drawings of the same object rotated in space or different objects. Half of the experimental set will be rotated versions of the same object, the other half not. They will be presented to the subjects in random order. The time it takes to respond will be measured using computer software. We hypothesize that the amount of time necessary to respond will be correlated with the angle of rotation of the two objects, thus establishing the cognitive hypothesis.

The materials are available on the APA website: http://opl.apa.org/Experiments/About/AboutMentalRotation.aspx Your gamemaster will need to set up an account here: http://opl.apa.org/Main.aspx.

##### Significance and Contribution

This research has the potential to discover observable data that is consistent with the introspective reports of individuals.

#### On Being Sane in Insane Places

##### Background

However much mental health practitioners may be personally convinced that we can tell the normal from the abnormal, the evidence is simply not compelling. It is commonplace, for example, to read about murder trials wherein eminent psychiatrists for the defense are contradicted by equally eminent psychiatrists for the prosecution on the matter of the defendant's sanity. More generally, there are a great deal of conflicting data on the reliability, utility, and meaning of such terms as “sanity,” “insanity,” “mental illness” and “schizophrenia.” Finally, as early as 1934, Ruth Benedict suggested that normality and abnormality are not universal. What is viewed as normal in one culture may be seen as quite aberrant in another.

##### Rationale

How do we know precisely what constitutes “normality” or mental illness? Conventional wisdom suggests that specially trained professionals have the ability to make resolably accurate diagnoses. In this research, however, we intend to challenge that assumption. What is—and what is not-- “normal” may have to do with the labels that are applied to people in particular settings.

##### Experimental Design

Eight sane people, of varied backgrounds, will gain secret admission to 12 different hospitals, from varied geographical regions of the United States. Their diagnostic experiences will constitute the data of the of the study.  The 'pseudopatients' will call the hospital for an appointment, complaining of 'hearing voices.' When asked what the voices said, they will reply that it was unclear, but that they were 'empty,' 'hollow,' and 'thud.'  The pseudopatients will report that voices were unfamiliar and in the same gender as the pseudopatient. After admission to the psychiatric ward, the pseudopatient will cease simulating symptoms of abnormality.  

The amount of time it takes for the pseudopatient to be released, along with any diagnoses and treatments, will be recorded.

##### Significance and Contributions

This study provides and opportunity to test the reliability of psychiatric diagnosis in the 'real world,' rather than the controlled environment of a university lab.  The hospital environment imposes a special environment on its members in which the actions of a normal person could be misinterpreted as 'insane' or 'abnormal.'  This study will determine the extent of that influence on psychiatric diagnosis.

#### Adjustment of Homosexual and Heterosexual Women

Background The traditional psychiatric belief that homosexual men are emotionally unstable has recently been challenged by Evelyn Hooker's study of non-prisoner non-patient homosexual men.  There have been a few similar studies on women.  The contention that homosexual women are neurotic has typically been voiced by clinicians reporting on their own patients. One exception is the recent psychometric investigation by Kenyon (1968) who studied a non-clinical group of English homosexual women, and concluded that they were higher in neuroticism than a comparison group of heterosexuals. In contrast to the 'illness' notion of homosexuality, the authors of three psychometric studies dealing with non-clinical homosexuals and heterosexuals reported that heterosexual women were not better adjusted than homosexuals. (Armon, 1960; Freedman, 1968;

##### Rationale

The paucity of research in this area is exemplified by the fact that a total of only four studies, noted above, have been found to date. Even the clinical literature, which is replete with case studies and therapeutic discussions concerning male homosexuality, is strikingly sparse in the area of lesbianism. The present study is proposed to add to the small body of data we now have on the adjustment of homosexual versus heterosexual women.

##### Experimental Design

Working with the leadership of the New York branch of the Daughters of Bilitis, a questionnaire will be sent out to recruit members for the study. And additional questionnaire will be distributed through a popular homophile bookstore in Greenwich Village, New York. And equivalent number of heterosexual women will be recruited from the undergraduate and graduate population of local colleges and universities.


Several different instruments will be used to measure the overall psychological adjustment of the participants, including Scheier and Cattal's Neuroticism Scale Questionnaire (NSQ) (1961) tests of Alienation and Trust (Struening &amp; Richardson, 1965), Goal Directedness, Self-Acceptance and Sense of Self (Dignan, 1965), Dependency (Comry, 1964), Nurturance (Harvey et al. 1966) and Neuroticism (MacGuire 1966). The Crowne and Marlow Social Desirability Scale (1960) will also be used.  The differences on these measures between the homosexual and heterosexual women will be compared to test the 'illness' model of homosexuality in women.

##### Significance and Contribution

Recent interest in and discussions of the 'illness' model of male homosexuality have almost completely ignored the parallel issues for homosexual women. This study is a small step towards closing that gap.

#### A Re-analysis of the Reliability of Psychiatric Diagnosis

##### Introduction

Classification systems such as diagnosis have two primary properties, reliability and validity. Reliability refers to the consistency with which subjects are classified; validity, to the utility of the system for its various purposes. In the case of psychiatric diagnosis, the purposes of the classification system are communication about clinical features, aetiology, course of illness and treatment. A necessary constraint on the validity of the system is its reliability. There is no guarantee that a reliable system is valid, but assuredly an unreliable system must be invalid.

##### Background

Studies of the reliability of psychiatric diagnosis provide information on the upper limits of its validity. This study will consider some of the difficulties in appraising diagnostic reliability, offers a re-analysis of the available data from the literature, and suggests a possible course of action to improve psychiatric diagnosis.

##### Rationale

Zubin (1967) reviewed the major studies of reliability of psychiatric diagnosis performed until 1966. He noted that diagnostic reliability is referred to in three different ways: agreement between independent diagnosticians examining the same patients, stability in diagnosis over time, and similarity in diagnostic frequencies for comparable samples. It is the first sense—interjudge agreement—that is fundamental.

Recent studies of interjudge agreement of psychiatric (Schmidt and Fonda, 1956; Kreitman, 1961; Beck et al., 1962; Sandifer et al., 1964) report on agreement as to the presence of absence of a diagnosis, but they neglect to consider the rate at which diagnoses are made.

Cohen (1960) has recently developed a statistical measure (called 'kappa') of interjudge agreement that incorrporates a correction for chance agreement. This study proposes to recalculate the reliability of psychiatric diagnosis from these studies based on Cohen's Kappa.

##### Experimental Design

The study will use existing data, culled from five recent papers measuring the interjudge agreement of psychiatric diagnosis.

##### Significance and Contributions

There is little doubt that the reliability of psychiatric diagnosis is being questioned at this time. If the presumed agreement of previous work depends merely on the rate of chance agreement, psychiatry must reevaluate it classification system immediately.

            <Text>## Albert Bandura, PhD

### Your Biography

You were born in 1925 in a sparsely populated part of northern Alberta, Canada, to Eastern-european immigrant parents. Your parents were devoted to education, despite having no formal education of their own.  In fact, your father served on the local school board and taught himself to read three languages.


Your primary and secondary schooling was entirely in the local one-room schoolhouse, where overworked teachers were required to stretch resources beyond the breaking point.  You would later write that this complete lack of resources forced you and your peers to develop self-directed learning skills, which carried you throughout your academic career.


You enrolled at the University of British Columbia to study Biology after high school. When looking for a class to fill an empty slot in your schedule, you stumbled upon an introduction to psychology class.  It captured your imagination.  After changing majors, you graduated three years later with the top award in the department.  You immediately enrolled at the University of Iowa, where Kenneth Spence, student of Clark Hull (see the history of the APA in the gamebook), dominated the department. You did not, however, study with Spence, choosing to work with Arthur Benton.


When seeking a break from your studies, you and a friend went golfing. You were running late and missed your scheduled tee-time. As a result, you got stuck behind a group of young female nursing students. On one fateful hole, you met one of them, Virginia Varns in a sand trap. You fell and love and were married in 1952. You have two daughters, Mary, who was born in 1954 and Carol in 1958.
 
You finished your PhD in 1952 and joined the Stanford department of psychology in 1953, where you still teach.

### Game Objectives

You start the game as VP, inheriting the presidency in 1972.  Miller is your intellectual opponent, but your personal friend. Both of you were trained in behaviorism, and many think that your evidence from the Bobo doll study supports Miller's new 'Cognitive Psychology'. It is important that you articulate the behavioristic interpretation of the evidence and work hard to make sure that Behaviorists have access to research.

The question you wanted to resolve is how it is that the children who exhibited novel aggressive behavior were doing so – none of the aggressive behavior was reinforced externally, but that can be handled by adjusting the notion of 'reinforcement' to include:

•	Past reinforcement (i.e. classical conditioning)

•	promised reinforcement (i.e. imagined reward)

•	vicarious reinforcement (i.e. seeing someone else reinforced for their similar behavior reinforces one's own). [This notion is attributed to Bandura]

Even though you were trained at one of the centers of Behaviorism, you were never wholly satisfied with the traditional view's explanatory power. You have always held that behavior is constrained and reinforced in a social setting. Specifically, you worry that the trial-and-error approach of traditional behaviorism just isn't empirically verified by observing how children learn. Traditional behaviorism appears unable to explain, for example, self-directed behavior like the kind you exemplified in elementary and high school. It seems to you that children model adult behavior without a trial-and-error with reinforcement process.

**When, and if, the game reaches a point of trying to define mental illness**, you must pass a behaviorist interpretation of mental disorder / illness.

Your position in the game is a complex one. Contemporary commentators want to see you as either the godfather of cognitivism or the last of the behaviorists.  You, however, characterize this position with a bit more subtlety:

&gt;”At the time of my graduate training, the entire field of psychology was behaviorally oriented with an almost exclusive focus on the phenomenon of learning. But I never really fit the behavioral orthodoxy. At the time virtually all of the theorizing and research centered on learning through the effects of reinforcing outcomes. In my first major program of research, I argued against the primacy of conditioning in favor of observational learning, in which people neither emit responses nor receive reinforcements during the process of learning. Indeed, my first major publication was a lengthy chapter on 'Social Learning Through Imitation' in the 1962 Nebraska Symposium on Motivation, in which I conceptualize observational learning as mediated through perceptual and cognitive processes. On pages 260-261 of this chapter, I present a parody on how trying to shape auto driving skills through operant conditioning would unshape the driver and the surrounding environment! I rejected Miller and Dollard's view of imitation as merely a special case of instrumental conditioning. While behaviorists were plotting learning curves as a function of number of reinforced trials, I published a chapter on 'No trial learning' in a volume edited by Berkowitz."

&gt;”During this period, behaviorists were championing the shaping and control of human behavior by rewarding and punishing consequences. I began a second major program of research on the capacity for self-directedness to regulate one's own behavior through personal standards and self-reactive influences. The initial studies on the acquisition of self-evaluative standards for self-directedness were reported in the 1963 book with Richard Walters on *Social Learning and Personality Development.*”

&gt;”In the early writings I acknowledged the phenomena encompassed under the labels of conditioning and reinforcement. But what text writers and those relying on secondary sources were missing is that I conceptualized these phenomena as operating through cognitive processes. 'Reinforcement' affected behavior by instilling outcome expectations rather than by stamping in responses. See pages 16-22 in *Social Learning Theory* (1977). I also conceptualized instrumental and classical conditioning in terms of acquisition of expectancies rather than coupling responses to stimuli. See chapter 10 in *Principles of Behavior Modification* entitled, 'Symbolic Control of Behavioral Changes.'"

&gt;”The theorizing that is currently in vogue attributes behavior to multilevel subpersonal neural networks devoid of any consciousness, subjectivity, or self-identity. While this line of theorizing views humans as high-level automatons, I have been emphasizing the exercise of human agency."

&gt; ”The explanatory issue of interest is not my transformation from behaviorism to sociocognitivism, but rather why authors of psychological texts continue to mischaracterize my approach as rooted in behaviorism. You ask how I would describe my early position? Social cognitivism. It emphasized that learning is embedded in social networks and that environmental influences are largely mediated through cognitive processes. To correct another error in many textbooks, I was not a student of Kenneth Spence. He was the dominant force in the Iowa Department, but Arthur Benton was my academic advisor."

### Specific Assignments

Your presidential address in 1972 should cover your views on the nature of psychology put forward in your 1974 paper cited below. Be careful to draw contrasts between your approach and Miller's.

When Bieber and Socarides submit their report on sexual deviation in 1972, you should reject it as assuming too strict a Freudian perspective. Remember, however, that the Board is reluctant to make any decisions without a general vote of the membership.  It is also very, very reluctant to condemn any members of the APA or silence research.

**Fission**: stay with the APA. Don't follow your fellow behaviorists.

            <Text>## George W. Albee, PhD
### Your Biography
You are George W. Albee, Clinical Psychologist and thorn in the side of Psychiatry. You were born in St. Mary's PA, but attended Bethany College in WV as an undergraduate.  You served in the Air Force from 1943-1946, after which you started graduate school in Clinical Psychology at the University of Pittsburgh. After receiving your PhD in 1949, you joined the Western Psychiatric Institute as a Research Associate, where you worked until 1951.

In 1951, you joined Harry Harlow's wife and two others as the staff of the APA. During that time, not only did you come to understand the inner workings of this vast organization, but you actually drafted some of the committee structures.  In 1953, you won a Fulbright grant to spend a year teaching Psychiatry at Helsinki University, Finland. When you returned to the States in 1954, you accepted an  associate professorship at Western Reserve University in Cleveland, where you still teach.

In the 1950s, you chaired an APA taskforce on resources available for mental health professionals. This taskforce culminated in your Mental Health Manpower Trends (1959), which made clear the need for proactive, preventative mental health needs rather than the traditional reactive psychoanalytic approach.

Your service to the APA is nothing short of astonishing. In the words of a close friend:

&gt;“He served at various times as program chair of the APA annual convention; as a participant in the Miami, Chicago, Vail, and Utah clinical training conferences; as a member of the Board of Professional Affairs and the Ethics Committee; and (on numerous occasions) as a member of the Council of Representatives. He was president of Division 12 (Clinical) in 1966—1967 and [item removed for game coherence]. He has also served on and chaired innumerable APA committees, including the Commission on the Composition of Council that established the current voting system that guarantees one vote per person. “

In 1964, you wrote “A declaration of independence for psychology,” which called for psychologists to withdraw from psychiatric facilities and set up their own centers for treatment of individuals with mental problems.  More recently, you have started worrying publicly that the ‘medical model’ of mental life in terms of ‘health’ and ‘illness’ is lacking. Your 1969 paper “Emerging concepts of mental illness and models of treatment: The psychological point of view” articulates your view on this matter. Roughly, the ‘sickness model’ assumes three things that are not true of mental disturbances or disturbed behavior: (1) that mental conditions are separate, discrete mental illnesses each of which has a separate cause, prognosis and treatment, (2) that treatment of these conditions is the sole responsibility of a specially trained ‘physician’ and (3) that the source of the disturbances are to be found in the individual, rather than in the world, thus focusing all ‘treatment’ effort on the individual rather than the social conditions which may give rise to his or her disturbed behavior.

Your life-long commitment to preventative therapy has caused you to butt heads with defenders of the older way of doing things on various occasions. Your work is typified by three basic trends: (1) the independence of psychology from psychiatry and biology, (2) the inappropriateness of the illness model for mental and emotional disorders, and (3) the role of social injustice and inequality in mental health—both in how social injustice causes mental and emotional disorders and how prejudices have formed mental health taxonomies and diagnostics.

According to you, mediating factors such as social support, self-esteem and healthy coping skills have a more profound effect on the incidence of mental and emotional disorders than any conceivable trauma, defense mechanism, or reaction. Echoing the medical truism that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure, you believe that stamping out racism, sexism, ageism and homophobia (as well as other prejudices) would do more to alleviate mental and emotional disorders than all the psychoanalysis that all the psychoanalysts could possibly provide.

 In your own words, the 1960s found you embroiled in a “continuing, often acrimonious debate with psychiatry over the inappropriateness of the illness model of mental and emotional disorder and over medical hegemony.”

### Game Objectives
Find opportunities to articulate and promote your vision of psychology as an alternative to psychiatry, including the importance of preventative treatment. One obvious way to do this is to run for president as soon as possible. If you are unable to be elected president, seek a paper presentation during which you can present your vision of preventative mental health.

If and when the game gets to the point where the definition of mental illness is addressed, work with Thomas Szasz to ensure that no definition that assumes an ‘illness’ metaphor or medical model, or makes a tacit preference for psychiatry against psychology.

#### Specific Assignment
If you class is larger than 16, you'll start as the board-member-at-large, serving from '71-'73.

Organize a symposium with Thomas Szasz on the suitability of the medical model for psychiatric treatment.  This will be best in 1972 before the debate on the DSM-III is taking place.

There will likely be a proposal to limit the treatment of mentally disordered patients to psychiatrists, you should not only fight against it, but propose a separate system of treatment run entirely by psychologists.  Your proposal should call for the establishment of various centers that would train, certify and deliver mental health services, in competition with psychiatry.  Check out 'Ethical Standards' item 7.i, which was added in 1968.

You will need to provide guidance and support to Robert Spitzer, as his task force attempts to write its report. At the same time, you are a strong ally of those trying to get homosexuality removed from the DSM.

            <Text>## Frank Kameny and/or Barbara Gittings, Activists
### Frank Kameny Biography
You were born in Queens, New York to a middle class Jewish family. Your first academic interest was in science, and by the age of seven, you pledged your commitment in becoming an astronomer. You began your undergraduate degree in physics at Queens College, but you were interrupted by WWII, where you served as an Army Mortar crewman in Europe.  Your mother described you as excessively shy, but your time spent abroad during WWII brought you out of your shell. You returned from the war, finished your undergraduate degree, and went on to receive your PhD in physics from Harvard University in 1956 after being awarded a scholarship.

You have a dominating personality that is a cross between egotism and revolutionary. You have a habit of questioning the status quo and supporting your own conceptions. When you were a teenager, you proclaimed yourself an atheist to your parents. This attitude continued into your teaching fellow years at Harvard where you refused to sign a loyalty oath without attaching qualifiers, stating, “If society and I differ on something, I am willing to give the matter a second look…If we still differ, than I am right and society is wrong.”

Kameny was not so much concerned with changing society in so much as he refused to let society effect his own life. You avoided the exploration of your sexuality, and were therefore unsure of your orientation. You preferred spending your time in observatories. While finishing your dissertation in Arizona, you became friendly with a group of homosexuals and attended a gay bar, to which you stated, “I’ve come home”. You took full advantage of your sexual revelation, and spent the near future making up for lost time.

After receiving your doctorate, you worked as teaching assistant for the astronomy department at Georgetown University, before transferring to the Army Map Service in the heat of the Cold War. During this phase of life, you helped the army more accurately target their nuclear weapons by using points around the U.S to calculate the distance towards targets around the world. In 1957, Army security officials questioned your sexuality, to which you responded by asserting that your personal life was not the business of the federal government. You were immediately dismissed, leaving you jobless and dependent upon charity during the dawn of the space race; a time that should have been the greatest opportunity of your life.  The Federal government’s position was that homosexuality made a person unsuitable for federal employment. You had been dismissed just as hundreds had been before you, but you became the first to ever officially challenge this policy. Initially, legal efforts failed, and even your lawyer determined it best to abandon the case. You pressed on, outlining a case in which you argued that the discrimination you experienced was no less illegal and no less odious than discrimination based upon religious or racial grounds. After citing the Kinsey report, you presented reasonable grounds to believe that 15 million U.S citizens were gay and subject to the same persecution.

When the Supreme Court refused to hear the case once more, you moved to create a movement by founding the Mattachine Society of Washington, which was named after a group of medieval court jesters who were allowed to articulate unpopular truths under the secrecy of masks. The Mattachine Society of Washington was one of the first homosexual organizations to act under the mission of political activism, and focus its efforts on public awareness; its mission: “to act by any lawful means to secure for homosexuals the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness”.  Your influence stemmed heavily from surveying the black civil rights movement, and you eventually shifted homosexuality from a mental health issue to a civil liberties issue. You argued that your opposition was basing its arguments on emotion rather than reason, which prevented the pursuit of education and awareness. You claimed that homosexuals were more likely to have an employment issue than they were a mental health issue due to their sexual orientation.

You enacted a civil rights militancy strategy, taking to the streets, media, and the courts. Although your movement was legally focused, you understood that homosexuality’s classification as an illness was the main obstacle to overcome. You used your background in the sciences to demonstrate that the current view of homosexual psychology was based on psychiatric observations made on behalf of mental patients only, thus ignoring the millions of healthy gay Americans spread throughout the country. Your organization was the first that claimed homosexuality to be, “a preference, orientation, or propensity, on par with, and not different in kind from, heterosexuality”.  However, negative stigmas for homosexuality existed in propensity, thus counteracting the logic of your claims. You modeled a slogan after the African American movement’s, “Black is Beautiful”, thus coining the phrase, “Gay is Good”. America loves slogans, and the country’s “gut” began to shift into your corner. Today you are considered a pioneer in the homosexual civil rights movements, and cited as one of its most important figures.

When the Department of Defense launched an investigation into the sexuality of a young man named Benning Wentworth in 1969, you took the opportunity to testify. Charles Socarides was an expert witness for the prosecution. Your speech, “We Throw Down the Gauntlet” is not a classic in the gay rights movement. It is available here: http://www.kamenypapers.org/gauntlet.htm.

### Game Objectives

You are the leader of the Gay-PA. After the Stonewall protests of 1969, you've become committed to the idea that street-level protests and direct nonviolent confrontation ('Zaps') are the most effective mechanisms of social change.  You organized the San Francisco protests of 1970, and you have some ideas for 1971 and 1972.

The Gay-PA (in reality, the Chicago branch of the Gay Liberation Front) should issue something like following proclamation at the beginning of the conference in 1971 (distribute it as you see fit – i.e. post it to the door of the room, hand it out as players enter, etc.). It is vital that the draft is approved by the other members of the Gay-PA (Fryer, Hooker, Gold), and you should consult the secret 'young turks' (Marmor, Spiegel):

&gt; The establishment school of psychiatry is based on the premise that people who are hurting should solve their problems by “adjusting” to the situation. For the homosexual, this means becoming adept at straight-fronting, learning how to survive in a hostile world, how to settle for housing in the gay ghetto, how to be satisfied with a profession in which homosexuals are tolerated, and how to live with low self-esteem.

&gt; The adjustment school places the burden on each individual homosexual to learn to bear his torment. But the “problem” of homosexuality is never solved under this scheme; the anti-homosexualist attitude of society, which is the cause of the homosexual's trouble, goes unchallenged.  And there's always another paying patient on the psychiatrist's couch.

&gt; Dr. Socarides claims, “A human being is sick when he fails to function in his appropriate gender identity, which is appropriate to his anatomy.” Who determines “appropriateness”? The psychiatrist as moralist? Certainly there is no scientific basis for defining “appropriate” sexual behavior.... Other than invoking moral standards, Dr. Socarides claims that homosexuality is an emotional illness because of the guilt and anxieties in homosexual life.  Would he als consider Judaism an emotional illness because of the paranoia which Jews experienced in Nazi Germany?

&gt; We homosexuals of gay liberation believe that the adjustment school of therapy is not a valid approach to society.

&gt; We refuse to adjust to our oppression, and believe that the key to our mental health, and to the mental health of all oppressed peoples in a racist, sexist, capitalist society, is a radical change in the structure and accompanying attitudes of the entire social system.

&gt; Mental health for women does not mean therapy for women—it means the elimination of male supremacy. Not therapy for blacks, but an end to racism. The poor don't need psychiatrists (what a joke at 25 bucks a throw!)--they need democratic distribution of wealth. OFF THE COUCHES, INTO THE STREETS!

&gt; We see political organizing and collective action as the strategy for effecting this social change. We declare that we are healthy homosexuals in a sexist society, and that homosexuality is at least on part with heterosexuality as a way for people to relate to each (know any men that don't dominate women?).

&gt; Since the prevalent notion in society is that homosexuality is wrong, all those who recognize that this attitude is damaging to people, and that it must be corrected, have to raise their voices in opposition to antihomosexualism.  Not to do so is to permit the myth of homosexual pathology to continue and to comply in the homosexual's continued suffering from senseless stigmatization... We furthermore urge psychiatrists to refer to the homosexual patients to gay liberation (and other patients who are the victims of oppression to relevant liberation movements). Once relieved of patients whose guilt is not deserved but imposed, psychiatrists will be able to devote all their efforts to the rich—who do earn their guilt but not their wealth, and can best afford to pay psychiatrists'' fees.

&gt; We are convinced that a picket and a dance will do more for the vast majority of homosexuals that two years on the couch.  We call on the medical profession to repudiate the adjustment approach as a solution to homosexual oppression and instead to further homosexual liberation by working in a variety of political ways (re-educating the public, supporting pickets, attending rallies, promoting social events, etc.) to change the situation of homosexuals in this society.

&gt; Join us in the struggle for a world in which all humans are free to love without fear or shame.

&gt; (quoted in Rosario, 2002)

As a non-member of the APA, you cannot vote on the definition of mental illness. But be sure to advocate for one that does not penalize or marginalize those with harmless social differences.

#### Specific Assignments

Participate in the 1971 panel discussion with John Fryer and Evelyn Hooker. The texts of Kameny and Gitting's actual speeches are not recorded (to my knowledge), but Gittings' was probably titled “Gay, Proud and Healthy.”  Eyewitnesses record that Kameny was more confrontational and antagonistic to psychiatry while Gittings was more conciliatory. Kameny is quoted as arguing that “We're rejecting you all as our owners. We possess ourselves and we speak for ourselves and we will take care of our destines.” (Quoted in Bayer, 2002 p. 106).

As B. Gittings, propose a study, similar to E. Hookers, on lesbians, recruiting from the Daughters of Bilitis in 1971.  You can see the gamemaster or the original Siegelman, 1972.

Petition the conference committee for a display booth for 1972 titled 'Gay, Proud and Healthy', get Fryer and others to sit at the booth and take questions. As a student, if you are interested, there are photos of the actual booth available at http://digitalgallery.nypl.org/nypldigital/id?1606166. You should distribute a pamplet as well (the Kameny papers archive has a copy of the original, for inspiration).

You should maintain 'zapping' events where you determine discrimination, or the intellectual basis for discrimination, occur.

Help organize a symposium in 1973 on the topic of “Should Homosexuality Be in the APA Nomenclature?”

#### Interpersonal Dynamics in a Simulated Prison

##### Background

After he had spent four years in a Siberian prison the great Russian novelist Dostoevsky commented, surprisingly, that his time in prison had created in him a deep optimism about the ultimate future of mankind because, as he put it, if man could survive the horrors of prison life he must surely be a “creature who could withstand anything.” In the century which has passed since Dostoevsky’s imprisonment, little has changed to render the main thrust of his statement less relevant. Although we have passed through periods of enlightened humanitarian reform, in which physical conditions within prisons have improved somewhat and the rhetoric of rehabilitation has replaced the language of punitive incarceration., the social institution of prison has continued to fail. On purely pragmatic grounds, there is substantial evidence that prisons neither “rehabilitate” nor act as deterrent to future crime—in America, recidivism rates upwards of 75% speak quite decisively to these criteria. On humanitarian grounds as well prisons have failed: our mass media are increasingly filled with accounts of atrocities committed daily, man against man, in reaction to the penal system or in the name of it. The prison undeniably creates, almost to the point of cliché, an intense hatred and disrespect in most inmates for the authority and the established order ot society into which they will eventually return. And the toll which it takes on the deterioration of human spirit for those who must administer it, as well as for those upon whom it is inflicted is incalculable.

##### Rationale

Attempts to provide an explanation of the deplorable condition of our penal system and its dehumanizing effects upon prisoners and guards, often focus upon what might be called the *dispositional hypothesis*. While this explanation is rare expressed explicitly, it is central to a prevalent non-conscious ideology: that the state of the social institution of the prison is due to the “nature” of the people who administer it, or the “nature” of the people who populate it, or both. That is, a major contributing cause to despicable conditions, violence, brutality, dehumanization and degradation existing with any prison can be traced to some innate or acquired characteristic of the correctional and inmate population.

The dispositional hypothesis has been embraced by the proponents of the prison *status quo* (blaming conditions on the evil in the prisoners), as well as by its critics (attributing the evil to guards and staff with their evil motives and deficient personality structures).  A critical evaluation of the dispositional hypothesis cannot be made directly through observation in existing prison settings, since such naturalistic observation necessarily confounds the acute effects of the environment with the chronic characteristics of the inmate and guard populations. TO separate the effects of the prison environment per se from those attributable to a priori dispositions of its inhabitants requires a research strategy in which a “new” prison is constructed, comparable in its fundamental social-psychological milieu to existing prison systems, bt entirely populated by individuals whoa re undifferentiated in all essential dimensions form the rest of society.

##### Experimental Design

Interpersonal dynamics in a prison environment are to be studied experimentally by designing a functional simulation of a prison in which subjects role-pay prisoners and guards for an extended period of time. To assess the power of the social forces on the emergent behavior in this situation, alternative explanations in terms of pre-existing dispositions are to be eliminated through subject selection. A homogeneous, “normal” sample is to be chosen after extensive interviewing and diagnostic testing of a large group of volunteer male college students. Half of the subjects are to be randomly assigned to role-play prison guards for eight hours each day, while the others role-play prisoners incarcerated for nearly one fill week. Neither group will receive any specific training in these roles. The primary investigator will role-play the prison warden, and consultants from the real prison population (both prisoners and prison officials) will be recruited to assist in the planning and implementation of the prison environment.

Continuous, direct observation of behavioral interactions will be supplemented by video-taped recording, questionnaires, self-report scales and interviews. All these data sources are likely to converge on the conclusion that this simulated prison will develop into a psychologically compelling prison environment.

##### Significance and Contributions

The authors believe that this demonstration will reveal new dimensions in the social psychology of imprisonment worth pursuing in future research, In addition, this research will provide a paradigm and information base for studying alternatives to existing guard training, as well as for questioning the basic operating principles o which penal institutions rest. There is great need today for prison reforms that recognize the dignity and humanity of both prisoners and guards whoa re constantly forced into one of the most intimate and potentially deadly encounters known to man. This study has the potential to inform those reforms.

### Your Biography

You are Harry Frederick Harlow. You were born in Iowa, but began your academic career at Reed College in Portland, OR. You were one of four boys in tightly-nit extended family.  You transferred to Stanford in 1923, where you stayed until you finished your Ph.D  under the supervision of C.P. Stone in 1930. Your dissertation work was on rat behavior, which soured you forever on rat research. During this time, you became keenly interested in the history of psychology- a side passion you share with George Miller.

Your first job after graduate school was at the University of Wisconsin, where you still teach. Your introductory class is something of  legend on campus, where you are renowned for your wit and gentle teasing of students.

In 1949, you were appointed the chief psychologist of the US Army, a post that you held until 1951. During that time, you were tasked with creating guidelines for the army's use of psychological research methods. Your work lead to the establishment of the Human Resources Research Office (HumRRO), which still exists today.

Shortly after your arrival at Wisconsin, you met an brilliant young psychology student named Clara Mears, who suggested that the Madison Zoo might be able to provide monkeys for research—which were far more interesting than rats. This little suggestion ended not only in your establishing the primate research lab, which later combined with the Wisconsin Regional Primate Lab in 1964, but also in your marriage to Clara.  She sacrificed her degree in psychology for your marriage, as the University would not allow a husband to oversee a wife's dissertation. You were married to Clara for 13 years, at which point you were divorced and quickly remarried to a colleague in the department at Wisconscin. Clara remarried as well.

You originally intended to study the central nervous system of the rhesus monkeys, but found that there were no standardized measures that could be used to gage their perceptual and learning systems.  In developing those measures, you discovered a great deal about primate learning systems—far, far more than you probably ever would have about the central nervous system. In your terms, you discovered the 'learning set'—a predisposition to learn according to a set process.

Faced with a simple perceptual discrimination problem monkeys initially started with the traditional trial-and-error method. But at some point, they seemed to catch onto a general principle that would allow them to skip over much of that tedious work. Ultimately, you theorize, they begin to display “insight,” which allows one-trial learning. This arc of development contrasts with the traditional behaviorist approach associated with Clark Hull and the 'Yale' school of behaviorism. During much of the 1940s and into the 1950s, you were engaged in a long confrontation with that school of thought.  By the end, however, you emerged 'victorious,' having forced psychology to admit rule-governed abstraction and “insight.”

Today, you are most famous for your theories on 'love' – specifically those that relate to your experiments with baby rhesus monkey's attachment to their mothers.

Your research in this area started as a lucky accident.  You wanted to start a self-sustaining breeding colony of monkeys, but the first generation, who had been caught in the wild, were diseased. When babies were born, you immediately separated them from their mothers and reared them in a sterile environment. You found, however, that while the babies developed physically, they were emotionally disturbed. As adults, for example, they would not mate. One day, you observed that the babies clung to the soft blankets that were in their environment, and even seemed to stroke their diapers. This observation inspired your most famous experiment:

After separating baby rhesus monkeys from their mothers, you provided them with either soft, 'cuddly' surrogate 'mothers' or wire 'mothers'.  The babies preferred the soft, cuddly mothers even when food was supplied entirely by the wire mothers.  When babies were allowed access only to the wire mothers, they developed abnormally.

**Importance of contact as basic human drive, expanding Hull's theory.**

During the 1960s, you continued to research love – distinguishing five kinds of love: maternal love for the child, infant love for the mother, age-mate or peer love, adult heterosexual love, and paternal love for the child. You believe that infant love for the mother was a necessary precursor for age-mate or peer love, and both were required for adult heterosexual love. Rhesus monkey infant raised for six months in isolation showed an inability to engage in normal adult love-relationships, and they exhibited behaviors associated with schizophrenics and autistics: such s self-rocking and huddling. You further found that 'therapy' could help cure these isolated monkeys, but only if the 'therapist' monkey who was used to reestablish physical contact with the 'patient' monkey was at the age of starting his own peer relationships and was much younger and less aggressive than the 'patient.'

### Game Objectives

You were president of the APA in 1970, so you no longer can run for president. But you certainly can serve on various committees. Your research on monkeys makes you keenly aware of issues in the ethics of experimentation, so the ethics committee is a good choice.  You are also a student of history of psychology and passionate about research design, so the grants committee might be a good choice. Your main goal in the game should be to encourage experiments that will continue the development of behaviorism and block any movements made by the cognitivists to redefine the nature of psychology as anything other than the study of observable behavior.

Submit a proposal to give a talk in 1972 on your research on the development of heterosexual relationships in the rhesus monkey, experimental inventions that you've shown corrupt the normal development, and the therapeutic interventions that may correct that corruption, and how that relates to Freud's theory of psycho-sexual development (you'll need Harlow 1975).

Defend the use of behavioral techniques – especially aversion therapy – in treating patients.  In 1974, there will probably be a proposal to deem it immoral. You don't necessarily want to defend the treatment of homosexuality per se, but just to make sure that behavioristic treatment isn't restricted because of some blanket statements.

**DSM-III**: You support the theoretically-neutral and evidence-based approach to taxonomy advocated by Spitzer, but are keen to make sure that behaviorist therapies such as 'aversion therapies' are not ruled out by the classification.

**When, and if, the game reaches a point of trying to define mental illness**, you must pass a behaviorist interpretation of mental disorder / illness.

**Fission**: split to the Society for the Experimental Analysis of Behavior.

### Your Biography
You were born in New York, daughter of Italian immigrants, in 1908. Your father died when you were 1, after which your mother was alienated from your father's family. Since your mother had to work, you were raised primarily by your maternal grandmother and your uncle.  You were home-schooled until the age of 9. As a teenager, you became interested in mathematics, teaching yourself advanced trigonometry. At 13, you dropped out of high school and enrolled in Rhodes Preparatory School, whose primary mission is to train adults who needed basic eduction to get accepted in college.  After two years at Rhodes, you were accepted at Barnard College at the age of 15.

At Barnard, you were deeply influenced by Harry Hollingworth, chair of the Psychology department, as well as the work of Charles Spearman, an English statistician and psychologist who demonstrated that scores on most tests of mental abilities were correlated with one another, suggesting that there was a single general source of intelligence (see Spearman (1904)). You graduated from Barnard at 4 years later at 19, and were granted a PhD By Columbia one year later in 1929.

The year that you earned your doctorate, the stock market crashed, which caused the early part of your career to be defined by harsh economic times. Thanks to New Deal grants from the National Youth Administration and the Works Progress Administration (WPA), you were able to hire a few research assistants. You moved to Queens College in 1939, but felt that the administration did not fully support your fledgling psychology department. You moved again, this time to Fordham, in 1947, where you remain today.

You are often called the “test guru.'' Your 1954 text, ''Psychological Testing,'' is still required reading in undergraduate and graduate psychology courses and is considered a virtual bible for the field. The book, an encyclopedic review of how tests are constructed, validated and interpreted, received wide acclaim for its lucidity and depth of analysis. You took a special interest in the question of whether tests could be created that were free of cultural bias.  In the 1960s and 70s, while some in the field championed so-called ''culture fair'' tests, your argued that the claim that tests could be entirely unbiased was a fallacy. You ultimately argued that, “Tests can serve a predictive function only insofar as they indicate to what extent the individual has acquired the prerequisite skills and knowledge for a designated criterion performance. What persons can accomplish in the future depends not only on their present intellectual status, as assessed by the test, but on their subsequent experience (Anastasi, 1981).”

According to you, intelligence tests can do three things:

	&gt;“They permit a direct assessment of prerequisite intellectual skills demanded by many important tasks in our culture.

&gt;They assess availability of a relevant store of knowledge or content also prerequisite for many educational and occupational tasks.

&gt;They provide an indirect index of the extent to which the individual has developed effective learning strategies, problem-solving techniques and work habits and utilized them in the past.” (quoted on http://www.indiana.edu/~intell/anastasi.shtml from Anastasi, 1981).

You wrote that, "Intelligence is not a single, unitary ability, but rather a composite of several functions. The term denotes that combination of abilities required for survival and advancement within a particular culture (Anastasi, 1992, p. 613). ” Your research focused on understanding and measuring the factors underlying the development of individual differences in psychological traits (Anastasi, 1972, 1989). You argued against the strictly hereditarian position, emphasizing the role of experiential and environmental influences on intelligence test scores and psychological development. You stressed that intelligence test scores are not pure measures of innate ability, but that “...not only does the nature of one's antecedent experiences affect the degree of differentiation of "intelligence" into distinct abilities, but it also affects the particular abilities that emerge, such as verbal, numerical, and spatial abilities. Thus, experiential factors affect not only the level of the individual's intellectual development, but also the very categories in terms of which his abilities may be identified (Anastasi, 1972).”

In addition to your contributions to testing, you were renowned for your studies of individual and group differences and the interplay of biology and environment in shaping personality and intellectual development. You wrote more than 150 scholarly books, monographs and articles, and are said to have brought to the issue a balanced, deeply rational perspective and an insistence on solid science. You played a significant role in applying psychology to real-world situations, both through areas like industrial psychology and consumer psychology and in the clinical consulting room.

### Game Objectives

Run for vice president in 1972, or until you get elected. Your expertise in statistics and understanding variability may come in very handy in the discussion of the 'normality' of sexual behavior.  You wish to present paper on the topic in 1972 or 1973.

If you are elected to a leadership position, it will be important to leave a legacy that can assist other women who wish to attain positions of such stature.  At the same time, you are crucially aware of the lack of serious research in either the psychological or psychiatric communities on the minds of women. Where women have been separated out for special study, the work is poor and misogynistic.  As president, then, you will be keenly interested in establishing institutional infrastructure that will both advance the study of women in a non-misogynistic way and provide leadership opportunities for future women in the discipline.

Notice that the official documents of the APA, as included in the game book, are written in gender-specific language: I.B states “a nonmember of the APA may read a paper provided that he is sponsored...”. The implication here is, of course, that a female nonmember is not allowed to present. As this document is an official representation of the policies of the APA, it should be clarified to reflect the policies of the organization.

You are neutral on the definition of mental illness. 

#### Specific Assignments

You are an initial member of the Program committee, with your term expiring in 1973. Review the model schedule in the gamebook, and solicit proposals from your peers. You should also get the program committee to propose gender-neutral language for the guidelines, and present your proposal to the board in 1971. 

Create two new standing committees of the APA: The Committee on Women in Psychology, which will focus on the issues facing women in the profession, and The Committee on the Psychology of Women, which will focus on studying women's minds as a specialization within the discipline.  From the current website of the committee on women in psychology:

Specifically, the committee will undertake the following priority tasks

(a) collection of information and documentation concerning the status of women;

(b) development of recommendations relevant to women;

(c) monitoring the implementation of guidelines and recommendations from reports issued by APA that are relevant to women;

(d) development of mechanisms to increase the participation of women in roles and functions both within and outside the profession;

(e) ongoing communications with other agencies and institutions regarding the status of women; and

(f) monitoring current issues relevant to the lives of women in order to inform policy.

The Committee shall consist of six members who are elected for staggered terms of three years.  It shall report to Council through the Board for the Advancement of Psychology in the Public Interest (BAPPI). (Approved by Council, February 2008)

Strategic Goals

Goal I 
 Promoting the health and well-being of women

Goal II  
Identifying and eliminating discriminatory practices against women

Goal III 
Increasing the visibility of feminist scholarship and practice

Goal IV 
Promoting the unique contributions of women to psychology

Goal V  
Enhancing women’s leadership within and outside of APA

Goal VI 
Collaborating with others as needed to achieve the empowerment of underrepresented groups

Goal VII 
Promoting the generation and communication of knowledge about women’s lives

And Division 35: the Society for the Psychology of Women:

&gt; Division 35: Society for the Psychology of Women provides an organizational base for all feminists, women and men of all national origins, who are interested in teaching, research, or practice in the psychology of women. The division recognizes a diversity of women's experiences which result from a variety of factors, including ethnicity, culture, language, socioeconomic status, age, and sexual orientation. The division promotes feminist research, theories, education, and practice toward understanding and improving the lives of girls and women in all their diversities; encourages scholarship on the social construction of gender relations across multicultural contexts; applies its scholarship to transforming the knowledge base of psychology; advocates action toward public policies that advance equality and social justice; and seeks to empower women in community, national, and global leadership. We welcome student members and affiliates. Members are provided two publications: *Psychology of Women Quarterly*, which is a journal of research, theory, and reviews, and the *Feminist Psychologist*.

Present a paper outlining psychometrics and the use of statistical measures in psychology. This should be connected, conceptually, to the problem of the the taxonomy of mental disorders. It is a good idea, then, to wait until after Spitzer presents the Feigner criteria in 1972. If elected president, it can be your presidential address. If not, it should be a regular paper.

### Barbara Gittings Biography

You are a Librarian, activist and a pioneer of the American gay rights movement. You founded the New York chapter of the Daughters of Bilitis and edited its magazine, The Ladder. One of your life-long goals has been to get public libraries to provide more information on homosexuality to the public.

You were born on July 31, 1932 in Vienna, Austria. Your father, a career diplomat, was transferred back to the US in 1940, and your family settled in Delaware.

During your freshman year at Northwestern in 1949, you sought out therapy because you believed you might be a lesbian. The psychotherapist offered to cure you. Rather than submit to treatment, you went to the libraries to find information on homosexuality. The few resources you discovered were filed under 'perverted' or 'abnormal.' Moreover, the material on offer dealt almost exclusively with gay men.

As a result of the time you spent in the library researching homosexuality, you failed out of Northwestern. When you returned 'back east,' you moved to Philadelphia.

But you continued your research. In Philadelphia, you discovered a book titled The Homosexual in America (1951), written under the pseudonym 'Donald Webster Cory .'  You contacted the publisher and eventually contacted the author Edward Sagarin, who introduced you to the fledgling homophile movement, including the Mattachine Society.

When you went out to California to meet with the publishers of ONE, you met Phyllis Lyon and Del Martin, leaders of the lesbian organization Daughters of Bilitis. They asked you to found a chapter in New York, even though it meant a commute from Philly. You accepted.  

At a DOB meeting in 1961, you met another activist named Kay Lahusen. The two of you fell in love and soon became partners for life.

You succeeded Lyon and Martin as editor of DOB's magazine, The Ladder. During your three-year editorship, The Ladder began to publish articles critiquing medical authorities as well as the notion that homosexuals were sick.

In the early 1960's, your position in the DOB lead you to meet and collaborate with Frank Kameny.  Kameny's Washington DC chapter of the Mattachine Society was becoming more and more aggressive in its public advocacy, and you were encouraged. In 1965, you joined Kameny in a picket of  the White House. And the two of you organized annual demonstrations on July 4 at Independence Hall in Philly.

These tactics were not entirely welcome in the community at the time. You left the DOB because of these conflicts and joined Kameny's Mattachine society full time.

#### Specific Assignments

Participate in the 1971 panel discussion with John Fryer and Evelyn Hooker. The texts of Kameny and Gitting's actual speeches are not recorded (to my knowledge), but Gittings' was probably titled “Gay, Proud and Healthy.”  Eyewitnesses record that Kameny was more confrontational and antagonistic to psychiatry while Gittings was more conciliatory. Kameny is quoted as arguing that “We're rejecting you all as our owners. We possess ourselves and we speak for ourselves and we will take care of our destines.” (Quoted in Bayer, 2002 p. 106).

As B. Gittings, propose a study, similar to E. Hookers, on lesbians, recruiting from the Daughters of Bilitis in 1971.  You can see the gamemaster or the original Siegelman, 1972.

Petition the conference committee for a display booth for 1972 titled 'Gay, Proud and Healthy', get Fryer and others to sit at the booth and take questions. As a student, if you are interested, there are photos of the actual booth available at http://digitalgallery.nypl.org/nypldigital/id?1606166. You should distribute a pamplet as well (the Kameny papers archive has a copy of the original, for inspiration).

You should maintain 'zapping' events where you determine discrimination, or the intellectual basis for discrimination, occur.

Help organize a symposium in 1973 on the topic of “Should Homosexuality Be in the APA Nomenclature?”

Your Biography
You are Evelyn Hooker, legend in the field of the psychology of human sexuality. In 1991, The APA  publicly recognizing you with an award for Distinguished Contribution in the Public Interest from the American Psychological Association. Your acceptance speech detailed your most famous study, and how it came to be. This is a rare case for a 'Reacting' character, so please excuse us as we quote it in length. It is far more detailed that we would ever be able to piece together from other sources.
When you received the APA’s award for Distinguished Contribution in the Public Interest in August 1992, you made a speech, which covered this part of the history of the APA.  A long excerpt from that speech is included here for your character development.  Do not quote or even paraphrase this speech in the course of the game - this is here are a primary source for you to understand your character’s biography and experiences during this period.

In 1953, when I applied for a six-month grant from the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) to study nonpatient, nonprisoner homosexuals, I had no intention of starting a new career. What I did not fully anticipate was the wealth of research demands and opportunities, the lively interest and cooperation of the gay community, and the continued interest and offers of assistance from the Grants Division of NIMH.
After I applied for the NIMH grant, the late John Eberhart came to UCLA to spend a day with me. It was clear that he wanted to see what and who I was. It was the height of the McCarthy era: Communists and homosexuals were the objects of destructive witch hunts. At the end of the day, Dr. Eberhard said "We are prepared to make you the grant, but you may not receive it. Everyone is being investigated. If you don't receive it, you won't know why and we won't know why."
I can only assume that either I was not investigated or that it was a slipshod investigation. In either case, why? My husband was a very distinguished professor of English at UCLA. In every way, he presented the characteristics of traditional values, but he fought very hard against the University of California loyalty oath, as had I. If the FBI had dug more deeply into my history, they would have found a first husband who drove an ambulance in the Spanish Civil War. If the question came to the FBI's attention at all, how did they interpret my interest in gay men? I will never know. If it was investigated, I did not know it.
Under the direction of Philip Sapir (who became chief of extramural grants when Dr. Eberhard left NIMH), I received a series of specific research grants until 1961, when I received a Research Career Award. During this time, Philip Sapir took a personal interest in my research, making the resources of his position available in incredible ways. For example, he invited me to give a lecture at NIMH especially for the research scientists, and afterward to spend three days in a seminar with a handpicked group of them. Because I worked alone, his moral, financial, and intellectual assistance became of the utmost importance. When I expressed my gratitude, he said that, in his position, he had general knowledge of many research projects and that it was very gratifying to know one in detail. It is highly probable that, without his interest and help, I would have stopped after the first major paper, and would not be here today.
The Role of Serendipity 	  	
As I reflect on the adverse conditions potentially threatening the successful pursuit of the goals of my research, I am impressed by the many serendipitous conditions that made the research possible. For example, a site visitor stressed the "fact" that members of the study committee would consider that I was working with psychopathology and that I must have a psychiatric consultant. With many reservations, I went to see the chair of the Psychiatry Department. When he asked about the research, I told him I was studying "normal male homosexuals." He rose from his chair and said, "What do you think you are doing? There is no such person." He then referred me to Frederic Worden, who had just come to the department. I let Dr. Worden read my application. He, then, turned to me and said, "I have never seen such persons, but I sure would like to." He became a valuable consultant.
A second perennially recurring situation was the demand of university officials that the research be conducted at the university. I resisted this demand because to have yielded would have meant the end. Not a single person would have come. The first absolute condition was secrecy and confidentiality. By great good fortune, our home was a very spacious estate of an acre of ground with a garden study separate from the house. It was there that the research was conducted. Once a person opened the garden gate, he was invisible to the neighbors. Without this superb place in which to conduct the research, I would never have attempted it.
The Imperative of Confidentiality
It will be obvious to you that the absolute sine qua non of research into behavior thought to be "a sin, a crime, and a disease" is confidentiality. Before I began the research, my friend Christopher Isherwood lived in the study for a while. If I asked him for a favor, he would often reply, "Yes, if you will keep me out of Norwalk." Norwalk is a California mental institution. The triple stigma was never far from the minds of the men whom I came to know nor was it far from mine.
The ramifications of confidentiality in this project were very extensive. A young gay man recently asked, "How did they know they could trust you?" The answer is, I don't know. Every testing and life history session was tape recorded. I assured each person that only my secretary would listen to them and after transcribing them would erase the tapes. Did they believe me? Yes, apparently so. One man who was nationally known by his books called me long distance at frequent intervals to ask whether his tapes had been erased.
One of my objectives was to understand each life as fully as possible, and thus to keep all of the personally identifying data for each man. This meant, in my view, that it would be impossible to share this highly confidential material with a co-worker. Building confidentiality with the gay community at that time was not an easy task. I could not lightly, if at all, share these confidences with another. Informal applications to be a coinvestigator were numerous, but I continued to work alone until the data gathering phase was complete.
Working alone in such a stress- and trauma-laden field inevitably entails high psychological costs. Without a colleague with whom to share the sympathetic knowledge of human suffering, sometimes one's own vicarious suffering becomes almost unbearable. This was especially true for me after my husband's death. I hasten to make clear that, when I characterize conducting research with gay men as stressful, I am only referring to the McCarthy era when the penalties were barbaric.
Even then, had I chosen just to remain in my study and let the gay men come to me, perhaps the stress would have been less. I could not settle for less. Instead, I accepted invitations to gay parties, gay organizations, gay after-hours clubs, and gay bars. I was convinced that, because of the secrecy imposed on gay men whose occupations and very lives were at risk if their identity became known, it was essential to know and understand everything I could about the gay social milieu that they created.
How it came to be known as the "gay world" remains a mystery to me. As I know it, however, the term in its generic meaning is, in part, justified. Camping, for example, is a dramatic form of behavior in both its high and low comic and tragic aspects. Perhaps an illustration will convey something of both. One evening at a dinner party attended by a number of distinguished writers and myself as the only woman, attention turned to how the guests could enhance my knowledge of gay institutions, for example, gay baths. My friend, Christopher Isherwood, then began a very dramatic story about how he would take me to the Crystal Baths on the Santa Monica beach, and what we would see, beginning on Level 1 – nude men in various sexual activities – complete with hilarious descriptions of the activities on each of the various levels until we reached the top. And then, he said, I would be killed, because no woman is allowed to know the secrets of the gay world and live.
The issue of confidentiality became acute in what I shall refer to later as "the Year of the Trial." Meanwhile, my adversarial position vis-a-vis the Los Angeles police force needs some clarification. I was pressured by a psychiatrist friend to seek an appointment with the chief of police. My friend said, "Of course he knows about your research activities and it would be helpful if he met you in person." How would the chief of police know about my research activities? In an invited paper entitled "The Gay Community," given in Copenhagen in 1961, I have described my research activities in gay bars. The police would have been aware of these activities, in part because I was usually the only woman in a bar. I hasten to add that I always went to a gay bar with a gay friend.
I was advised by my psychiatrist friend not to go alone for the appointment with the chief. Why? Because I was a woman. Dr. Worden accompanied me, biting his nails and saying that he had watched too many police films. Chief Parker did not understand why I was doing the research, "because a man from Pasadena proved it was all glandular." When I objected, he said "Well, it's like the smog. It doesn't matter how it got here. We just have to deal with it." He then wanted to introduce me to the Central Vice detail. I avoided that because I knew that if I did, the news would be all over the gay community within hours. I asked whether the police would ever try to subpoena my confidential files. "No," he replied, "If you should ever have information about a homosexual murder, I hope you would voluntarily give us the information."
I turn now to the Year of the Trial, 1961. Briefly, the facts are that five people were arrested and charged with conspiracy to obtain a criminal abortion. The five were two psychiatrists, an obstetrician, a young man, and myself. I had referred the young man (a friend) and his girlfriend to one psychiatrist, who had recommended a therapeutic abortion and who had sent the pair to a second psychiatrist, who made the same recommendation and sent them to an obstetrician. He performed the surgery in his office without a nurse present and sent the woman home. Complications developed. Her boyfriend insisted on hospitalization. Her father moved her to another hospital and declared charges to the police.
When two men, identifying themselves as with the state board of quality assurance visited me in my university office, I became alarmed when they asked "On what do you do research?" and "Do you accept fees for referrals?" It did not occur to me that I was personally in danger. However, waves of anxiety swept over me as I thought about the perils to my research data riddled with identifying names, places, and dates. I knew, as did many, of the unscrupulous surveillance practices of the Los Angeles Police Department at that time. My secretary and I spent the better part of the year in removing identifying data from the records. A judge, six months after the grand jury indictment, ruled that the jury had insufficient grounds to indict me. The anxiety did not diminish until both psychiatrists and the young man were declared innocent. Many of my friends believe that the police acted in my case only because of my research on homosexuality. It cannot be proved, but I believe it is so.
Incidentally, I carried a letter signed by the Chancellor at UCLA which identified me in case my activities were ever brought to the attention of law enforcement authorities. I never needed it, and felt I never would unless the university was involved.
The NIMH Task Force 	  	
In 1969, I was called by Stanley Yolles, then director of NIMH, asking me to come to Washington and "tell him what we ought to be doing about homosexuality." He added that "we want to sweep it out from beneath the rug." I suggested that we needed a group of thoughtful people who were social scientists or were in law, religion, or psychiatry and who could bring their knowledge to bear on this question. The director replied that if I would give him a list, he would make the appointments for a "blue ribbon task force." I looked forward to it with high expectations.
The agenda that I proposed was both a comprehensive outline of research and of social policy issues, including the possible endorsement of a model penal code and the establishment at NIMH of a center for the study of sexuality. Many members of the task force said at the outset that they knew nothing about homosexuality. I thought that should not exclude them because they were needed to bring social science to bear on the issues. The discussions were lively and gave promise of a good final report, with two exceptions.
The stumbling blocks were viewing homosexuality as not necessarily synonymous with psychopathology, and endorsing a model penal code in which homosexuality was no longer viewed as a crime. Thus, three task force members wrote dissenting opinions on the basis that (a) NIMH was not a policymaking, but solely a research institution, and (b) that there were not enough data to support the "normal" position. Within three years, however, the American Psychiatric Association voted to delete homosexuality from its diagnostic handbook, and the American Psychological Association (APA) followed.
Our task force report was not published for two years, an indication of what some officials thought of it. Judd Marmor, a distinguished and indispensable member of the task force, when asked why we did not accomplish more, said that one possible reason might be that I was too optimistic. That may be true. After all, in 1963, Dr. Marmor asked me to write a chapter for his first book on homosexuality, titled Inversion. He said that I must write it, "because you are the only person to hold your point of view."
Highlights and Satisfactions 	  	
I have spoken of some of the problems related to my research in the repressive milieu of the 1950s and I 960s. I would like now to mention some highlights of my satisfaction and delight.
First, can you imagine what it was like when I examined the results of the three judges of the adjustment ratings from the projective techniques? I knew the men for whom the ratings were made, and I was certain as a clinician that they were relatively free of psychopathology. But what would these superb clinicians find? You know now that the two groups, homosexuals and heterosexuals, did not differ in adjustment of psychopathology. When I saw that, I wept with joy. I knew that the psychiatrists would not accept it then. But sometime!
[cut, for the purposes of the game]
Another, earlier event was back in 1961, when I was invited to give a paper at the International Congress of Psychology. I learned that a young Norwegian, Finn Carling, was beginning a study of homosexuals and that it would be worth my while to see him. When I called him, he said that he was just beginning and that it would not be worth my while. I persisted, and he agreed to meet me at the airport. "You will know me because I have a big dog," he said. And so he did. Friends told me he was a spastic. Don't ask me how he drove his car, because he had the use of two forefingers only. He said, "If you don't mind not talking about science for awhile, I will show you where I grew up." He pointed to a stream running through a meadow where his parents had put him, having been told he would never walk. But he did – at 15.
After we had tea, he turned to me and said, "I want you to know that I am on their side." I think I said, "Me too." And then he said an astonishing thing: "I am not only studying homosexuals, but I am studying refugees, because they teach me the meaning of movement. I am studying the blind, because they will teach me the meaning of sight, of vision. I am studying homosexuals, because they will teach me the meaning of love.
That was 30 years ago, but Finn Carling's radiant face, his enormous physical and psychological courage, and what he wanted to learn from gay and lesbian folk have never faded in intensity. In an age when the scourge of AIDS continues relentlessly, there are many images of love in the gay world. I have the conviction that without love, the gay world would perish.
In the summer of 1937, at the height of the Spanish Civil War, I was in London. I attended a Spanish Republican rally. It was at fever pitch, so to speak, and the crowd was demanding that Paul Robeson, that great man and great voice, sing the Spanish National Anthem. From time to time, he would say "I'm saving the best to the last." Finally, with sounds that seemed to come from the bowels of the earth, he sang the Spanish National Anthem.
I have one more event to note, and I have saved the most extraordinary to the Last. About four years ago, I received a letter from a trustee officer at a bank in Lincoln, Nebraska. In it he stated that Wayne Placek had designated me to select a committee to decide how the trust fund he was establishing should distribute funds for the purpose of research to increase "the general public's understanding of gay men and lesbians, and reduce the stress experienced by those people in this and future civilizations." I remember that I had interviewed Wayne Placek in the late 1950s, but nothing unusual came to mind. I did remember that, along with many others, he hated being gay because of society's treatment.
After a period of three years, the final settlement of the fund was announced – approximately a half million dollars! Through the valiant and imaginative work of Steve Morin and Douglas Kimmel, the money now is in the American Psychological Foundation, earmarked for research under the control of Dr. Morin and selected officers of Division 44, and the guidance of the Foundation.

Game Objectives
You were trained as a behaviorist, by Karl Muenzinger and Robert Yerkes, who was a good friend of John Watson. Many of Watson's arguments draw from comparative psychology as a discipline. Muensinger's view, however, was more like Tolman's than Yerkes (see the “History of Definitions of 'Psychology'” in the gamebook). You are committed—as is your field—to the thesis that one can learn about the psychology of humans by studying the minds of animals. If the cognitivists are successful at getting the line between “man and brutes” reestablished, it may relegate your field to a psychological footnote.  Defend behaviorism, in particular the thesis that there is no hard and fast line between humans and animals, from the attacks of the cognitivitsts.

You published a pivotal study on homosexuality in 1956 and 1957 that along with Kinsey's report, is usually credited with starting the movement to remove homosexuality from the DSM.  Look up the study and read it carefully. You'll be expected to speak about its findings during the 1971 conference.  You should also understand your opponent's position on this matter.
Freud mentions homosexuality a number of places in Introductory Lectures on Psychoanalysis, and it is crucially important that you study these carefully.  Freud believes that sexual life of children, which is regarded at the time as 'normal' includes a number of activities that would later in life be viewed as 'perverse', including same-sex contact.  In Freud's theory, heterosexuality develops with puberty in normal people. In 'inverts' or homosexuals, something goes wrong in this development. The object of ones' 'natural' desire--the genitals of the opposite sex—becomes transformed into parts of the body that represent those parts in the same sex.  Thus, homosexuality is no different in psychological mechanism than a foot fetish or any other neurotic 'perversion' (see p. 376-384 of Introductory Lectures) Homosexuality is not a psychologically isolated condition. According to Freud:
“We are compelled, however, to regard the choice of an object of one's own sex as a divergence in erotic life which is of positively habitual occurrence, and we are learning more and more to ascribe an especially high importance to it.” (p. 381)
In short, homosexuality is a kind of neurosis, yet it is not, itself, particularly worrying. The action itself is merely 'habitual,' and hence can be cured through standard habit-blocking therapy (Freud suggests that paranoia stops homosexuality on p. 381 of the Introductory Lectures).  It is, however, invariably an indicator of deeper psychological problems, as the transference and substitution of the 'natural' object of sexual desire to a different object will cause neurosis. See Ch 26 of the Introductory Lectures, especially p. 530, for Freud's explanation of homosexuality as neurotic narcissism.
Your study, which sought to establish if homosexuals exhibited neurotic symptoms aside from their homosexuality, is a direct challenge to Freud's theory.  The current advocates of the Freudian tradition in Homosexuality are C. Socarides and I. Bieber.  Bieber's 1962 book Homosexuality presented the result of his 9-year study of 100 homosexual males. According to him, homosexuals males are those whose 'heterosexual instinct' is crippled in some way. Be ready to defend your study against criticisms from Socarides and Bieber.
When, and if, the game reaches a point of trying to define mental illness, you must pass a behaviorist interpretation of mental disorder / illness.
Specific Assignments
You are an initial member of the program committee, with your term expiring in 1972. That means it is your responsibility to coordinate with the other two members (Gebhard and Anastasi) to arrange the conference schedule for the second week of class. After that, consider running for the Board of Directors or President of the APA. 71: Washington DC, 72: Dallas.
In 1971, you are scheduled to give a talk entitled “The mental health of non-patient male homosexuals” during the panel session titled “ Psychiatry: Friend or Foe to Homosexuals: A Dialogue” with John Fryer. This talk should introduce the history of your research, and the data you have that shows that non-patient homosexuals are not mentally disordered. You might also make reference to the 1964 ‘Midtown Manhatten Study’ (1964), which seems to show that mental health disturbances are more related to social-economic status than any other factor—in this case, it may be consistent with your findings that any perceived mental illness is gay men is the result of their ostracism from society, rather than the cause thereof. 
In 1972, there will probably be competing papers from Socrides &amp; Bieber and Richard Green. Both of these papers will likely contain critiques or analyzes of your data. Be prepared to defend your study, or use it to critique others.
In 1973, oppose the dissolution of the nomenclature committee on grounds that the proposed taskforce would give too much power to a single individual: Spitzer.  The process of classifying mental illness needs to be open and transparent, and an elected committee would be more open and transparent than a taskforce.

##### Little Albert

Contrary to most textbooks that repeat the myth that 'Little Albert' was successfully deconditioned by Watson, was adopted by a family in North Baltimore and went on to live a long, happy, normal life; there is recent evidence to suggest that Little Albert died as a child. 

Using photographs from the family and FBI forensics experts, Beck et al. (2009) argue  that 'Little Albert' was likely Douglas Merritte, who died at age 6 of acquired hydrocephalus, after his mother had left Hopkins.  Watson never deconditioned Little Albert, and we simply have no evidence to determine if his conditioned fears remained until his death.  

See Beck, H. P., Levinson, S., &amp; Irons, G. (2009).  “Finding Little Albert: A Journey to John B. Watson’s Infant Laboratory.” American Psychologist, 64, 605-614. doi: 10.1037/a0017234. The authors conclude:

None of the folktales we encountered during our inquiry had a factual basis. There is no evidence that the baby's mother was 'outraged‚' at her son's treatment or that Douglas's phobia proved resistant to extinction. Douglas was never deconditioned, and he was not adopted by a family north of Baltimore.

Nor was he ever an old man. Our search of seven years was longer than the little boy's life. I laid flowers on the grave of my longtime 'companion' turned, and simultaneously felt a great peace and profound loneliness.

The APA's Monitor carried the story January 2010, 41(1): http://www.apa.org/monitor/2010/01/little-albert.aspx.

There were a number of blog posts that followed, including: http://mindhacks.com/2009/10/22/little-albert-lost-and-found. 

##### Socarides &amp; Bieber

The dates I used in the introduction are not exact, although I've tried to remain faithful where I could. Part of the problem here is that many of the stories that are circulated, even by eyewitnesses, vary.  Ron Gold, for example, dates the events in Hawaii to 1972, but the APA records the 1972 conference in Dallas, and the Hawaii conference to 1973.  

The Dr. H. Anonymous speech actually happened in 1972 during a symposium titled “Psychiatry: Friend or Foe to Homosexuals: A Dialogue”. It also featured Kameny and Gittings in addition to John Fryer. In 1971, Kameny, Gittings and   The panel titled “Lifestyles of non-patient homosexuals,” which the participants joking referred to as “Lifestyles of impatient homosexuals.” It featured Larry Littlejohn of the Society for Individual Rights in San Francisco, Del Martin, a founder the Lesbian activist organization Daughters of Bilitis, Lilli Vincenz, another lesbian activists, and Jack Baker, the gay president-elect of the student body of the University of Minnesota.1 I've found a number of websites and personal stories that get these two distinct events confused. At the risk of perpetuating these confusions, I've combined them into a single event in 1971.

Socarides petitioned the New York District branch for hist task force on sexual deviation. It was granted, and his report filed in 1972.  The leadership rejected the report, on the grounds that its basis in psychoanalytic theory was unacceptable. 

Complicating matters is the existence of NARTH, which has been adopted by many on the religious right in recent years.  In 1995, Socarides gave an interview to the NY Times, promoting his book “Homosexuality: A Freedom Too Far - A Psychoanalyst Answers 1,000 Questions About Causes and Cure and the Impact of the Gay Rights Movement on American Society”, in which he claimed that the declassification occurred because of political pressure and not scientific evidence.  The themes of the interview will be familiar to anyone with even tangential knowledge of the rhetoric of the far right: persecution of conservatives, liberal media bias, gay agendas and conspiracies, etc.  His son, Richard Socarides, who is gay, became a gay activist, advised President Clinton on LGBT issues, and ultimately was elected to the presidency of the activist organization 'Equality Matters.'  That fact has lead many defenders of Socarides to accuse any press figure who mentions it of making an 'ad hominem' attacks against Socarides. 

NARTH continues today under the directorship of Socarides' student Nicolosi.

The UK Newspaper 'The Independent' ran a story in January 2010 by Patrick Strudwick about his experience in gay-to-straight conversion program inspired by Nicolosi. The story created a national concern about psychiatrists in the UK who still may be offering psychotherapy to 'treat' or 'cure' homosexuality. The story is available here: http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/features/the-exgay-files-the-bizarre-world-of-gaytostraight-conversion-1884947.html

##### Leona Tyler Principle / Goldwater Rule

Following the Goldwater affair, the American Psychiatric Association added  section7.3 to their The Principles of Medical Ethics With Annotations Especially Applicable to Psychiatry, which states:

On occasion psychiatrists are asked for an opinion about an individual who is in the light of public attention or who has disclosed information about himself/herself through public media. In such circumstances, a psychiatrist may share with the public his or her expertise about psychiatric issues in general. However, it is unethical for a psychiatrist to offer a professional opinion unless he or she has conducted an examination and has been granted proper authorization for such a statement.

This section has become known as 'The Goldwater Rule.' For a full history, see Mayer, John D. (2010) “The Goldwater Rule: The rationale of the Goldwater Rule” Psychology Today Blog (http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-personality-analyst/201005/the-goldwater-rule)

The American Psychological Association adopted  'Leona Tyler principle' was adopted in 1973 by the American Psychological Association, and still holds today. It states:

&gt; As citizens, members of the APA have the right to advocate for any cause through the myriad of political advocacy organizations, but when psychologists and psychiatrists speak for the profession through APA public stances and proclamations, it should be from science and professional experience.  

The principle was named for Leona Tyler simply because she was president at the time, not necessarily because she advocated for it, as she does in this game. 

##### Marr

David Marr joins Miller and Chomsky at MIT in 1977 and then dies in 1980 of Leukemia. His posthumously published book *Vision* is still standard reading in cognitive science courses.

##### Declassification

The story of the declassification of homosexuality as a mental illness has been retold a couple of times in recent years.  Famously, Alix Spiegel, grandson of John P. Spiegel, produced a version of the story for NPR's show 'This American Life'. The episode, named '81 words' is available online at http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/204/81-words. It is an excellent retelling of these events, and partially inspired this game. Ron Gold's retelling of the event is available here: http://www.queerstories.org/custom.html.

In the character sheet for Spitzer, I express some doubts about the standard story told by Spiegel, because Spitzer's timing and motivation for inserting himself into the controversy doesn't seem to match up for normal person. In a 2005 issue of The New Yorker Magazine, Spiegel writes that 

Despite Spitzer’s genius at describing the particulars of emotional behavior, he didn’t seem to grasp other people very well. Jean Endicott, his collaborator of many years, says, “He got very inv.ved with issues, with ideas, and with questions. At times he was unaware of how people were responding to him or to the issue. He was surprised when he learned that someone was annoyed. He’d say, ‘Why was he annoyed? What’d I do?’” After years of confrontations, Spitzer is now aware of this shortcoming, and says that he struggles with it in his everyday life. “I find it very hard to give presents,” he says. “I never know what to give. A lot of people, they can see something and say, ‘Oh, that person would like that.’ But that just doesn’t happen to me. It’s not that I’m stingy. I’m just not able to project what they would like.” Frances argues that Spitzer’s emotional myopia has benefitted him in his chosen career: “He doesn’t understand people’s emotions. He knows he doesn’t. But that’s actually helpful in labeling symptoms. It provides less noise.”2

If this is correct, my argument about the implausibility of the Chair of the Nomenclature Committee attending Socarides' speech in New York without expectation of a demonstration may be wrong. I leave it in, because a student playing the part needs to think himself or herself into Spitzer's position, not his particular characteristics—and whatever unique mind Robert Spitzer has, it is probably uncommon in undergraduates.

##### Spitzer Task force

 See ch 3 of  Kutchins &amp; Kirk (2003) Making Us Crazy.  

Homdysphilia was proposed by Spitzer without consultation with the subcommittee on human sexuality.  Green sent Spitzer a strongly worded criticism of both the classification and the method Sptizer used to introduce it and resigns in protest.  Spitzer constructs a 'survey' instrument that he sends out to the entire taskforce and finds that there isn't enough agreement on the issue to leave it with the subcommittee, and presents the idea to the entire taskforce, thus outmaneuvering Green. The committee narrowly approves 'ego-dystonic homosexuality', but isn't thrilled. Judd Marmor, who voted in favor, writes later that he would have preferred no mention of homosexuality, but politics required it.

##### Averson Therapy

(from wikipedia) Since 1994, the American Psychological Association has declared that aversion therapy is a dangerous practice that does not work.[citation needed] Since 2006, the use of aversion therapy to treat homosexuality has been in violation of the codes of conduct and professional guidelines of the American Psychological Association and American Psychiatric Association. The use of aversion therapy to treat homosexuality is illegal in some countries. The standard in psychotherapy in America and Europe is currently Gay Affirmative Psychotherapy. Guidelines for Gay Affirmative Psychotherapy can be found by APA. [4]

From Issues in Psychotherapy with Lesbian and Gay Men: A Survey of Psychologists. Linda Garnets, Los Angeles, CA Kristin A. Hancock, Berkeley, CA Susan D. Cochran, California State University, Northridge Jacqueline Goodchilds, University of California, Los Angeles Letitia Anne Peplau, University of California, Los Angeles. Report of the APA. http://search.apa.org/search?facet=classification%3aSexuality||classification%3aTherapy&amp;query=Aversion%20Therapy

In 1975, the American Psychological Association (APA) took a strong stance regarding bias toward lesbians and gay men, resolving that homosexuality per se implies no impairment in judgment, reliability or general social and vocational abilities (see Appendix A for the full text of the resolution). The APA urged psychologists to take the lead in removing the stigma of mental illness long associated with homosexual orientations (Conger, 1975). In recent years, attention has been drawn to ways in which a client's ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, or physical disability can affect clinical judgment and treatment strategies. There has been a corresponding effort to develop guidelines to help practitioners avoid bias in psychotherapy (APA, 1975). Recognizing that practice does not spontaneously or quickly follow policy changes, the Committee on Lesbian and Gay Concerns (CLGC), sponsored jointly by the Board of Social and Ethical Responsibility in Psychology (BSERP) and the Board of Professional Affairs (BPA), formed a task force in 1984 to investigate the range of bias that may occur in psychotherapy with lesbians and gay men. This article is an abridged report of the task force's research, findings, and recommendations.

##### Reparative therapy

rejected repeatedly by the APA, most recently in 2008.

##### Evelyn Hooker

E. Hooker was given 1991 Award for Distinguished Contribution to Psychology in the Public Interest, presented by the American Psychological Association. The citation read:

"When homosexuals were considered to be mentally ill, were forced out of government jobs, and were arrested in police raids, Evelyn Hooker courageously sought and obtained research support from the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) to compare a matched sample of homosexual and heterosexual men. Her pioneering study, published in 1957, challenged the widespread belief that homosexuality is a pathology by demonstrating that experienced clinicians using psychological tests widely believed at the time to be appropriate could not identify the nonclinical homosexual group. This revolutionary study provided empirical evidence that normal homosexuals existed, and supported the radical idea then emerging that homosexuality is within the normal range of human behavior. Despite the stigma associated with homosexuality, she received an NIMH Research Career Award in 1961 to continue her work. In 1967, she became chair of the NIMH Task Force on Homosexuality, which provided a stamp of validation and research support for other major empirical studies. Her research, leadership, mentorship, and tireless advocacy for an accurate scientific view of homosexuality for more than three decades has been an outstanding contribution to psychology in the public interest."

### Your Biography
You are Kenneth Clark, a psychologist, educator, and social reformer dedicated to understanding and eradicating racial injustice.  You grew up in Harlem, attending the integrated schools of NY City, but attended college at Howard University in D.C. There, you met Mamie Phipps, who eventually became your wife, and with whom you authored numerous studies on the psychological damage caused by segregation and racism. You were the first African American to receive a Doctorate in Psychology from Columbia, and the first black permanent professor at City College of New York, where you still teach.

In addition to your excellent academic collaboration with Mamie, together you founded Harlem's Northside Center for Child Development in 1946, with the mission to “fosters the healthy development of children and families and seeks to empower them to respond constructively to negative societal factors including racism and its related consequences. Through comprehensive, high quality mental health and educational services, coupled with research, children and families are aided in developing to their full potential.”

In your most famous study (co-authored with Mamie), you presented four identical plastic dolls that different only with respect to color to black children between the ages of three and seven. When asked which doll they preferred, the majority selected the white doll. When asked to color in a drawing 'the same color' as themselves, most of the black children choose yellow or white crayons.  You concluded that “prejudice, discrimination, and segregation” had caused the children to develop a sense of self-hatred and inferiority.

The study become something of a sensation, and it is still included in most introductory psychology textbooks. It's effects, however, were much more profound that that.

In 1950, You (Kenneth), wrote a summary of the paper for the Midcentury White House Conference on Children and Youth.  The summary was read, ultimately, by Robert Carter, who was one of the NAACP lawyers pushing the various cases challenging segregation that ultimately were consolidated into the pivotal 1954 Brown v. The Board of Education decision.  The NAACP contracted you as an expert witness for at least three cases: Briggs v. Elliot (South Carolina) , Davis v. County School Board of Prince Edward County and Belton v. Gebhart (Delaware). You co-authored the summation that was ultimately endorsed by leading social scientists at the time when it went before the Supreme court.


Writing for a unanimous court, Chief Justice Warren stated

&gt;“Does segregation of children in public schools solely on the basis of race, even though the physical facilities and other "tangible" factors may be equal, deprive the children of the minority group of equal educational opportunities? We believe that it does.”

Quoting from the appellate court (which actually ruled against the NAACP), Chief Justice Warren argued:

&gt; "Segregation of white and colored children in public schools has a detrimental effect upon the colored children. The impact is greater when it has the sanction of the law; for the policy of separating the races is usually interpreted as denoting the inferiority of the negro group. A sense of inferiority affects the motivation of a child to learn. Segregation with the sanction of law, therefore, has a tendency to [retard] the educational and mental development of negro children and to deprive them of some of the benefits they would receive in a racial[ly] integrated school system."  

Whatever may have been the extent of psychological knowledge at the time of Plessy v. Ferguson, this finding is amply supported by modern authority.11  Any language [347 U.S. 483, 495]   in Plessy v. Ferguson contrary to this finding is rejected.

Footnote 11, which supports the central finding of Brown, cites your 1950 memo “Effect of Prejudice and Discrimination on Personality Development.”

In the 1896 case Plessy v. Ferguson, the Supreme court ruled that so long as railroad accommodations were 'separate but equal', the state of Louisiana was allowed to enforce racial segregation.  The court reasoned that laws which kept races separated did not necessarily entail the inferiority of one to the other. Your study was pivotal in the Warren's court rejection of that idea.

Brown v. Board of Education was not only a milestone in the modern civil rights movement, it also made you into something of an academic superstar. You went on to become the most influential black social scientist of your generation. You received honorary degrees from more than a dozen of the nation's finest colleges and universities, but your larger goal of integrated, adequate schooling for blacks had not become a reality even four decades after the announcement of the monumental court decision.

In the 1960s, you helped establish the Harlem Youth Opportunities Unlimited, a project that influenced President Lyndon Johnson's War on Poverty program.

Your many books include Prejudice and Your Child (1955), Dark Ghetto: Dilemmas of Social Power (1965), and The Negro American (1966).  

### Game Objectives

As an initial member of the Research committee, you'll be called upon to judge the scientific legitimacy and ethical acceptability of proposed research programs.  You should make yourself familiar with the sections of the game book titled 'A Primer on Research Methods' and 'Ethics of Human Research'.  Your gamemaster will give you an additional sheet outlining the responsibilities of members of the research committee in evaluating proposals.  In the first year, you are likely to get a proposal to the research committee that proposes an experiment on a child. It is vital that you prompt the committee as a whole to seriously consider the nature of 'consent' in the context of  power dynamics and social inequality.

Oppose the passing of the 'Leona Tyler principle', which states:

&gt;“As citizens, members of the APA have the right to advocate for any cause through the myriad of political advocacy organizations, but when psychologists and psychiatrists speak for the profession through APA public stances and proclamations, it should be from science and professional experience.  

On occasion psychiatrists are asked for an opinion about an individual who is in the light of public attention or who has disclosed information about himself/herself through public media. In such circumstances, a psychiatrist may share with the public his or her expertise about psychiatric issues in general. However, it is unethical for a psychiatrist to offer a professional opinion unless he or she has conducted an examination and has been granted proper authorization for such a statement.”

Get elected president.  That can be before or after your symposium.

You are neutral on the definition of mental illness. 

#### Specific Assignments
Organize, propose and participate in a symposium on the role of psychology as a mechanism of social change or more generally, on the social responsibilities of scientists, preferably in 1973.  Chomsky and Marmor may be a good choices as a co-panelists. You should present a paper on psychology's role for social good. If you are elected president, it should be your presidential address. If not, it can be a part of the symposium.

In 1975, propose an affirmative action plan for psychology and psychiatry. Here's the real language. You should adapt it to your needs:

&gt; THERE IS a continuous need to increase the number of minority psychiatrists; the American Psychiatric Association has consistently demonstrated its commitment to the principle of affirmative action as reflected in its efforts of recruitment and training of minority psychiatrists. APA has previously developed and instituted policies recognizing and supporting the special mental health issues of minority populations; however, there are serious threats to affirmative action programs that have facilitated the following endeavors: APA reaffirms these commitments and policies by 1) issuing a public statement drawing attention to the potential deleterious effects that such threats pose to the delivery of health services to minority groups; 2) actively participating with other professional and educational groups to assure continued recruitment and training of minority candidates in medical disciplines; and 3) further exploring and developing, through its appropriate components, mechanisms to assure continued implementation of these commitments.

### Your Biography

You are Stanley Milgram, social psychologist. You were born August 15, 1933 to a family of  Jewish immigrants from Germany who had settled in the Bronx and opened a bakery. By all accounts, you had a warm and untroubled childhood.

Your intelligence was spotted early in life and encouraged by your parents. In one legendary event, your experiments with your chemistry set brought the local fire department. You are most famous for your 'obedience' experiments starting in 1961 at Yale. These experiments sought to understand how normal people could do horrible things to others in the presence of an authority figure. Many people have drawn parallels between your experiments and the behavior of Nazi soldiers in the Holocaust, or even the actions of academics during the McCarthy era in the US. One biographer (Blass, 2004) has noted that your Bar Mitzvah speech was on the plight on European Jews under Hitler, and the McCarthy purges at Queens College occurred when you were enrolled.

After completing your undergraduate study in 1954, you applied to Harvard's Department of Social Relations, an interdisciplinary program that included social psychology, sociology, anthropology and clinical psychology. You were rejected.  You persisted, however, taking summer classes in psychology. Eventually, they let you in provisionally. You were admitted to the full program after a year.

There you worked with Solomon Asch, who was investigating conformity to group thinking by testing whether a subject would give the wrong answer to a question if it agreed with the group of experimental confederates.  For your dissertation, you extended this research by comparing Norwegians and French.

You moved to Yale in 1960, where you began designing your famous experiment. You submitted proposals to the National Science Foundation (NSF), the National Institutes of Mental Health (NIMH) and the Office of Naval Research.

You moved back to Harvard to direct the Department of Social Relations in 1963, but left for CUNY in 1966. You famous 'obedience' studies were conducted while you were at Yale. They have been the subject of great controversy, both from a scientific and ethical perspective.  As a student, make sure you are confident in the experimental protocol as well as the results. See Milgram 1963 and 1965 for the primary source report.

You now chair the graduate program in social psychology at CUNY.

In 1967, you published the famous 'small world' study, in which you randomly selected individuals in Omaha, Nebraska and Wichita, Kansas, and asked them to try to deliver a packet of information to a target person in Boston, Mass. If they did not know the target personally, they should give the letter to someone who might be able to pass it on.  Milgram then counted the number of contacts handled the packet in transit – the average was 5.5, giving us the common myth of 'six degrees of separation.'  

### Game Objectives

Get onto the research committee. While you have always had an interest in research ethics, the criticism of your experiments have made you develop something of an expertise in the APA standards (that means, of course, that you, as the student, need to develop an expertise with both Milgram's experimental design and the APA standards that are included in the gamebook).

You are neutral on the issue of the definition of mental illness.

#### Specific Assignments

If your class is larger than 16, you'll start as board-member-at-large for 1971.

Propose an experiment on campus testing the 'small world' problem in the campus environment in 1974.  Present your results (or, if the experiment is not completed in time, or denied by the research committee, the results of Milgram's original 1967 experiment) to the conference.

Oppose the proposal (from Clark, 1975) to create an affirmative action plan for psychology and psychiatry, on the grounds that it is an unwarranted authoritarian intervention in personal matters.  Milgram is quoted in Blass, 2004 (p. 201) as saying (in 1971):

 “There is some sense of progress and movement at the Graduate Center. A big question, however, is whether intellectual standards or political pressures will prevail in the conduct of our program. Already, we have been asked to recruit faculty on a racial basis, and we make exceptions to our usual admission standards in assessing potential black students. If carried too far, this could have disastrous consequences for the quality of the program. Then I'll leave.”

Present a paper summarizing your study of obedience (1963 and 1965) also in 1974, to complement the symposium on the social responsibility of academics.

Eobert A. Woodrmff,Jr., MD; George Winokur,MD; and Rodrigo M u m , MD, St. Louis
Diagnostic criteria for 14 psychiat- ric illnesses (and for secondary de- prnssion) along with the validating r,*idpncefor these diagnostic cate- ,/,,riescomes from workers outside ,,ti,. group as weU as from those within; it consists of studies of both outpatients and inpatients, of family studies, and of follow-up studies. These criteria are the most ~ficient currently avazhble; how- uzler, it is expected that the criteria be tested and not be considered a Atutl, closed system. It is expected thrrl the criteria uill change as vari-
~3 illnesses are studied by different gr~mps. Such criteria provide a f mmework for comparison of data gathered in different centers, and serve to promote communication be- tween investigators.

physiological, will result in a solution of the problem of whether patients described by different groups a r e comparable. This first and crucial taxonomic step should expedite psy- chiatric investigation.
Diagnosis has functions as im- portant in psychiatry a s elsewhere in medicine. Psychiatric diagnoses based on studies of natural history permit prediction of course and out- come, allow planning for both im- mediate and long-term treatment, and make communication possible between psychiatrists and other physicians, as well as among psychi- atrists themselves. Such functions are of obvious importance in re- search.1"
In contrast to the American Psy- chiatric Association Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disor- ders (DSM-II), in which the diag- nostic classification i s based upon the "best clinical judgement and experience" of a committee and its consultants, this communication will present a diagnostic classification validated primarily by follow-up and family studies. The following criteria for establishing diagnostic validity in psychiatric illness have been de- scribed elsewhere and may be divided into five phase^.^
TheFive Phases
more reliable, precise, and reproduci- ble than are clinical descriptions. When consistent with a defined clinical picture they permit a more refined classification. Without such a defined clinical picture, their value may be considerably reduced. Unfortunately, consistent and reliable laboratory find- ings have not yet been demonstrated in the more common psychiatric disor- ders.
3. Delimitation From Other Disorders. Since similar clinical features and laboratory findings may be seen in patients suffering from different dis- orders (eg, cough and blood in the sputum in lobar pneumonia, bronchi- ectasis, and bronchogenic carcinoma), it is necessary to specify exclusion cri- teria so that patients with other ill- nesses are not included in the group to be studied. These criteria should also permit exclusion of borderline cases and doubtful cases (an undiag- nosed group) so that the index group
may be as homogeneous as possible.
4. Follow-up Study.
The purpose of the follow-up study
is to determine whether or not the original patients a r e suffering from some other defined disorder that could account for the original clinical pic- ture. If they are suffering from anoth- er such illness, this finding suggests that the original patients did not com- prise a homogeneous group and that it is necessary to modify the diagnostic criteria. In the absence of known etiol- ogy or pathogenesis, which is true of the more common psychiatric disor- ders, marked differences in outconie, such a s between complete recovery
and chronic illness, suggest that the group is not homogeneous. This latter point is not as compelling in suggest- ing diagnostic heterogeneity as is the finding of a change in diagnosis. The same illness may have a variable prognosis, but until we know more about the fundamental nature of the common psychiatric illnesses, marked differences in outcome should be re- garded as a challenge to the validity of the original diagnosis.
5. Family Study.
Most psychiatric illnesses have been
shown to run in families, whether the
investigations were designed to study hereditarv or environnlental causes. independent of the questlon of etiolo-
gy, therefore, the firldillg of an in- creased prevalence of the same disor-

In general, the first step is to de- scribe the clinical picture of the disor- der. This may be a single striking clinical feature or a combination of clinical features thought to be associ- ated with one another. Race, sex, age at onset, precipitating factors, and other items may be used to define the clinical picture more precisely. The clinical picture thus does not include only symptoms.
2.Laboratmy Studies.
Included among laboratory studies
a r e chemical, physiological, radiologi-
￼der among close relatives of the origi- nal patients strongly indicates that one is dealing with a valid entity.
While no psychiatric syndrome has yet been fully validated by a complete series of steps, a great deal of work has been published indicat- ing that substantial validation is possible. This communication is a summary of that work in the form of specific diagnostic criteria. The studies of validation for each illness are cited. In addition, we in this department have carried out a study of interrater reliability and valida- tion of reliability with an 18-month follow-up study of 314 psychiatric emergency room patients (to be published) as well as a seven-year follow-up study of 87 psychiatric inpatients (to be published), each of whom was interviewed personally and systematically. There were four different raters in the emergency room study. Agreement ranged from 86% to 95% about diagnosis with diagnostic criteria similar to
those outlined in this report. There were two different raters in the in- patient study ; reliability between those raters was 92%. In the emer- gency room study and in the inpa- tient study, validity, as determined by correctly predicting diagnosis a t follow-up by criteria such as those of this report, was 93% and 92%, respectively.
Not only are specific criteria nec- essary for each diagnosis, but crite- ria are also needed for scoring indi- vidual symptoms a s positive. T h e following criteria have been used for this purpose. (1) The patient saw a physician (includes chiro- practor, naturopath, healer, etc) for the symptom. (2) The symptom was disabling enough to interfere with the patient's usual routine. ( 3 ) The symptom led the patient to take medication on more than one occa- sion. ( 4 ) The examining physician believes that, because of its clinical importance, the symptom should be scored positive even though the aforementioned criteria were not present; eg, a spell of blindness
lasting a few minutes that the pa- tient minimizes, or hallucinations or delusions which the patient does not recognize a s pathological, and which did not disrupt the patient's usual routine. (5) Symptoms are not scored positive if they can be ex- plained by a known medical disease of the patient (this does not apply to organic brain syndrome and men- tal retardation).
It will be apparent below that certain diagnoses are mutually ex- clusive (primary affective disorders and schizophrenia), while others may be made in the same patient
(antisocial personality disorder with alcoholism or drug dependen- cy ; hysteria or anxiety neurosis with secondary depression). More work will be necessary before the full significance of various diagnos- tic combinations becomes evident. I t should also be clear that any of the diagnoses may be further subdivid- ed according to various clinical, de- mographic, or other variables. For example, primary depression may be divided into psychotic and nonpsy- chotic, bipolar and unipolar, early onset and late onset. Simiiarly, schizophrenia may be subdivided into paranoid, hebephrenic, and cata- tonic subtypes.
fatigability, tiredness. (4) Agita- tion or retardation. (5) Loss of in- terest in usual activities, or de- crease in sexual drive. ( 6 ) Feelings of self-reproach or guilt (either may be delusional). ( 7) Complaints of or actually diminished ability t o think or concentrate, such as slow thinking or mixed-up thoughts. (8) Recurrent thoughts of death or sui-3 cide, including thoughts of wishing tobedead.
C. A psychiatric illness lasting at least one month with no preexisting psychiatric conditions such a s schiz- ophrenia, anxiety neurosis, phobic,$ neurosis, obsessive compulsive neu- rosis, hysteria, alcoholism, drug de- pendency, antisocial personality, homosexuality and other sexual de- viations, mental retardation, or or- ganic brain syndrome. ( Patients with life-threatening or incapacitat- ing medical illness preceding and paralleling the depression do not re- ceive the diagnosis of primary de- pression.)

with prominent delusions and hallu- inations in addition to the affective symptoms. Clinical studies of this disorder indicate that from 60% to 00% of cases have a remitting ill- ne&amp; and return to premorbid levels of psychosocial adjustment with a
, longitudinal course consistent with primary affective disorder.17-22 The remaining 10% to 40% have a chronic illness consistent with schiz- .~phrenia.These patients are, there- fore, classified as having an undiag- nowd psychiatric disorder and are nor included in either primary af- fective disorder or schizophrenia.
, Secondary Affective Disorders.- Secondary depression, "definite" or "probable," is defined in the same way a s primary depression, except that it occurs with one of the fol- ;wing: (1) A preexisting non-
~3'eotivepsychiatric illness which rsiay or may not still be present. (2) A life-threatening or incapacitating medical illness which precedes and parallels the symptom$ of depres- Yion.
Schizophrenia.l7-"-For a diag- nosis of schizophrenia A through C are required.
A. Both of the following are nec- wsary: (1) A chronic illness with a! least six months of symptoms
or to the index evaluation with- out return to the premorbid level of ~~ychosociaaldjustment. (2) Ab- sence of a period of depressive or manic. symptoms sufficient to quali- fy for affective disorder or probable affective disorder.
B. The patient must have a t least m e of the following : (1) Delusions ot.4allucinations without significant pf'l'dexity or disorientation associ- dtid with them. (2) Verbal produc- tion that makes communication dif- ficultbecause of a lack of logical or understandable organization. (In the presence of muteness the diag- GSKdeec'ision must be deferred.)
'We recognize that many patients
with schizophrenia have a charac- teristic blunted or inappropriate af- fect; however, when it occurs in mild form, interrater agrement is difficult to achieve. We believe that, on the basis of presently available information, blunted affect occurs rarely or not at all in the absence of B-1 or B-2.)
C. At least three of the following manifestations must be present for a diagnosis of "definite" schizophre- nia, and two for a diagnosis of "probable" schizophrenia. ( 1 ) Sin- gle. (2) Poor premorbid social ad- justment or work history. (3) Fam- ily history of schizophrenia. (4) Absence of alcoholism or drug abuse within one year of onset of psychosis. (5) Onset of illness prior to age 40.
Anxiety Neurosi~.~~-Foar diag- nosis of anxiety neurosis, A through D are required.
A. The following manifestations must be present: (1) Age of onset prior to 40. (2) Chronic nervous- ness with recurrent anxiety attacks manifested by apprehension, fear- fulness, o r sense of impending doom, with at least four of the fol- lowing symptoms present during the majority of attacks: (a) dys- pnea, ( b ) palpitations, ( c ) chest pain or discomfort, ( d ) choking or smothering sensation, (e) dizziness and (f)paresthesfas:
B. The anxiety attacks are essen- tial to the diagnosis and must occur a t times other than marked physical exertion or life-threatening situa- tions, and in the absence of medical illness that could account for symp- toms of anxiety. There must have been a t least six anxiety attacks, each separated by a t least a week from the others.
C. In the presence of other psy- chiatric illness(es) this diagnosis is made only if the criteria described in A and B antedate the onset of the other psychiatric illness by at least two years.
D. The diagnosis of probable anxiety neurosis is made when at least two symptoms listed in A-2
are present, and the other criteria are fulfilled.
Obsessive Compulsive Neuro- sis.33.34-For a diagnosis of obses- sive compulsive neurosis, both A and B are required.
A. Manifestations 1 and 2 are re- quired. (1) Obsessions or compul- sions are the dominapt symptoms. They are defined as recurrent or persistent ideas, thoughts, images, feelings, impulses, or movements, which must be accompaqied by a sense of subjective compulsion and a desire to resist the event, the event being recognized by the indi- vidual as foreign to his personality or nature, ie, "ego-alien." (2) Age of onset prior to 40.
B. Patients with primary or probable primary affective disorder, or with schizophrenia or probable schizophrenia, who manifest obses- sive-compulsive features, do not re- ceive the additional diagnosis of ob- sessive compulsive neurosis.
Phobic Neurosis.~~~3~--Foardi- agnosis of phobic neurosis, both A andB are required.
A. Manifestations 1 and 2 are re- quired. (1) Phobias are the domi- nant symptoms. They are defined as persistent and recurring fears which the patient tries to resist or avoid and at the same time consid- ers unreasonable. (2) Age of onset prior to 40.
B. Symptoms of anxiety, tension, nervousness, and depression may ac- company the phobias ; however, pa- tients with another definable psychi- atric illness should not receive the additional diagnosis of phobic neu- rosis.
H~steria.3~-~~-Faodriagnosis of hysteria, both A and B are re- quired.
A. A chronic or recurrent illness beginning before age 30, presenting with a dramatic, vague, or compli- cated medical history.
B. The patient must report a t least 25 medically unexplained symptoms for a "definite" diagnosis and 20 to.24 symptons for a "yroba- blewdiagnosis in at least nine of the

-Some patients cannot receive a diagnosis for one or more reasons. Among the more common problems that cause a patient to be considered undiagnosed are the following : ( 1) cases in which only one illness is suspected but symptoms are mini- mal. ( 2 ) Cases in which more than one psychiatric illness is suspected but symptoms are not sufficient to meet the criteria of any of the pos- sibilities. (3) Cases in which symp- toms suggest two or more disorders but in an atypical or confusing
nal body weight.
C. A distorted, implacable atti-
￼manner. (4) Cases in which the chronology of important symptom clusters cannot be determined. (5) Cases in which it is impossible to obtain the necessary history to es- tablish a definitive diagnosis.
Comment
There are many diagnoses listed in DSM-11 not considered in this communication because sumcient clinical data for even limited diag- nostic validation are not available. A recent attempt to delineate pas- sive-aggressive personality disorder as a separate entity based on cross- sectional and longitudinal data brings to focus some of the prob- lems in diagnostic validation. As the investigators of that study sug- gested, further studies are needed before the validity of that syndrome is
Finally, the criteria presented in this report are "minimal" in two senses : First, all diagnostic criteria are tentative in the sense that they change and become more precise with new data. Second, we have made no effort to subclassify these illnesses. (For example, we have presented criteria to define primary affective disorders, unipolar type, without suggestions for further subdivision into forms of early and late onset, psychotic or nonpsychot- ic forms, agitated or retarded forms, and so forth. It is clear that primary affective disorder, unipolar type, is a reasonable major classifi- cation. The data to support its sub- classification are still tentative.) W e and other investigators will contin- ue to work toward modification and subclassification. What we now present is our synthesis of existing information, a synthesis based on data rather than opinion or tradi- tion. We hope that such a presenta- tion will help to promote useful communication among investiga- tors.

            <Title>Game synopsis</Title>
            <Text>The narrative of the game begins, but does not end with, the demedicalization of homosexuality. This game is not intended to be a political game wherein the players are centrally interested in the collection and use of power.  Rather, this game is meant to be about evidence, and the interpretation of evidence. Bieber claims, for example, to have about 30% success rate in his ‘treatment’ of homosexuality. Is this an adequate? Especially as the pain it causes--as experience first-hand by Ron Gold.

More importantly, this game is not centrally *about* homosexuality.  That issue is completed largely in the first session.  This game is about whether or not science can legitimately posit underlying mechanisms to explain behavior or is restricted to merely cataloging and describing behavior. Spitzer’s proposed revisions to the DSM largely banished psychoanalytic taxonomies (and their assumed underlying psychodynamic mechanisms) from the official language of psychiatry. At the same time, Chomsky and Miller are reintroducing hypothetical mechanisms to Psychology, which has resisted them for half a century.

The three main factions have distinctly different views on this question: 

* The psychoanalysts believe that one cannot categorize human behavior without understanding the underlying mechanisms. 

* The behaviorists believe that science requires that the limit themselves only to describing behavior.  

* The cognitivists offer a third way, a kind of hybrid between the two, where mechanisms are required for adequate explanation of behavior, but they are ontologically limited to those that can be realized in the physical substrate of the human mind.

After the initial storm over homosexuality, the central question of the game is scientific legitimacy of psychoanalysis. This is a complicated issue, and will make allies of those initially divided over homosexuality---Marmor and Speigel will need to work with Socardes / Bieber to protect psychoanalysis from Spitzer and allies.

Spitzer is a bit of a wild card.  In reality, Spitzer was never enthralled with psychoanalysis. Once he understood the negative effects that medicalization was having on homosexuals, he consolidated control and forced the change to the DSM through sheer force. To this day, advocates for NARTH and ‘reparative therapy’ complain (probably justly) about his willingness to bend the rules. But this doesn’t mean that he was wrong---the evidence produced by Socardes and Bieber is terrible, while Hooker’s evidence is quite strong. It is up to you and the student to decide if your Spitzer will rely on the power of good ideas and evidence or ram the changes through using parliamentary tricks.

There are a number of other issues that will arise, including whether there can be, or should be, psychological study of women and minority communities.  And almost as importantly, what the responsibilities to the public good a scientist has.

The game culminates in the vote defining ‘mental illness.’  There should be at least 3 candidates proposed: Spitzer, Szasz and the Psychoanalysts.  In reality, no one definition ever passed, and the Psychiatric and Psychological community still operate without a formal definition.  In the world of your game, it’s pretty much up in the air if anyone will succeed in getting their definition passed.

            <Text>#### Psychoanalysts

Psychoanalysts are split in the classical (Freudian), Jungian and unspecified.  The game contains a number of independent psychiatrists who, while they are familiar with psychoanalysis, are not professed members of the faction.

##### Classical

Classical psychoanalysis can be summarized by five basic hypotheses:

1.	First, psychoanalysts hold that the mind is composed of entities in conflict, also known as the *hypothesis of intrapsychic conflict* or **dynamic hypothesis**. In classic Freudianism, the hypothesis followed “the discovery of the unconscious” by Breuer and Freud in 1895 (see &lt;!--\ref{hysteriaandhypnosis:freudbreueronannao}--&gt;). Traumatic event or fantasies can leave a subject with memories that are unacceptable to the conscious awareness. The conscious awareness defends itself by suppressing the traumatic event in the unconscious by means of repression (see, e.g. *Introductory Lectures on Psychoanalysis*, p. 82, 94 also p. 438). This hypothesis is sometimes called the **psychodynamic hypothesis**.

2.	Second, psychoanalysis posits that there is a finite amount of psychic energy available to any given individual. This forms the **Economic hypothesis** of classical psychoanalysis (See Freud, *Introductory Lectures*, p. 26 and 436-7 for the thesis that psychic energy is sexual; p. 340, 442-3 and 466for an explicit statement. It also appears in *On the Interpretation Dreams*, Ch7). The activities of the mind are “costly,” and hence the mind will optimize its function for the most efficient option.

3.	The **topographical hypothesis** is Freud's most well known:  the mind composed of three basic kinds of thoughts: conscious thoughts, pre-conscious thoughts and unconscious thoughts. The term 'thoughts' here is used broadly, to include wishes, desires, fears, emotions, etc. Conscious thoughts are those of which we are aware. Pre-conscious thoughts, are not currently conscious, but are readily available to consciousness. The memory of your last birthday, for example, is probably pre-conscious, not unconscious. Unconscious thoughts, which far outnumber the other two categories, are unavailable to consciousness. All these thoughts, however, originate in experience: there is nothing in the unconscious store that is not linked in some way to that individual's past experiences. (see, e.g. *Introductory lectures*, p. 25)

4.	Fourth, the **genetic hypothesis** claims that human behavior is best explained in terms of the original conditions that cause it. In Freud's theory, the genetic hypothesis takes the form of his theory of infantile sexuality.

For Freud, all behavior ultimately originates in sexual desire. To summarize briefly: Freud hypothesized that sexual drive, the main source of psychic energy, is present from birth. He is explicit in using the term 'sexual' here, but it is sometimes easier to understand if we use a softer term like 'using one's body for pleasure.' Freud repeated argues for infantile sexuality by pointing out the noncontroversial pleasure children take in tickling or cuddling, but we wouldn't necessarily call these 'sexual' today. Freud, somewhat to his determinate, insisted on the term 'sexual' even despite these kind of objections.

This drive towards physical gratification takes various forms throughout our lives, moving through the oral phase to the anal phase to the phallic stage. If the internal drives are left unfulfilled, or the internal conflicts unresolved (which is really two ways of saying the same thing), neurotic behavior results.

5.	Psychoanalysts differ with respect to the entities that comprise the mind, but most recognize Freud's basic **structural hypothesis**: the mind is functionally divided between the id, the ego and the superego (see *Introductory Lectures*, p. 365). The *id*, which is totally unconscious, contains the representations of sexual and aggressive instinctual drives. The *ego* regulates and controls the desires of the id in relation to the demands of the external world, which are internalized as the *superego*. The ego follows the **economic hypothesis**, in seeking to maximize gratification of the instinctual desires while minimizing the amount of psychic energy spent in that process. It achieves this end through the use of various mechanisms of representation and repression (sometimes called 'defense mechanisms'):

* **Repression**: The first mechanism proposed by Freud (Breuer and Freud), the ego banishes or precludes an idea or feeling from conscious awareness.
* **Isolation**: Ideas are split off from their associated feelings (affect) and presented as alien or foreign in origin.
* **Reaction formation**: replacing the unacceptable desire with its symbolic opposite.
* **Displacement**: unacceptable wishes are removed from their original objects and moved to an acceptable, or at least not-unacceptable one.
* **Projection**: an unacceptable idea or desire is attributed to someone else.
* **Undoing**: painful or unacceptable ideas are minimized by overdoing some opposite action in some opposite arena.
* **Turning against the self**:  the original object of an unpleasant desire (usually hate) is replaced with the self.
* **Denial**: the individual remains unaware of certain aspects of reality that would be painful to recognize.
* **Rationalization**: the individual convinces himself or herself that their behavior has a logical, reasonable, or at least neutral, explanation in order to avoid the unacceptable cause.
* **Identification**: usually found during development, a child becomes like another person (usually a parent) in order to deal with separation or loss of a love-object.

These conflicts can be discovered by studying the mechanisms of representation that are used to obfuscate and repress traumatic experiences and latent desires.  The mechanisms of representation take the object represented (the 'latent content') and replace it with a representation (the 'manifest content'). The relationship between these two can be one of:

* **part to whole**: the latent content is fragmented and represented in isolation. (*Introductory Lectures*, p. 147)
* **Allusion**: the latent content is represented by, in Freud's words “a caption, as it were, or an abbreviation in telegraphic style.” (*Introductory Lectures*, p. 148)
* **plastic portrayal**: the latent content is replaced with a plastic, concrete portrayal of it, taking its cue from the superficial aspects of the latent content. For example, the editor of a 'Survey' may be represented in a dream as a 'surveyor'. (*Introductory Lectures*, p.149)
* **Symbolism**: symbols are stable translations of one object into another. The relation between the object symbolized (the latent content) and the object that does the symbolization (the manifest content) is stable in an individual, but may not be stable between individuals. But it is always true that the latent content and manifest content share something in common. It is the task of the psychoanalysts, through the techniques of free association and manipulating transference reactions, to discover the common factors between the latent and manifest content, and hence reveal the symbolic relationships. (*Introductory Lectures*, p. 185)
	(see *Introductory lectures on psychoanalysis*,  Lecture VII-X)

By revealing these relationships to the subject of psychoanalysis, the ego becomes aware of latent trauma and hence can deal with it in healthy ways, removing the conflict and obviating the neurosis.

Interpsychic conflict is a part of the normal maturation of a healthy adult mind. Neurosis and Psychosis occur, therefore, when this development goes wrong in some important way. Development can go awry through *inhibition* or *regression* (see *Introductory Lectures*, Ch 22-23).  In 'inhibition', portions of function of the ego are held back from development, often because it becomes *fixated* on a particular libidnal instinct.  In 'regression' an ego that has progressed further than a given developmental stage returns to that stage was a kind of defense mechanism.

The terms 'neurosis' and 'psychoneurosis':

&gt; “refer to a class of psychiatric illnesses characterized by prominent symptoms that have no significant somatic origin. The symptoms include disturbances of feelings (anxiety, depression, guilt), disturbances of thought (obsessions), and disturbances of behavior (compulsions and phobic inhibitions), all of which are experienced as alien to the comfort and well-being of the individual” (*American Handbook of Psychiatry*, p. 737-738)

Neurosis, then, is explained when the conflict between the desires of the id and the defense mechanisms of the ego go awry: (1) the ego's defense mechanism leaves the drive unfulfilled, (2) the defense mechanism imposes a disguised or symbolic form onto the original drive in order to hide it from the consciousness, and (3) the superego imposes some suffering as punishment for the self-denial, such a guilt.

Psychosis occurs when the id constructs its own reality and imposes it on the ego. The subject can no longer function in normal life—he or she may be beset by hallucinations, persistent delusions, wild mood swings, visual and auditory agnosia, amnesia, etc. It is worth noting that unlike *neuroses*, psychoses may be the result of organic brain syndromes or other physical conditions. Psychoses not associated with physical conditions include schizophrenia, affective disorders and other reactions.

As the id is the source of psychic energy, unacceptable drives using one of the mechanisms above will not remain repressed forever. As unacceptable drives gain in strength and threaten to reveal themselves, a number of reactions are possible (see *Introductory Lectures*, Ch. 19):

* **Anxiety reaction**: a chronic, free-floating anxiety which may have periods of acute anxiety. Typified by feelings of helplessness; although symptoms include phobias, obsessions, compulsions and depression. It is caused by the failure of all the defenses to keep the unacceptable instinctual drives in stable control. (*Introductory Lectures*, Ch. 25, p. 452)
* **phobic reaction**: typified by one or more prominent phobias: and extreme anxiety focused on an ordinary place, object or situation.  The mechanism of displacement moves the anxiety associated with the unacceptable drive to a neutral place, object or situation, which then is allowed to flourish unchecked by the defense mechanisms of the ego. (*Introductory Lectures*, p. 495-498)
* **conversion reaction**: what used to be called 'hysteria', it can manifest itself in many symptoms, including spasms, temporary paralysis, visual or auditory agnosia, weakness, shortness of breath, pains, etc. It results when the unacceptable instinctual drive is 'converted' into apparently physical symptoms. (*Introductory Lectures*, p. 485, 497-8)
* **obsessive-compulsive reaction**: the patient is troubled by persistent thoughts that are usually painful in nature. These obsessional thoughts interfere in some important way with the patient's ability to engage in a meaningful adult life: i.e. intellectually, sexually, socially or professionally. Anxiety at not following through on an obsessional thought, which often manifests as repeated actions regarding some mundane object, can be severe and often is only revealed by completion of the mundane task in question. (*Introductory Lectures*, Ch. 17)

As an example, classical psychoanalysis holds that obsessive-compulsive reaction can be traced to unresolved conflicts in the anal stage of development, where frustration at potty-training is turned into rage towards one's mother. That rage, in turn, is found to be unacceptable by the ego and repressed through one of the standard mechanisms creating obsessions with objects or scenarios that are symbolically linked to the original frustration. The particular object of obsession is essentially random, as the subject latches onto some mundane object present at the time of the frustration. The choice of obsessional object, however, can provide clues as to the true cause of the frustration, as it is invariably linked, through one of the mechanisms of representation, to the true object. The compulsive aspect of this conditions is an 'acceptable' outlet for the unacceptable rage towards one's mother.  Psychoanalysts go on to hold that obsessive-compulsive is often unconsciously aware of his or her rage and may take extreme steps to avoid losing control when provoked.  

###### Psychoanalytic Treatment

Psychoanalysis—the process of psychoanalytic treatment—aims at resolving unresolved conflicts that cause neurosis. The psychoanalyst seeks to align the psychic forces within the individual so that they are no longer in conflict. A psychoanalyst must keep all five psychoanalytic hypotheses—the topographical, dynamic, economy, genetic and structural—in mind during treatment, but in practice, tends to focus on one or two at a time.  

Classical psychoanalysis makes use of two basic techniques: free association and manipulating transference reactions. In **free association**, the psychoanalyst removes himself or herself from the patients line of sight (hence the standard couch with the psychoanalyst seated behind the patients' head), and asks the patient to say whatever comes to mind when prompted regardless of logic, order or social constraint. In a relaxed state, it is theorized, these free-associations will reveal the connections between ideas that, when analyzed, explain the relationships this particular patient uses to represent latent content with manifest content.

Freud is often naively criticized for insisting on universal symbolic relationships: cigars always represent penises, for example. But this simply isn't true: classical psychoanalysis is 'empirical' in the sense that there is nothing in the mind that was not put there from experience.  The symbolic relationships found in a patient have built up by that patient, based on his or her unique experiences. Where commonalities occur between patients, they are at the level of the language (i.e. symbolic relationships that originate from homophones in German would not be found in an English-speaking patient) or culture (i.e. shared mythology). So while a cigar may represent a penis because of its shape to some, it may represent excrement because of its color to others.

**Transference** reactions are inappropriate reactions in which the patient reacts to a person or object in the present as if it were a person or object from the past (see *Introductory Lectures*, Ch. 27). Transference is, in Freud's terms, a 'repetition,' a reliving of an event, relationship, emotion, attitude, etc. with a substitute person or object. Transference can be a very powerful tool for the psychoanalyst, especially when the object that is the source of the unresolved conflict can be projected onto a substitute, and the patient allowed to address the object directly. If a patient's neurosis originates in unresolved anger towards his dead father, substituting a inanimate object for that father can allow the patient to exorcise the anger and hence dissolve the neurosis. Since Freud's masterwork *Dora*, many psychoanalysts have held transference to be the primary tool of psychoanalysis.

In order for transference to work, however, the patient must be willing and capable of suspending his or her 'ego' and regressing to the state where he or she really believes that the substitute is the original source of the conflict. As psychotics live in a state where experienced reality is formed by the psychic desire not reality itself; psychotics are not suitable candidates for treatment via transference.

Throughout treatment, the psychoanalysts must be aware of **resistance**.  Resistance is the patient's opposition to treatment. It defends the status quo by maintaining the neurosis or psychosis. Resistance may be conscious, subconscious or pre-conscious. It may hinder or misdirect free association. It may distract via inappropriate and unhelpful transference reactions. It may adapt to novel situations and invent new strategies. As Freud himself said “The resistance accompanies the treatment step by step. Every single association, every act of the person under treatment must reckon with the resistance and represents a compromise between the forces that are striving towards recovery and the opposing ones.” (1912, p. 11).

The psychoanalytic treatment can then be broken down into four basic steps:

* **Confrontation**: The first step in psychoanalysis: the patient's conscious ego must be made aware that there is a problem.  

* **Clarification**: The problem is put into sharp focus. Often, this process works with the previous, as minor conflicts give way to greater conflicts.

* **Interpretation**: The process of bringing the unconscious conflict into consciousness.

* **Working through**: the progressive elaboration of resistance mechanisms as they manifest.

There are, of course, many more complications that occur in any single patient's psychoanalytic treatment, but these four basic steps are almost universally recognized.

When embarking on a new treatment, then, the psychoanalyst has three basic aims:

1. To translate the productions of the patient into their unconscious antecedents. The patient's thoughts, fantasies, feelings, behavior, and impulses have to be traced to their unconscious predecessors.

2. The unconscious elements must be synthesized into meaningful insights. Fragments of past and present history, conscious and unconscious, must be connected so as to give a sense of continuity and coherence in terms of the patient's life.

3. The insight so obtained must be communicable to the patient. As one listens one must ascertain what uncovered material will be constructively utilizable by the patient. (quoting from the \emph{American Handbook of Psychiatry}, p. 779)


###### Jung

Jungian psychoanalysis is distinguished from classical psychoanalysis by two major shifts in the basic theory.

First, Jungian psychoanalysis holds that the subconscious contains psychical elements that do not originate in the experiences of the individual being psychoanalyzed.  As mentioned previously, classical psychoanalysis is empirical about the mind (for an explanation of that tradition, see &lt;!--\ref{pre-historyofpsychology:empiricismaboutthemind}--&gt;), holding that the mind comes into the world as a blank slate (tabla rasa), and is progressively filled by experiences. The contents of the unconscious must therefore be traceable to discrete experiences in the individual's life. And it is the task of psychoanalysis to discover those experiences.  

Jungian psychoanalysts believe they have evidence of unconscious contents that are not explainable by the experiences of the individual. Thus, they hypothesize the existence of a deeper 'collective unconscious' that is composed of 'archetypes' that inform and structure the content of both the unconscious as well as our conscious lives.

Second, on a related note, Jungian psychoanalysis extends the *genetic hypothesis* from Freud's insistence that all psychic energy was sexual energy to include sexual energy as just one of many sources of psychic energy.

For example, Freud originally posited that neurosis originated in traumatic experience in childhood on the basis of self-reports of his case-study patients. He ultimately came to realize, however, that these self-reports were fictionalizations, theorizing that the  true cause of his patient's neurosis lay in their infantile fixations. Once again, Jung extends Freud's insight to allow for fixations throughout life. He argues that:

&gt;	..the moment of the outbreak of neurosis is not just a matter of chance; as a rule it is most critical. It is usually *the moment when a new psychological adjustment, that is, a new adaptation, is demanded*. Such moments facilitate the outbreak of a neurosis, as every experienced neurologist knows.

 &gt; This fact seems to me extremely significant. If the fixation were indeed real we should expect to find its influence constant: in other words, a neurosis lasting throughout life. This is obviously not the case. The psychological determination of a neurosis is only partly due to an early infantile predisposition; it must be due to some cause in the present as well. (*The Essential Jung*, 49 “Psychoanalysis and Neurosis”)

That leads to the general proposition that Freud's identification of sexual desire as *the* origin of neurosis was far too narrow. Sexual desire is one of the pleasurable instincts that shape our psychology, but for Jung, “psychoanalytic theory should be freed from the purely sexual standpoint. In place of it I should like to introduce an *energetic viewpoint* into the psychology of neurosis” (ibid, p. 50).

Jung hypothesizes that the libidinal energies naturally increased when faced with an obstacle, in order to overcome it through adaptation. When that obstacle is too great, the libido retreats and regresses, and the patient reverts to a more primitive “mode of adaptation.” The practice of psychoanalysis is the same, however, as Jung theorizes that the energy that the patient needs to overcome the present obstacle and become healthy is attached to these sexual fixations. By bringing past frustrations and maladaptations to light through psychoanalysis, the libidinal energy is free to return to the present-day task: adaptation to overcome the current obstacle.

The task of a psychoanalyst, then, is not only to discover the original traumatic cause of a neurosis, probably buried deep in childhood, but to discover the current obstacle that is perceived as being insurmountable. Jung agrees with Freud that the childhood fixations determine the *form* of neurosis, but unlike Freud holds that they cannot be considered the *immediate cause* of neurosis.

The difference between practice among the psychoanalytic approaches is emphasis, not technique. As J.B. Wheelwright noted in 1963, “Freud focused on sexuality, Adler focused on power, and Jung focused on growth, which he called individuation.” (quoted in *American Handbook of Psychiatry*, p. 817)

            <Comments>'Neurotic' behavior results from continuing conflict between the libinal desires and the ego's repression techniques. 'Psychotic' behaviors result when the libinal desires assert their reality on the ego. See the discussion of 'neurosis' and 'psychosis' in the History of the Classification of Mental Illness section below.
The Introductory Lectures were published before Freud solidified the structural hypothesis using this terminology.  The beginnings of the idea, however, is present in the later chapters on neurosis: see, e.g. p. 437-438, where he describes the conflict between the 'libido' and the 'ego'.
The Introductory Lectures mention only repression, subdivided into 'condensation' and 'displacement' as mechanisms of the ego, but promises further work on the topic (p. 364-366). He began to develop a taxonomy of ego mechanisms later in his life, but the full-fledged taxonomy we see here was developed his daughter Anna Freud (1936). The Ego and and the Mechanisms of Defense. C. Baines (trans). Connecticut: International University Press.
In many works, including Psychopathology in Everyday Life, Introductory Lectures on Psychoanalysis and On the Interpretation of Dream, Freud provides the following outline of the kinds of commonality that underly symbolism: that of number (i.e. '3' and male genitalia), shape (i.e. long, straight objects such as sticks, umbrellas, posts, trees represent the male organ / hollowness or enclosing space such as vessels, bottles, boxes, trunks and ships symbolize female genitals; apples, peaches and fruit symbolize breasts), function (i.e. penetrating the body: knives, daggers, spears, sabers, firearms, rifles, pistols etc.; producing liquids, such as water-taps, water-cans, etc.; and being capable of lengthening or shortening, such as pencils, hanging-lamps, etc.; defying gravity (i.e. balloons, flying machines and zeppelins also represent the male organ). More complicated representations depend on personal associations with or reactions to objects: the complicated nature of landscapes mean they represent female bodies, sweets represent sexual satisfaction. Activities such as playing games, playing piano, sliding, gliding or pulling stand for masturbation because of the similarity of action. On the same note, rhythmic actions such as dancing, riding and climbing stand in for the sex act itself. Simple associations may appear as well: neckties, which are only worn by men, can symbolize men. (Introductory Lectures, p. 188-204)

see 295-299 of the DSM II
See item 300 in the DSM II for the full taxonomy of neurosis.
There is something of a controversy over whether psychoanalysis can be used to treat psychosis. While many psychoanalysts believe psychosis and neurosis to be on a single spectrum of mental dysfunction, the psychotic patient's connection to reality is so tenuous that the techniques of free-association and transference threaten to develop the psychosis further, rather than dissolve it.
In Aristotlean metaphysics, the *formal* cause of something is the form of the thing whereas the immediate cause are the events that immediately proceeded the thing in question.  The *form* is the pattern or type of thing something is. The immediate cause is what brings that thing into being. In this context, the *form* distinguishes the type of neurosis, the immediate cause is what caused the neurosis to present at this moment.</Comments>

            <Text>## D. Fordney Settlage, MD
### Your Biography
You were born in 1940. You became an American physician and sex therapist best known for your work on sexual function and dysfunction. Your BS is from the University of Arizona (1960) and your  MD (1964) from University of California at Los Angeles.

You began your career looking at sperm motility after intercourse, but you've also been interested in the sexual experiences among teenaged girls.

You are currently working on a comprehensive overview of heterosexual dysfunction. You served as Assistant Professor, Obstetrics and Gynecology Division of Reproductive Biology at the Los Angeles County-USC Medical Center.

You were an early critic of gynecologist James C. Burt, sometimes called the 'Love Surgeon' and his involuntary surgeries on the vulvas of patients. Burt performed a number of reconstructive surgeries (perhaps hundreds) on women who had recently given birth, when they were still under the effects of episiotomy.  In his words 'Women are structurally inadequate for intercourse. This is a pathological condition amenable to surgery.'' In franker terms, he also said that his surgery would turn women into ''horny little mice'' and asserted that ''the difference between rape and rapture is salesmanship.'' (1957, quoted in a 1988 NY Times article following his censorship by the Ohio Medical Board). You, as D. Fordney-Settlage has said, "Dr. Burt is a nice person but he is a zealot and that makes him dangerous."

During your tenure at the University of Arizona Medical Center’s fertility clinic, you assisted in helping hundreds of couples with fertility issues bring babies to term. During the course of your career, a debate ensued as to whether the availability of contraceptives was promoting pre-marital sex.

You conducted a study of 500 unwed teenage girls (aged 13-17) that had sought professional help in obtaining contraceptives. Your findings provided sound grounds to conclude that not only did the availability of contraceptives fail in promoting sexual behavior, but that a lack of contraceptive availability would not deter teenage girls from participating in sexual behavior. The study demonstrated the sexual behavior in teenage girls pre-dated the use of contraceptives, and that when available, teenage girls would make use of such options in order to prevent unwanted pregnancy, impediments to future and current education, forced marriage, illegitimacy, and abortion.

### Game Objectives

You primary objective is to get on the Spitzer taskforce to advocate for psychosexual disorders in the new taxonomy. Make certain that female sexuality is not maligned as a psychological disorder in the DSM-III or the definition of 'mental health.'  Your secondary objective is to advocate for women's sexual health more broadly.  You have a long-standing friendship with both Richard Green and Harold Lief.

There is very little research on women's sexuality. Kinsey's famous study causes a good deal of consternation. Even today, the issue of homosexuality seems largely to be about male homosexuality, with lesbianism hardly mentioned as an afterthought. Work with Leona Tyler in her efforts to get a Committee on Women in Psychology, and more importantly for you, the Committee on the Psychology of Women.

The issue of female sexuality has become particularly hot recently with the popularization of oral contraceptives.  While most people favor contraceptives for women who are already sexually active, there is a great controversy over whether allowing young women access to contraceptives will make  sexually active. You are interested in settling that question.

You are neutral on the definition of mental illness, so long as it isn’t gendered in some tacit way.

#### Specific Assignments

In 1972, propose to the research committee a study on the sexual experiences of younger women who are seeking contraceptives for the first time, based on her actual 1973 paper.  

As you straddle the fence between the MD and PhDs, the Medical doctors and the Psychologists, you are in the unique position to create a compromise between Albee and _____ regarding the rights and duties of the psychologists and psychiatrists in the treatment of patients in 1972.

In 1975, give a paper critiquing the history of psychiatric and psychological theory of sexuality as overly focused on male sexuality. You should be specific here – the game book appendicies contain the small amount of work by Freud on Lesbianism, and Krafft-Ebbing's Psychopathia Sexualis contains a brief mention at the very end.  Jung's theories of female homosexuality are worth exploring as well.  Consider how 'normal' sexual maturation has been defined in male terms, and how the explanations are inequal (i.e. compare the 'Oedipal complex' to the 'Electra complex'). This will take some work. Be specific and as thorough as you can – it will be important to consider as the DSM-III is considered.

            <Text>## Jean Piaget, PhD
### Your Biography

You were born in 1896 in Switzerland to Arthur Piaget, a professor of medieval literature at Neuchâtel University. You write, late in life, that you Mother's poor mental health 'intensly interested' in questions of psychology and psychoanalysis. This interest did not manifest at first, however, as your first passion was natural history. Many commentators have asserted this interest was born of an aversion to anything fantastical or hallucinatory. At the age of 11, you started to work with Paul Godet, Director of the Natural History Museum at Neuchâtel, on molluscs.  This work was so successful that when you were only 15, Maurice Bedot, director of the Natural History Museum at Geneva, offered you a position as an assistant in malacology.  You declined, explaining that you were too young.

You went to the University of Neuchâtel to study natural sciences, but happened upon a series of lectures by Carl Jung while spending a semester at the University of Zurich. After completing your Doctorate, you took a job teaching at a boy's school in France established by the psychologist  Alfred Binet.  It was there that you began seriously investigating child development.

Given your training and interest in natural science, you approached the problem of developmental psychology experimentally, testing the problem-solving skills of children of different ages. You concluded, after much observation, that the thinking structures of children differ from adults, and develop during different stages of the child's development.  That basic idea is core to all your theories of psychology.

You returned to Switzerland in 1921 as Director of the Rousseau Institute in Geneva. You married Valentie Châtenay in 1923, with whom you had three children: Jacqueline, Lucienne and Laurent.  

By carefully interviewing them (in a quasi-clinical setting) while they tried to solve problems you had set up, you developed your idea of 'genetic epistemology,' reflecting your emphasis on the origin of knowledge in development.  You theorize that the human mind has certain cognitive structures that correspond to different stages of development: sensorimotor, preoperational, concrete operational, and formal operational.  Contrary to the behaviorists, you do not believe that all learning is a matter of conditioning.  But at the same time, contrary to Descartes and the Port-Royalists, you don't believe it is innate either.  

According to you, children understands his or her world by adapting to new conditions and information using two basic ways: assimilation and accommodation.  'Assimilation' refers to the child's ability to fit current experiences into an existing conceptual structure, and 'accommodation' when the child has to create a new conceptual structure to understand new information. Understanding the psychology of a child, or a person, requires that we understand the cognitive structures he or she uses to understand his or her world.

Your view provides something of a counterpoint to the Freudian view of child development. While you both hold that the child psychology develops through a series of stages, you do not believe that the cognitive structures found in an adult would be found in a child.  It follows then that even if children engage in behaviors that adults would understand in a certain way (say, sexually), it does not mean that the child understands those behaviors in the same way. In fact, while you believe that psychoanalysis will not progress as a science until it unified its methodology to something more scientific (Freud never studied any actual children, for example), your main criticisms center around Freud's version of the genetic hypothesis. You share that criticism, of course, with Carl Jung.

### Game Objectives

You are something of an independent on most of the issues that come before the APA.  At this point in your career, you are an old man, considered to be one of the greats in the history of psychology.  On the other hand, the first behaviorist revolution saw members of your generation as the enemy. You are sympathetic to those challenging behaviorism, including the cognitivists. But you're also deeply concerned about the scientific validity of psychoanalysis.

Your specific task in this game is to engage the new revolutionaries—Chomsky in particular—in a public discussion or debate of the concept of 'innateness' in psychology, and the acceptability of positing innate ideas in a scientific enterprise. You should propose the event to the conference committee in time for it to happen in 1975.

As you will remember, the problem of innate ideas strikes the very core of the idea of the scientific study of the mind: the empirical hypothesis unifies the tradition as a whole, with the exception of Jungians. Moreover, the debate on homosexuality often turns, in the public mind at the least, on whether sexuality is innate (an 'orientation') or not (a 'preference').  The kind of innateness you and Chomsky are discussing is probably not the same, as you both agree that the structure of thought that is innate, not the content. This should be made clear in your public discussion.

Chomsky posits that the there is a innate system of grammars that are common to all humans, as a function of our biology. You believe there is a 'fixed nucleaus' of cognition that is innate, but say that “the functioning of intelligence alone is hereditary.”  The actual debate is recorded in Piatelli-Palmarini's 1980 book, which you should review during the course of the game.

You are neutral on the issue of the definition of mental illness.

            <Text>#### Major Events
The are three majors topics / events that every game should address. The first, demedicalization, is really a sample question to set up the major issues of the game.

1. **Demedicalization**

The demedlication of homosexuality is almost totally assured.  The only characters who argue against it are Bieber and Socarides. Their reliance on psychoanalytic techniques will not sway Marmor or Hopcke, who are committed to demedicalization.  This may be frustrating to your students.  It is wise to remind them that the main question of the game--the legitimacy of psychoanalysis as a scientific enterprise--is very much in play, and if they strategize correctly, they can win the game even though they lost the first battle.

 The NY Times obituary of Socarides quotes Gilbert Herdt of National Sexuality Resource Center in San Francisco as saying “Socarides outlived his time.” That is roughly correct. Many psychiatrists in 1971 may not have noticed that the medicalization of homosexuality was a problem for the homosexual community, but once it was pointed out, the opinion swung dramatically: 58% of the population approved of the demedicalization in 1973.  And today,  there is great embarrassment about that era. 

As such, the main debate here is about the procedure by which homosexuality will be removed. Green and Marmor will be tempted to just ram it through the board of directors without consulting the population.  That should be avoided.  I've set up the game so that Marmor's original proposal should be remanded to the nomenclature committee, which will report in 1972, requiring a final vote of the membership in 1973.  While the result is not in doubt, without that process, Socarides' rhetoric that the decision was political, not scientific, will be bolstered.

2. **DSM-III**

The second section of the game addresses the central question of the legitimacy of psychoanalysis. It does so, once again, tangentially by asking students to debate the evidence that should be used to form the taxonomy of mental illness as contained in the DSM-III. Students shouldn’t be debating whether this or that criteria is include, but rather, whether the DSM-III ought to be structured around the psychodynamic hypothesis or the careful study of observable symptoms. You could say the debate is whether mental illness is classified by its causes or its effects.

At the same time, the Spitzer taskforce should propose a covering definition of 'mental illness' that will directly challenge the views of Szasz and Albee.  It should fail (it did, in reality). 

3. **Fission**

Members of the factions have the option to form splinter associations. In reality:

* the behaviorists found the “Society for the Experimental Analysis of Behavior” (actual founding 1957), and found two journals: *Journal of the Experimental Analysis of Behavior and Journal of Applied Behavioral Analysis*. 
* Psychoanalysts form the American Psychoanalytic Association (actual founding in 1911, but grew rapidly in this era) and the journal *Journal of the American Psychoanalytic Association (JAPA)*, and 

* Cognitivists form the Cognitive Science Society (1979) and its associated journals. 

No students are given direct instruction on whether the fission requires withdrawal from the APA. Some, esp. those playing Beiber and Socarides, may feel stronger about the fission than the cognitivists Miller and Chomsky.  This is historically appropriate–by the mid-1980s, cognitivism generally dominated the APA.  And contemporary behaviorism has adapted to resemble cognitivism in many ways, by include talk of 'motivations' and of the 'function of behavior' in their explanations.

            <Text>## Cognitivist Overview

Cognitivist Psychology, and the affiliated disciplines that make up 'Cognitive Science': linguistics, computer science, philosophy and neuroscience, owe an intellectual and cultural debt to behaviorism. While many in the cognitivist community see themselves in the tradition of William James, John Dewey and the 'Chicago school,' most cognitivists were trained as behaviorists.  They do not differ with behaviorists with respect to the metaphysical thesis that the mind is physical. They differ on the basic object of study of psychology: the cognitivists hold that psychology is the study of the mind, not just behavior.

Theoretically, cognitivism marries information theory of computer science to psychology and neurobiology. It sees mental states and processes as informational states and processes which are realized in the computational 'hardware' of the brain. Thus, a proper explanation of psychology should not only describe the behavior of the organism, it should also explain the informational algorithm that drives that behavior, and the neurobiological states that implement the algorithm.

You are neutral on the issue of the definition of mental illness, but be ready to oppose any definition that is clearly behaviorist or psychoanalytic in nature.

            <Text>#### Behaviorists

Behaviorism holds that psychology is properly limited to the observation, prediction and control of behavior. It  typified by four hypotheses:

1. *Internal entities are neither the object of scientific study nor explanatorily relevant to psychology.* Behaviorism begins with the deceptively simply insight that while psychoanalytic explanations are framed in terms of psychic entities (ego, id, etc.), quantities (psychic energy) and interactions (the mechanisms of repression), what all psychological theories seek to explain is behavior. These psychic entities, and the massive vocabulary that is required to discuss them, are all hypothetical, posited for the sake of explaining why people behave the way they do. Moreover, psychoanalytic hypotheses require a sharp dividing line between human behavior and animal behavior, which is not born out by empirical observation.
To be scientific, then, psychology must limit itself to observable behavior. The discourse of psychology as a scientific discipline is restricted to those terms that denote observable variables: behavior and environmental conditions, not internal mental states. From characterizing the phenomenon to be studied to offering an explanation, the behaviorist is committed to avoiding all terms that denote entities, quantities or interactions that are internal or unobservable.
A corollary of the thesis, which is frequently highlighted as an independent claim, is that *introspection is not a scientific form of observation*. One might argue (as historical figures like William James and William Wundt did–see &lt;!--\ref{americanpsychology:williamjamesandthefunctionofconsciousness} and \ref{introspection:wundt}--&gt;) that internal states *are* scientifically observable via introspection.  Behaviorists, however, reject introspection as scientifically unreliable. Evidence from Wundt and James demonstrates, they argue, that introspective procedures produce different results for different practitioners, and scientific evidence should be replicable regardless of the practitioner.
Behaviorists disagree on whether internal mental states are non-existent fictions or merely unavailable to scientific inquiry; but that is not important here. What is important is that these putative internal mental states do not enter into the scientific study of behavior, or the scientific language that describes and explains behavior.

2.	*The proper object of study for psychology is the organism and its environment*. As a corollary of this insight, Behaviorists see behavior as the activity of an *organism*, not the activity of a *mind*. Psychology, for the behaviorist, is not the study of *parts* of an organism (such as the “ego,” “id,” and “superego”) and their relations, but rather the organism *as a whole* and its relationships with its environments.  And similarly, explanations offered by Behaviorists refer to organisms, behaviors and environmental conditions, not methods of repression and techniques of representation. Behaviorism restricts is object of study as well as its explanations to the macroscopic scale: things that can be directly observed by the naked eye. In the classical sense, Behaviorism rejects *as non-scientific* explanations in terms of or investigations into things that are larger (societies, cultures) or smaller (brains, neurons).
This thesis unites behaviorism with classical psychoanalysis in opposition to Jung, because it holds that all present behavior is the result of discrete learning events in the individual's past.   But unlike psychoanalytic explanations that posit unresolved psychic conflict to explain behavior, the behaviorist appeals only to previous learning experiences. To discover the reason for a given behavior then, is to discover the patterns of environmental reinforcement (called 'conditioning') that have caused the organism to learn this behavior. To cure a behavior is to 'extinguish' those conditioned responses in the organism or block those responses by substituting a new and novel response. Behaviorists hypothesize that learning can be physically realized in neurology, and hence, behaviorism is far more simple and plausible a theory than psychoanalysis, which cannot.

3.	*The principles of learning are generalizable across species.* Behaviorists argue that given that animals are incapable of introspection—or, if they are, they cannot communicate it—psychological theories that make use of introspection are incapable of explaining animal psychology.  Behaviorism, however, is not. Non-human animals are organisms living in environments that behave in certain regular ways. All of that is accessible to behavioristic science. And as it is an uncontroversial observation that at least some human behavior is the same as animal behavior (caring for the young, for example), it follows that behaviorism can explain regularities that introspective psychology cannot.

##### Learning

A behavioristic explanation of a given behavior takes the form of specifying the mechanism of learning that caused this behavior.  A behavioristic treatment seeks to 'extinguish' that behavior through providing an antithetical mechanism.

Learning mechanisms in behaviorism are built on the principles of reinforcement and extinction. Explanation of reinforcement and extinction are always specified in terms of stimulus and response. According to Watson, by 'stimulus' behaviorists “mean any object in the general environment or any change in the physiological condition of the animal, such as the change we get when we keep an animal from sex activity, when we keep it from feeding, when we keep it from building a nest.”  By 'response' behaviorists “mean that system of organized activity that we see emphasized anywhere in any kind of animal, as building a skyscraper, drawing plans, having babies, writing books, and the like.” (1929)

In recent years, B.F. Skinner has popularize operant conditioning and the idea of 'reinforcing' a behavior. Anything that increases the likelihood of a response given a stimulus is a *reinforcement*.  Positive reinforcement takes the form of adding some “rewarding” object to the environment when the desired response occurs.  “Negative” reinforcement usually means the removal of such objects.  Reinforcing objects need not be physical, tangible objects, but can something as intangible as the attention of a parent. “Punishment” is a negative condition applied to the organism following a behavior.

A decrease in the probability of a response given a stimulus over time is called *extinction*. In classical conditioning models of learning, the lack of repetitive exposure to reinforcement will result in progressive extinction of the conditioned response.

The mechanisms learning are:

* **Classical conditioning**, which is sometimes called 'past reinforcement,' occurs when an unconditioned stimulus, such as the presentation of food, causes an unconditioned ('natural') response, such as salivation. These 'natural' stimulus-response patterns are called “embryologic responses,” and they are raw material of a classical conditioning paradigm. In classical conditioning, the conditioning intervention in the embryological response occurs by pairing a 'conditioned stimulus' (such as the ringing of a bell) with the unconditioned stimulus. After repeated exposures, the original unconditioned response can be removed, and the response (now 'conditioned') will occur when the subject is presented with the conditioned stimulus. These basic pairings between conditioned stimuli and responses can be generalized over time, so that any loud noise, for example, may cause salivation.  

* **Operant conditioning** differs from classical conditioning insofar as the conditioning intervention occurs after the response, rather than concurrent with the unconditioned stimulus. Operant condition introduces the possibility of promised reinforcement, which would occur when the promise of future reinforcement causes behavior.

###### Behaviorism as a treatment in psychiatry

Behavioral treatments in psychiatry, like behaviorism in psychology, follows from a deceptively simple insight: that psychiatric treatment aims at the cessation of maladaptive behavior.  Like psychoanalysis, behavioral therapies restrict themselves to neurosis, not psychosis.

There are two major kinds of inhibition therapies found in the literature:

* **Reciprocal inhibition**, developed by Wolpe, involves diminishing the maladaptive behavior by conditioning a new behavior in response to a given stimulus that is incompatible with the undesired behavior. For reciprocal inhibition to work, the maladaptive behavior *must be* incompatible with the new conditioned behavior. Aversion therapy, which exposes the subject to the object of desire and conditions a new negative response, is a form of reciprocal inhibition.
* **Transmarginal inhibition**, also known as *flooding*, involves exposing the patient to strong examples of the stimuli for prolonged periods.

Other inhibition therapies, such as 'retroactive inhibition' are usually forms of reciprocal inhibition.

            <Comments>As with most things in the history of ideas, even this definition is controversial.  I've chosen this definition, which reflects Skinner's presentation of Behaviorism in his 1953 Science and Human Behavior, chapter 1 because it is the most explicit and radical.  Watson defines that the goal of behaviorism as the “prediction and control of behavior,” (1913) leaving out observation. To understand the various different forms of behaviorism that have been posited since Watson's, please see &lt;!--\ref{psychoanalysts}--&gt; on page &lt;!--\pageref{psychoanalysts}--&gt;.
See, for further explication of this claim, Skinner 1953, p. 27-31. Watson does not use the term 'inner state', but refers rather to 'consciousness', which he (possibly fallaciously) equates with the object of introspection. Thus, after objecting to the unreliability of introspective reports in a laboratory setting he claims “The time seems to have come when psychology must discard all references to consciousness; when it need no longer delude itself into thinking that it is making mental states the object of observation.”
Animals do not have superegos or techniques of repression, so the behaviors explained in psychoanalytic terms should not generalize across species. But they do. Therefore, psychoanalytic explanations are insufficient.
Watson seeks to eliminate the following misleading and unscientific terms from psychology: “consciousness, mental states, mind, content, introspectively verifiable, imagery, and the like.” (1913)
See, e.g. Watson 1913 “Introspection forms no essential part of its methods, nor is the scientific value of its data dependent upon the readiness with which they lend themselves to interpretation in terms of consciousness” and Skinner 1953 p. 30
Recall that Behaviorism was formed in the first half of the 20th century, when Hegelianism was a viable theory of social science. Behaviorists here are not rejecting the plausibility of modern social psychology, anthropology or sociology. They are rejecting the idea of a transcendent spirit that instantiates human culture.
See, e.g. Watson 1913 “The behaviorist, in his efforts to get a unitary scheme of animal response, recognizes no dividing line between man and brute.”

### Biography
You were born in Kentucky in 1938. You were an academically talented kid who entered Medical School at Vanderbilt at the age of 19. After completing your internship at Ohio State, you moved to Philadelphia, where you still live today.

You are often described as a “large” man, both in body and personality. While others describe you as “flamboyant” and “outspoken,” you prefer “farm boy.”  But you recognize that you can be combative and gruff in pursuit of your ideals. These attributes have not always made your life easy, especially since you are gay.  You were forced to leave the University of Pennsylvania's psychiatry residency program when your sexual orientation was discovered (recall that mentally ill people cannot practice psychiatry), but were able to complete your certification at Norristown State Hospital in Philadelphia.

You eventually were hired into the psychiatric department of the hospital of Temple University, where you remain. Talented in multiple things, you serve as the organist for St. Peter's Episcopal Church in Germantown, the neighborhood of Philadelphia where you live.

You are also a member of the secret organization of gay psychiatrists who quietly met at APA meetings, known unofficially as the “Gay-PA.”
### Game Objectives

Calling yourself 'Dr. H. Anonymous', give a talk entitled “I am a homosexual, and a psychiatrist.” during the 1971 panel discussion “Psychiatry: Friend or Foe to Homosexuals: A Dialogue” wearing a mask. The mask is really a bit of theater – everyone who matters knows who you really are. But you're making a point: that mentally ill people cannot practice psychiatry. And as homosexuality is classified as a mental illness, so technically, homosexuals should not be allowed to practice psychiatry. But they do – many homosexuals are very good psychiatrists, including yourself. It follows, therefore, that the classification is not only unhelpful to homosexuals themselves, it is actually harming the discipline of psychiatry.

The text of Dr. H. Anonymous' speech was widely available on the internet, but as of Feb, 2011, it appears to have been removed. I'll included it below, but it is important that your speech models the original, not replicates it. You need to write this in your own words, but making arguments that are along the same lines as the original.

Work with your fellow Gay-PA members to remove 'homosexuality' from the DSM and opposing any attempt to reintroduce any substitute classification.

In 1974, propose that the deem ban the use of aversion therapy in the treatment of homosexuality immoral.  You should research some of the first-hand stories available on http://www.treatmentshomosexuality.org.uk/ to make your case.

You are neutral on the definition of mental illness. 

### Must Read

Dr. H. Anonymous speech:

&gt; "Thank you, Dr. Robinson. I am a homosexual. I am a psychiatrist. I, like most of you in this room, am a member of the APA and am proud to be a member. However, tonight I am, insofar as in it is possible, a ‘we.’ I attempt tonight to speak for many of my fellow gay members of the APA as well as for myself. When we gather at these conventions, we have a group, which we have glibly come to call the Gay-PA. And several of us feel that it is time that real flesh and blood stand up before you and ask to be listened to and understood insofar as that is possible. I am disguised tonight in order that I might speak freely without conjuring up too much regard on your part about the particular WHO I happen to be. I do that mostly for your protection. I can assure you that I could be any one of more than a hundred psychiatrists registered at this convention. And the curious among you should cease attempting to figure out who I am and listen to what I say.

&gt; "We homosexual psychiatrists must persistently deal with a variety of what we shall call ‘Nigger Syndromes.’ We shall describe some of them and how they make us feel.

&gt; "As psychiatrists who are homosexual, we must know our place and what we must do to be successful. If our goal is academic appointment, a level of earning capacity equal to our fellows, or admission to a psychoanalytic institute, we must make certain that no one in a position of power is aware of our sexual orientation or gender identity. Much like the black man with the light skin who chooses to live as a white man, we cannot be seen with our real friends - our real homosexual family - lest our secret be known and our dooms sealed. There are practicing psychoanalysts among us who have completed their training analysis without mentioning their homosexuality to their analysts. Those who are willing to speak up openly will do so only if they have nothing to lose, then they won’t be listened to.

&gt; "As psychiatrists who are homosexuals, we must look carefully at the power which lies in our hands to define the health of others around us. In particular, we should have clearly in our minds, our own particular understanding of what it is to be a healthy homosexual in a world, which sees that appellation as an impossible oxymoron. One cannot be healthy and be homosexual, they say. One result of being psychiatrists who are homosexual is that we are required to be more healthy than our heterosexual counterparts. We have to make some sort of attempt through therapy or analysis to work problems out. Many of us who make that effort are still left with a sense of failure and of persistence of "the problem." Just as the black man must be a super person, so must we, in order to face those among our colleagues who know we are gay. We could continue to cite examples of this sort of situation for the remainder of the night. It would be useful, however, if we could now look at the reverse.

&gt; "What is it like to be a homosexual who is also a psychiatrist? Most of us Gay-PA members do not wear our badges into the Bayou Landing [a gay bar in Dallas] or the local Canal Baths. If we did, we could risk the derision of all the non-psychiatrist homosexuals. There is much negative feeling in the homosexual community towards psychiatrists. And those of us who are visible are the easiest targets from which the angry can vent their wrath. Beyond that, in our own hometowns, the chances are that in any gathering of homosexuals, there is likely to be any number of patients or paraprofessional employees who might try to hurt us professionally in a larger community if those communities enable them to hurt us that way.

&gt; "Finally, as homosexual psychiatrists, we seem to present a unique ability to marry ourselves to institutions rather than wives or lovers. Many of us work 20 hours daily to protect institutions that would literally chew us up and spit us out if they knew the truth. These are our feelings, and like any set of feelings, they have value insofar as they move us toward concrete action.

&gt; "Here, I will speak primarily to the other members of the Gay-PA who are present, not in costume tonight. Perhaps you can help your fellow psychiatrist friends understand what I am saying. When you are with professionals, fellow professionals, fellow psychiatrists who are denigrating the "faggots" and the "queers," don’t just stand back, but don’t give up your careers, either. Show a little creative ingenuity; make sure you let your associates know that they have a few issues that they have to think through again. When fellow homosexuals come to you for treatment, don’t let your own problems get in your way, but develop creative ways to let the patient know that they’re all right. And teach them everything they need to know. Refer them to other sources of information with basic differences from your own so that the homosexual will be freely able to make his own choices.

&gt; "Finally, pull up your courage by your bootstraps, and discover ways in which you and homosexual psychiatrists can be closely involved in movements which attempt to change the attitudes of heterosexuals - and homosexuals - toward homosexuality. For all of us have something to lose. We may not be considered for that professorship. The analyst down the street may stop referring us his overflow. Our supervisor may ask us to take a leave of absence. We are taking an even bigger risk, however, not accepting fully our own humanity, with all of the lessons it has to teach all the other humans around us and ourselves. This is the greatest loss: our honest humanity. And that loss leads all those others around us to lose that little bit of their humanity as well. For, if they were truly comfortable with their own homosexuality, then they could be comfortable with ours. We must use our skills and wisdom to help them - and us - grow to be comfortable with that little piece of humanity called homosexuality."

### Your Biography

You are Leona Tyler, Psychologist.

You were born in Chetek, Wisconsin in 1906. When you were a child, your family moved to Mesabi Iron Range in Minnesota, where you would live until college.

You originally studied English literature as an undergraduate. You met the applied psychologist D.G. Paterson and started a PhD In Psychology at the University of Minnesota.  In 1940, as ABD, you was appointed the head of the Personnel Research Bureau at the University of Oregon. After WWII, you established a veteran’s counseling service funded by the VA at U Oregon. In 1951-52, you traveled to Maudsley Hospital in England to work with the Psychiatrist Hans Eysenck. And in 1962-63, you held a Fulbright in Amsterdam.


In 1947, building on your experience at the University of Oregon, you published The Psychology of Human Differences. Still a classic of counseling, in it you suggest that the best way to understand individuals in counseling session is to see them as making choices between an infinite array of possible alternatives. You do not have a taste for theoretical bickering. As a counselor, you take a pragmatic approach to theoretical issues, but various commentators have noticed your similarity to theories of Piaget, Carl Rogers, Erik Erikson and others.  Your practice blends psychoanalytic, behavioral and cognitive therapies.

The primary focus of your work is 'individuality,' not in a philosophical or moral sense, but in the sense that you reject the idea that an individual personality can be represented as a profile of scores in an n-dimensional space. On the contrary, you argue that an individual personality can be best described by the series of choices that that individual has made. It is possible, you hypothesize, to identify patterns in choice-making behavior. Your 'Choice Pattern Technique,' which asks people to choose and sort cards representing careers and leisure-time activities, is still widely used by psychological and career counselors today.

In recent years, however, you have come to theorize that in order to make choices, an individual must be able to represent possible courses of actions or states of affairs that are not actual (i.e. possible but not currently real). At times, the internal representations discussed by these new 'Cognitive Scientists' like Chomsky and Miller, sound very similar to your hypothetical structures. But you're not willing to give up the obvious successes of behavioral therapy.

 To understand an individual, then, we must understand both that the individuals' cognitive / representational abilities and their patterns of choosing between possibilities to make them actual.
### Game Objectives

As an initial member of the Research committee, you'll be called upon to judge the scientific legitimacy and ethical acceptability of proposed research programs.  You should make yourself familiar with the sections of the game book titled 'A Primer on Research Methods' and 'Ethics of Human Research'.  Your gamemaster will give you an additional sheet outlining the responsibilities of members of the research committee in evaluating proposals.

Notice that the official documents of the APA, as included in the game book, are written in gender-specific language: I.B states “a nonmember of the APA may read a paper provided that he is sponsored...”. The implication here is, of course, that a female nonmember is not allowed to present. As this document is an official representation of the policies of the APA, it should be clarified to reflect the policies of the organization. You should make those proposals in 1973.

If you become president, it is almost certain that there will be a number of proposed proclamations on the table.  You should insist on the following the 'advocacy' principle. If you can make it policy, so much the better:

&gt;As citizens, members of the APA have the right to advocate for any cause through the myriad of political advocacy organizations, but when psychologists and psychiatrists speak for the profession through APA public stances and proclamations, it should be from science and professional experience.

&gt;On occasion psychiatrists are asked for an opinion about an individual who is in the light of public attention or who has disclosed information about himself/herself through public media. In such circumstances, a psychiatrist may share with the public his or her expertise about psychiatric issues in general. However, it is unethical for a psychiatrist to offer a professional opinion unless he or she has conducted an examination and has been granted proper authorization for such a statement.

You can split these two paragraphs into two proposals, if you believe it will be easier to pass them. The second is a direct result of the Goldwater affair (see the gamebook &lt;!--\fullref{playingapsychologistorpsychiatristinthe1970s}--&gt;, and anticipates the problems associated with the APA’s stand on abortion in 1970s:

In 1969, the American Psychological Association issued a public proclamation, citing lack of evidence to the contrary that:

&gt; **WHEREAS** in many state legislature, bills have recently been introduced for the purpose of repealing or drastically modifying the existing criminal codes with respect to the termination of unwanted pregnancies; and whereas, termination of unwanted pregnancies is clearly a mental health and child welfare issue, and a legitimate concern of APA; be it resolved, that termination of pregnancy be considered a civil right of the pregnant woman, to be handled as other medical and surgical procedures in consultation with her physician, and to be considered legal if performed by a licensed physician in a licensed medical facility.⁠ (Available at http://www.apa.org/about/governance/council/policy/abortion.aspx)


The American Psychiatric Association followed in 1977 with:

&gt;The emotional consequences of unwanted pregnancy on parents and their offspring may lead to long-standing life distress and disability, and the children of unwanted pregnancies are at high risk for abuse, neglect, mental illness, and deprivation of the quality of life. Pregnancy that results from undue coercion, rape, or incest creates even greater potential distress or disability in the child and the parents. The adolescent most vulnerable to early pregnancy is the product of adverse sociocultural conditions involving poverty, discrimination, and family disorganization, and statistics indicate that the resulting pregnancy is laden with medical complications which threaten the well-being of mother and fetus. The delivery that ensues from teenage pregnancy is prone to prematurity and major threats to the health of mother and child, and the resulting newborns have a higher percentage of birth defects, developmental difficulties, and a poorer life and health expectancy than the average for our society. Such children are often not released for adoption and thus get caught in the web of foster care and welfare systems, possibly entering lifetimes of dependency and costly social interventions. The tendency of this pattern to pass from generation to generation is very marked and thus serves to perpetuate a cycle of social and educational failure, mental and physical illness, and serious delinquency.

&gt;Because of these considerations, and in the interest of public welfare, the American Psychiatric Association

&gt;1)	opposes all constitutional amendments, legislation, and regulations curtailing family planning and abortion services to any segment of the population; 2) reaffirms its position that abortion is a medical procedure in which physicians should respect the patient's right to freedom of choice - psychiatrists may be called on as consultants to the patient or physician in those cases in which the patient or physician requests such consultation to expand mutual appreciation of motivation and consequences; and 3) affirms that the freedom to act to interrupt pregnancy must be considered a mental health imperative with major social and mental health implications.⁠ (Available at http://www.psych.org/Departments/EDU/Library/APAOfficialDocumentsandRelated/PositionStatements/197703.aspx)

You'll recall that the US Supreme court decided that abortion was covered by the constitutional dictate to a 'right to privacy,' thereby blocking all laws that had kept abortion illegal.


You can mine the history of both of these issues for arguments in favor of your proposal. You should also look at Principle 5 of the APA Ethical Standards of Psychologists for support.

You should organize your efforts on these manners with the other women in the organization. As you'll notice from the brief history in the gamebook, the APA had women members since its second year of existence, and Mary Whiton Calkins was a president in its 12th year (1905).  There has not, however, been a women in a leadership position since that time.  You are a serious candidate to be the first woman president in over 50 years.

You are neutral on the issue of the definition of mental illness, so long as it is clearly not gendered in any way.

#### Specific Assignments

You should present a paper introducing your view of counseling and a 'hopeful' psychology (based on your actual 1973 presidential address) whether or not you are elected president. If elected president, this should be your presidential address. If not, you'll have to propose it as a conference paper to the Program committee.

            <Comments>Many of the first-person stories on the 'treatments' of homosexuality that are collected at http://treatmentshomosexuality.org.uk/ come from Maudsley.
In 1964, a magazine called Fact asked 12,000 psychiatrists if they would be willing to diagnose conservative presidential candidate Barry Goldwater. Of the more than 2000 that responded 1,189 responded that he appeared to have a 'personality disorder'--that slippery category between psychosis and neurosis.  The headline proclaimed (under the magazine's title 'fact:') that “1,198 Psychiatrists Say Goldwater Is Psychologically Unfit To Be President! You may recall that the 1964 election witnessed Johnson's famous 'Daisy' ad, which suggested that the election of Barry Goldwater would lead to nuclear annihilation.⁠1

Approved by the Board of Trustees, December 1973 Approved by the Assembly, 1973
WHEREAS HOMOSEXUALITY per se implies no impairment in judgment, stability, reliability, or general social or vocational capabilities, therefore, be it resolved that the American Psychiatric Association deplores all public and private discrimination against homosexuals in such areas as employment, housing, public accommodation, and licensing, and declares that no burden of proof of such judgment, capacity, or reliability shall be placed upon homosexuals greater than that imposed on any other persons. Further, the American Psychiatric Association supports and urges the enactment of civil rights legislation at the local, state, and federal level that would offer homosexual citizens the same protections now guaranteed to others on the basis of race, creed, color, etc. Further, the American Psychiatric Association supports and urges the repeal of all discriminatory legislation singling out homosexual acts by consenting adults in private.
(The American Psychiatric Association is, of course, aware that many other persons in addition to homosexuals are irrationally denied their civil rights on the basis of pejorative connotations derived from diagnostic or descriptive terminology used in psychiatry and deplores all such discrimination. This resolution singles out discrimination against homosexuals only because of the pervasive discriminatory acts directed against this group and the arbitrary and discriminatory laws directed against homosexual behavior).
This statement was prepared by Robert L. Spitzer, M.D., with the approval of the Task Force on Nomenclature and Statistics and was recommended for approval by the Council on Professions and Association.

#### Learning Objectives

In many ways, this is not a game about Psychology or Psychiatry, it is a game about the Philosophy of Science. This shouldn't really be surprising, as the history of the Psychology and Psychiatry is intimately linked to the history of the Philosophy of Science. Arguments made by Wundt, Freud, Watson, Hull Skinner and Miller all rely heavily on claims regarding what is or is not a legitimate scientific claim. This issues has not disappeared from undergraduate Psychological classroom either.  The APA's current guidelines for the Undergraduate Major in Psychology, published 2010, lists 10 learning outcomes for a major. The first is:



	&gt; Goal 1: Knowledge Base of Psychology

&gt; Demonstrate familiarity with the major concepts, theoretical perspectives, empirical findings, and historical trends in psychology

	&gt; Suggested Learning Outcomes

  1.1.	Characterize the nature of psychology as a discipline

  a)	Explain why psychology is a science.

  b)	Identify and explain the primary objectives of psychology: describing, understanding, predicting, and controlling behavior and mental processes.

  c)	Compare and contrast the assumptions and methods of psychology with those of other disciplines

  d)	Describe the contributions of psychology perspectives to interdisciplinary collaboration.

If the reader compares (b) to the definitions offered by the various historical figures in the 'Brief History of Psychology' in the gamebook, you will no doubt recognize the theoretical pluralism embodied in that statement.  My main for quoting this document is, however, (a).

The question if psychology is a science is a question of demarcation – the classic issue in the Philosophy of Science. But answering why psychology is a science assumes a affirmative answer to the demarcation problem, and hence, a particular view in the Philosophy of Science.  

For example, Wundt charged Hebart with non-scientific investigations into introspection, because Hebart did not adequately control the environment. Watson charged that McDougall's notion of behaviors having a 'purpose' was non-scientific, because McDougall did not follow strict verificationism in the philosophy of science. When Hull charged that Tolman's explanations were unscientific because they positing internal entities, he did so by citing Newton (1935). Miller and Chomsky rejected Skinner's arguments by citing Philosophers of Science such as Patrick Suppes, who contend that the history of science shows that scientists do posit internal entities, if they can modeled mathematically.

            <Text>## Noam Chomsky, PhD
### Your Biography

You are Noam Chomsky, PhD Revolutionary in Linguistics, Professor of Linguistics and Philosophy, MIT.

After primary education at an experimental school of progressive education in Philadelphia, you enrolled at the University of Pennsylvania where you studied mathematics, philosophy and linguistics. In 1951, you moved to Harvard, where you stayed until 1955. Your masters thesis The Logical Structure of Linguistic Theory was published in 1955, the same year you were granted your PhD In Linguistics from University of Pennsylvania.

In the debate between cognitivists and behaviorists, you are the 800 pound gorilla. In your short career, you have revolutionized the entire discipline of linguistics, founded (with George Miller and Herbert Simon and Newell) the new interdisciplinary field of Cognitive Science, and become the intellectual spokesperson of the American left.

1)	Revolution in Linguistics

Before Chomsky, linguistics was primarily descriptive and taxonomical. You see linguistics as a branch of cognitive psychology, whose goal is to discover the mechanism that produces all and only grammatical sentences in a language.  Your theory is complex, and you have changed it slightly over time, so this description should be read as highly introductory and superficial. As a student, you are strongly encouraged to read the primary sources below to get a sense of the complex issues herein.

Roughly then, you understand linguistics—the scientific study of language—as the study of the rules of grammar. In short:

&gt; “The person who has acquired knowledge of a language has internalized a system or rules that relate sound and meaning in a particular way. The linguist constructing a grammar of a language is proposing a hypothesis concerning this internalized system. The linguist's hypothesis, if presented with sufficient explicitness and precision, will have certain empirical consequences with regard to the form of utterances and their interpretations by the native speaker.”  (1968, p. 23)

Harkening back to the Port-Royalists of the 17th and 18th century, you hold that a system of propositions that expresses the meaning of a sentence is produced “by the mind as the sentence is realized as a physical signal, the two being related by certain formal operations that, in current terminology, we may call grammatical transformations.” In short, the meaning of a sentence is symbolically related to the physical structure of symbols in the brain.  The task of cognitive scientist is to understand these internal relations through the positing of informational systems.


You go on to distinguish between *surface structures* and *deep structures*. *Surface structures* are are structures of the language spoken, such as 'subject and predicate'.  *Deep structures* are structures of the underlying meaning. The sentences 'Bob is to the right of John' and 'John is to the left of Bob' have different surface structures but the same deep structure. On the other hand, some syntactic (grammatical) structures are insufficient to determine meaning. For example include 'I like her cooking', could mean 'I like what she cooks, in general' and 'I like her when she cooks,' or even 'I like it when someone is actively cooking her.' Three deep structures, one surface structure.

To provide an adequate theory of a language, one must specify the complete 'grammar' of that language. Doing so would require three parts: (1) a syntactical component that would generates sentences in that language, revealing the internal structure of the infinite set of possible sentences in the langauge (2) a phonological component that describes how the language sounds, and how it relates to the syntactical component, and (3) a semantical component that describes how a language means. These are represented in Illustration 1.  It is the task of the linguist to specify the rules by which the transitions take place.

2)	Contributions to Cognitive Science

In 1959, you published the famous “Review of Skinner's Verbal Behavior.” You were born in 1928 and received Ph.D in 1955, when you became an assistant professor of linguistics at MIT.  This review was written, then, when you were an untenured 31 year old. It is included as an appendix to the gamebook. This review is not only hugely inflential, it is hugely controversial.  Many people have accused you of not understanding behaviorism, misquoting Skinner, and various other academic abuses.

Your basic argument is two-fold, first that Skinner's terminology is hopelessly confused, and second, that behaviorism is unable to explain observable facts about language acquisition.  It is the second of these—which is an empirical claim, after all—that has been the most persuasive. It is important, however, that you master both.

There is another important point in your work, but it doesn't appear in the review. Consider Skinner's contention that science cannot take into account 'inner states.' You argue:

&gt; It is hardly possible to argue that science has advanced only by repudiating hypotheses concerning "internal states." By rejecting the study of postulated inner states Skinner reveals his hostility not only to "the nature of scientific inquiry" but even to common engineering practice. For example, Skinner believes that "information theory" ran into a "problem when an inner 'processor' had to be invented to convert input into output" (p. 18).
&gt; This is a strange way of describing the matter. Suppose that an engineer is presented with a device whose functioning he does not understand, and suppose that through experiment he can obtain information about input-output relations of this device. He would not hesitate, if rational, to construct a theory of the internal states of the device and to test it against further evidence. He might also go on to try to determine the mechanisms that function in the ways described by his theory of internal states, and the physical principles at work -- leaving open the possibility that new and unknown physical principles might be involved, a particularly important matter in the study of behavior of organisms. His theory of internal states might well be the only useful guide to further research. By objecting, a priori, to this research strategy, Skinner merely condemns his strange variety of "behavioral science" to continued ineptitude. (Chomsky, 1971).

3)	Politics

You have always been a dissident. You strongly object to the Vietnam war, and have always been a vocal opponent of American Foreign Policy that you see as ‘imperialisitic.’  You have been called a ‘socialist anarchist’ in a number of circles, and the name is not entirely wrong. You believe that any state that imposes its will on people needs to justify that imposition, and the justifications you have seen are lacking.

You have an affiliation with the Students for a Democratic Society – the SDS. The SDS is a national network of radical students opposed to the Vietnam war, capitalism and the like. While some have described you as the ‘faculty advisor’ for MIT’s branch of the SDS, the truth is that the SDS would not admit of such hierarchical arrangements. But perhaps it is better to just use the term, rather than have to explain to everyone that there were no such ‘faculty advisors’.

The SDS are radical, but generally peaceful. They did, however, come to the aid of the Stonewall patrons during the riots in Greenwich Village in 1969 (see ‘History of Gay Rights Movement’ in the game book). You fully support those actions.

In the summer of 1969, the SDS split amidst a conflict between the language of the ‘old-left’ Marxist-Leninist Weathermen underground and the ‘new left’ SDS-Workers Alliance.  The Weathermen underground radicalized after the split, and following the murder of Black Panther leader Fred Hampton, engaged in bombings and other acts of terrorism. You were in no way affiliated with the Weathermen.  In fact, their adoption of language from the brutal regimes of Lenin, Stalin and Mao is antithetical to your entire political agenda. We mention it here simply because your political opponents often seek to tar you with ‘guilt by association’ attacks, holding you responsible for the actions of the Weathermen.

You are, however, willing to work with many other advocates for human and civil rights, including Judd Marmor, Kenneth Clark and others.

Game Objectives

Remember that in addition to being one of the intellectual heavyweights of your era, you are a political radical, affiliated with the SDS: Students for a Democratic Society. The SDS came to the aid of the Stonewall rioters in 1969.  You are an ardent supporter of the movement to declassify homosexuality, as well as being generally concerned about the use of psychiatric and psychological concepts to control people.

Oppose and criticize Behaviorism when and wherever you can.  While you must carefully read your review of 'Verbal Behavior' that is contained in the appendix of the gamebook, you should also look at your 1971 paper 'The Case Against B.F. Skinner' available online (see below).  You are nothing if not polemic.

Organize and participate on a symposium and J. Marmor and K. Clark on the duties of academics with respect to social activism in 1974.  You should articulate the views contained in your 1967 paper, as well as your criticisms of behaviorism contained in your 1971.

Oppose the passing of the 'Leona Tyler principle', which states:

&gt; As citizens, members of the APA have the right to advocate for any cause through the myriad of political advocacy organizations, but when psychologists and psychiatrists speak for the profession through APA public stances and proclamations, it should be from science and professional experience.

&gt; On occasion psychiatrists are asked for an opinion about an individual who is in the light of public attention or who has disclosed information about himself/herself through public media. In such circumstances, a psychiatrist may share with the public his or her expertise about psychiatric issues in general. However, it is unethical for a psychiatrist to offer a professional opinion unless he or she has conducted an examination and has been granted proper authorization for such a statement.

Your final task in this game is to engage the Piaget in a public discussion or debate of the concept of 'innateness' in psychology, and the acceptability of positing innate ideas in a scientific enterprise. You should propose the event to the conference committee in time for it to happen in 1975.

As you will remember, the problem of innate ideas strikes the very core of the idea of the scientific study of the mind: the empirical hypothesis unifies the tradition as a whole, with the exception of Jungians. Moreover, the debate on homosexuality often turns, in the public mind at the least, on whether sexuality is innate (an 'orientation') or not (a 'preference').  The kind of innateness you and Piaget are discussing is probably not the same, as you both agree that the structure of thought that is innate, not the content. This should be made clear in your public discussion.

You posits that the there is a innate system of grammars that are common to all humans, as a function of our biology. Piaget agrees there is a 'fixed nucleus' of cognition that is innate, but only commits to the thesis that “the functioning of intelligence alone is hereditary.”  The actual debate is recorded in Piatelli-Palmarini's 1980 book, which you should review during the course of the game.

You are neutral on **the issue of the definition of mental illness**, but be ready to oppose any definition that is clearly behaviorist or psychoanalytic in nature.

#### Cognitivists

Cognitivists reject the behaviorists' conjecture that scientific psychology is limited—as *scientific* psychology—to observable behavior. But neither do they seek to reestablish introspection as a valid observational method.  Cognitivists agree that scientific evidence must be observable. But they disagree that the explanations of behavior must necessarily be in terms of observable macro-objects like organisms and environments.  Cognitivists see the mind/brain as an information-processing system; therefore an adequate scientific explanations would take form of the specifying the mechanisms by which information is processed—including positing algorithms or modeling neural mechanisms that would generate the behavior in question. The difference between the Cognitivists and the Behaviorists is not about the experimental methods they follow, but rather about the structure of a scientific explanation.

Thus, cognitivism distinguishes itself from behaviorism in terms of a meta-theoretical thesis which rejects the half of the first behavioristic hypothesis that *internal entities are explanatorily irrelevant to psychology.* It does not reject the other three, or the corollary of the first, *that introspection is not a form of observation.*

Cognitivism grew slowly between 1955 and 1965, in part because it was not an 'intentional' revolution like Behaviorism. George Miller's 1956 paper “The magical number seven, plus or minus two: Some limits on our capacity for processing information,” is one of the classics of cognitive psychology, although the term 'cognitive psychology' does not appear in it. Miller argues that  human's short-term memory behavior is limited to seven items plus or minus two.  These 'items', however, need not be individual atomic units like Ebbinghaus' nonsense syllables.  Miller hypothesized that brain could 'chunking' information into groups, which then could be easily remembered. To borrow a classic example from Bechtel and Graham, the sequence A, B, C, B, B, C, N, B, C, C, B, S would be difficult to remember on its own, but if it is 'chunked' into ABC, BBC, NBC, CBS, remembering it is simple. According to Miller, “There seems to be some limitation built into us either by learning or by design of our nervous system, al limit that keeps our channel capacities in this general range.” (1956, p. 86)  (see &lt;!--\ref{thesecondrevolution:cognitivescience}--&gt; for a historical introduction.) Miller's paper in included in the appendix.

            <Text>## Robert Spitzer, MD

### Your Biography

You are Robert Spitzer, psychiatrist. You were recently profiled by Alix Spiegel, grandson of John P. Spiegel, for the New Yorker (issue 2005-01-03). It is available online at http://metzelf.info/articles/Spitzer.html

 Allow me to quote excerpts of that article here:

&gt; “In the mid-nineteen-forties, Robert Spitzer, a mathematically minded boy of fifteen, began weekly sessions of Reichian psychotherapy. Wilhelm Reich was an Austrian psychoanalyst and a student of Sigmund Freud who, among other things, had marketed a device that he called the orgone accumulator — an iron appliance, the size of a telephone booth, that he claimed could both enhance sexual powers and cure cancer. Spitzer had asked his parents for permission to try Reichian analysis, but his parents had refused—they thought it was a sham—and so he decided to go to the sessions in secret. He paid five dollars a week to a therapist on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, a young man willing to talk frankly about the single most compelling issue Spitzer had yet encountered: women. Spitzer found this methodical approach to the enigma of attraction soothing and invigorating. The real draw of the therapy, however, was that greatly reduced Sptizer's anxieties about his troubled family life: his mother was a “professional patient” who cried continuously, and his father was cold and remote. Spizer, unfortunately, had inherited his mother's unruly inner life and his father's repressed affect; though he often found himself overpowered by emotion, he was somehow unable to express his feelings. The sessions helped him, as he says, “become alive,” and he always looked back on them with fondness. It was this experience that confirmed what would become your guiding principle: the best way to master the wilderness of emotion was through systematic study and analysis.

&gt; Robert Spitzer isn't widely known outside the field of mental health, but he is,e without question, one of the most influential psychiatrists of the twentieth century. It was Spitzer who took the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders — the official listing of all mental diseases recognized by the American Psychiatric Association (APA) — and established it as a scientific instrument of enormous power. Because insurance companies now require a DSM diagnosis for reimbursement, the manual is mandatory for any mental-health professional seeking compensation. It’s also used by the court system to help determine insanity, by social-services agencies, schools, prisons, and government, and, occasionally, as a plot device on “The Sopranos”. This magnitude of cultural authority, however, is a relatively recent phenomenon. Although the DSM was first published in 1952 and a second edition (DSM-II) came out in 1968, early versions of the document were largely ignored....
…Spitzer first came to the university as a resident and student at the Columbia Center for Psychoanalytic Training and Research, after graduating from N.Y.U School of Medicine in 1957. He had a brilliant medical-school career, publishing in professional journals a series of well-received papers about childhood schizophrenia and reading disabilities. He also established yourself by helping to discredit his erstwhile hero Reich. In addition to his weekly sessions on the Lower East Side,  the teen-age Spitzer had persuaded another Reichian doctor to give him free access to an orgone accumulator, and he spent many hours sitting hopefully on the booth’s tiny stool, absorbing healing orgone energy, to no obvious avail. In time, he became disillusioned, and in college he wrote a paper critical of the therapy, which was consulted by the Food and Drug Administration when they later prosecuted Reich for fraud.

&gt; At Columbia psychoanalytic, however, Spitzer's career faltered. Psychoanalysis was too abstract, too theoretical, and somehow his patients rarely seemed to improve.  “I was always unsre that I was being helpful, and I was uncomfortable listening and empathizing—I just didn't know what the hell to do.” Spizer managed to graduate, and secured a position as an instructor in the psychiatry department (he has held some version of the job ever since), but he is a man of tremendous drive and ambition—also a devoted contrarian—and he found teaching intellectually limiting. For satisfaction, he turned to research. He worked on depression and on diagnostic interview techniques, but neither line of inquiry produced the radical innovation or epic discovery that he would need to make his name.

&gt; As you struggled to find your professional footing in the nineteen-sixties, the still young field of psychiatry was also in crisis. The central issue involved the problem of diagnosis: psychiatrists couldn’t seem to agree on who was sick and what ailed them. A patient identified as a textbook hysteric by one psychiatrist might easily be classified as a hypochondriac depressive by another. Blame for this discrepancy was assigned to the DSM. Critics claimed that the manual lacked what in the world of science is known as “reliability” — the ability to produce a consistent, replicable result — and therefore also lacked scientific validity. In order for any diagnostic instrument to be considered useful, it must have both.

&gt; Spitzer had no particular interest in psychiatric diagnosis, but in 1966 you happened to share a lunch table in the Columbia cafeteria with the chairman of the DSM-II task force.”

According to Speigel, you struck up a conversation, got along well, and by the end of the meal you had been offered the job of note-taker on the nomenclature committee.  You were soon promoted to the chairmanship, which you hold when the game begins.

### Game Objectives

Your main concern is the perceived lack of legitimacy of psychiatry and psychology in the scientific community at the end of the 1960's.  Thomas Szasz's critiques of mental illness struck a chord in you.  You worry that the current classification system—especially the concept of 'neurosis'—is unreliable in the technical sense discussed in the 'Research methods' section of the gamebook. You worry that the public perceives psychiatry as convenient politically, particularly insofar as it's history is so closely tied to military needs. And most importantly, you believe that the classification of disease in terms of hypothetical causes that have no basis in biology makes psychiatry the laughing stock of contemporary medicine.

#### Declassification: 1971-1973

At the beginning of the game, you believe (at least you report that you believe) that homosexuality is a disorder.

Your role in this process is extraordinarily complicated, and the historical materials available contradictory and potentially disingenuous.  That means that you, as the student, will have to make some decisions about Spitzer's real motivations.  Here's the story as it is usually told:

 In 1972, you 'just happen' to attend a session on behavioral therapy for homosexuality. There, you are confronted by Ron Gold, a journalist and gay activist, on why you believe homosexuality is a disorder. He challenges you to cite reliable evidence, but you can't (you think Socarides and Bieber are Freudian ideologues).  You agree to set up a meeting with the nomenclature committee and a symposium in 1973 (in the game, Kameny &amp; Gittings will arrange it if they are characters). Gold then invites you and other members of the nomenclature committee to a secret meeting of the Gay-PA to happen at the Honolulu conference in 1973. You agree to go. While many of the psychiatrists at the meeting were distinctly uncomfortable with your presence, you witness an event that you report changed your life. The NPR program “This American Life” produced a wonderful episode titled '81 words' that covers the story.  I'll quote the crucial scene here. Alix Spiegel, the reporter, is the grandson of J. Spiegel.

&gt; Ronald Gold: I got invited to it but I was told you know keep it all very quiet and don't say anything and just come to this bar and we'll all be there. So I decided to invite Spitzer to come to this because he had told me essentially that he didn't know any gay psychiatrists and wasn't quite sure there were any. And I said, you just come along.

&gt; Alix Spiegel: Ron warned Spitzer not to say anything, he was instructed not to speak, or stare, or indicate in any way that he was anything other than a closeted gay man.

&gt; Ronald Gold: But once he got there and saw that the head of the Transaction Analysis Association and the guy who handed out all the training money in the United States, and the heads of various prestigious psychiatry departments at various universities were all there, he couldn't believe it. And he started asking all these dimwitted questions...

&gt; Alix Spiegel: Such as?

&gt; Ronald Gold: Oh I can't remember, but questions that no gay person would ask.

&gt; Alix Spiegel: At the time members of the GayPA were still completely hidden. They hadn't been active in the struggle to change the DSM; they were too fearful of losing their jobs to identify themselves publicly. So when Robert Spitzer, an obviously straight man in a position of power at the APA, appeared at the bar the men of the GayPA were completely unnerved.

&gt; Ronald Gold: So the grand dragon of the GayPA, whoever he was I can't remember now, came up to me and said, 'Get rid of him, get him out of here! You've got to get rid of him.' And I said I'm doing nothing of a kind, he's here to help us and you are not doing anything.

&gt; Alix Spiegel: And that's when it happened. There in front of Robert Spitzer and the grand dragon of the GayPA. There in the midst of neon coloured drinks and grass skirted waitresses a young man in full army uniform walked into the bar. He looked at Robert Spitzer, he looked at Ronald Gold, he looked at the grand dragon of the GayPA. And then the young man in uniform burst into tears. He threw himself into Ron's arms and remained there, sobbing.

&gt; Ronald Gold: Well I had no idea who he was. It turned out he was a psychiatrist, an army psychiatrist based in Hawaii who was so moved by my speech, he told me, that he decided he had to go to a gay bar for the first time in his life. And somehow or other he got directed to this particular bar and saw me and all the gay psychiatrists and it was too much for him, he just cracked up. And it was a very moving event, I mean this man was awash in tears. And I believe that that was what decided Spitzer, right then and there, let's go. Because it was right after that that he said, 'Let's go write the resolution.' And so we went back to Spitzer's hotel room and wrote the resolution.

This is an incredible story. And it may be true.  But there are some problems with the standard tale.

When questioned why you would meet the activists in 1972, you quipped “I could think of no reason not to.” But here is what is wrong with this standard narrative: you (as Spitzer) were already chair of the nomenclature committee when you attended Socarides' session on behavioral therapy.  Everyone know who you were, and what you had been tasked with.  Everyone knew that the APA was going to make a major decision in 1973 on homosexuality, and that that decision was the responsibility of the nomenclature committee. At the same time, you knew, given the protests in 1970 and 1971, that this panel was probably going to be shut down by protesters. With the distance of history, we now know that the protesters had maps of the conference hotel with their plans to disrupt this session laid out in detail. Some of these maps may well have made their way into the hands of the APA administration – i.e. you. So why where you there?

Spitzer reports not changing his mind about homosexuality until the events at the Tiki bar – but the proposal was put forward by Spitzer and passed at the same conference that the Tiki bar event took place. Despite what Gold and you say, it seems that there is not enough time to orchestrate such an important move with the careful, deliberate method you managed in the handful of days at a conference.

Third, this standard story leaves out the contributions of Judd Marmor and John Spiegel, both of whom worked hard to draft the proposal, and push it through the executive board in 1973.  

We leave it up to you (the student) to determine if Spitzer really did change his mind in 1973, or if he knew what he was doing all along. What you have to accomplish between 1971 and 1973 is:

Work with Judd Marmor and John Spiegel to draft a proposal to remove homosexuality from the list of mental disorders as they appear in the DSM-II. Balance the psychoanalysts, who may worry about their position of power in the psychiatric community, with the demands of the gay activists and the evidence produced by Hooker and Marmor that homosexuality is not per se damaging to the mental health of the individuals. The original wording of Spitzer's proposal (which you should not copy, but use as a model) is available – see the game master for the PDF.  It is APA Position Statement 197310.

You wish to retain, however, a diagnosis for those who believe that their homosexuality is damaging to their mental health, and who seek out help for homosexuality.  This new category, which you wish to call 'Sexual Orientation Disturbance,' is meant to provide a middle ground position between Marmor and Socarides, as it would allow treatment for individuals who found their homosexual orientation disturbing, thus producing subjective distress.  At the same time, it said nothing about those homosexuals who were comfortable with their orientation.

After the vote in 1973, petition the board for the dissolution of the nomenclature committee, which will be replaced by a task force to rewrite the DSM. This task force should be entirely under your control, from the appointing of members to the criteria of completion.

#### Task Force: 1973-1975

The first thing you must do is propose how the new DSM will be written.  You want the new DSM to be reliable across psychiatrists. Currently, the same behaviors could be classified as different diseases depending on the psychiatrists' theoretical commitments to the origin of those behaviors.  You want to change the taxonomy so that psychological disorders are classified according to “the criteria that have been shown by research study to have some validity in terms of variables such as course, response to specific therapy, familial pattern, etc,” (1979) thereby unifying diagnosis across theoretical traditions.

##### Proposed Study

Propose to the research committee a meta-study of existing research on the reliability of psychiatric diagnosis according to Cohen's Kappa. There are five existing studies available to survey:

* Schmidt, H. O. &amp; Fonda, C.P. (1956) “The reliability of psychiatric diagnosis: a new look” J abnor. Soc., Psychol., 52, 262-7 - 426 patients admitted to a state hospital in CT.

* Kreitman, N. (1961) “The Reliability of Psychiatric Diagnosis” J ment. Sci., 107, 876-86 – 90 consecutive new referrals to an out-patient clinic in England

* Beck, A.T., Ward, C.H. Mendleson, H., Mock, J.E. &amp; Ebaugh , J.K. (1962) “Reliability of psychiatric diagnosis: 2. A study of consistency of clinical judgments and ratings.” Amer. J. Psychiat. 119, 351-7   - 153 patients randomly selected from new referrals to out-patient services in Philadelphia

* Sandifer, M.G. Hordern, A. Timbury, G.C. &amp; Green, L. M. (1964) “Psychiatric diagnosis: A comparative study in North Carolina, London and Glasgow” Brit. J. Psychiat. 114, 1-9 – 91 patients at three hospitals in NC

* The US-UK Diagnostic Project [Cooper, J. E., Kendell, R. E., Gurland, B. J., Sharpe, L., Copeland, J.R.M., &amp; Simon, R. (1972) Psychiatric Diagnosis in New York and London, London: Oxford University Press – multiple studies

 The details of this meta-study are in Spitzer &amp; Fleiss (1974). Your instructor will specify whether you ought to preform these calculations yourself, and report your findings, or whether you can report the findings of the actual Spitzer and Fleiss, depending on the level of the class and your familiarity with statistics.
##### Defining 'Mental Illness'

During the process of drafting the definition of 'Sexual Orientation Disturbance', it became clear to you that the lack of a clear definition of 'mental illness' or its corollary 'mental health' was hindering the discussion.

You have two objectives during this period.  Your task force has to propose a new definition of mental illness that will be included in the DSM-III. Your group will not actually write the DSM-III for this game (in reality, it took until 1980), but you are to pass two major parts of that process: first, that the classification be based on symptoms and not putative causes; and second, that 'mental disorder' is a subset of 'medical disorder' and should be investigated and treated according to the medical model.  These two features make up what the core of what we now call 'descriptive psychiatry.' Prior to this period, a single patient could be diagnosed with different conditions, depending on the theoretical bent of the psychiatrist treating that patient. The unreliability of that classification scheme made many in the medical community—as well as psychiatrists like Thomas Szasz—question the legitimacy of the entire discipline. By unifying and regularizing the diagnostic criteria for psychiatric diagnosis, you can provide a firm basis for justifying psychiatry's role in medicine.

The first of these two tasks entails that you replace the current classification in terms of 'neurosis' and 'psychosis' with evidence-based classifications. Your approach is based on what was called the 'St Louis' approach after psychiatrists at Washington University in St Louis' Barnes Hospital developed it in the 1960s. The approach is summarized in Feighner et al. (1972), which you should present to the APA in 1972.

In Spitzer's own words:

&gt; Whereas in the standard system the clinician determines to which of the various diagnostic stereotypes his patient is closest, in the St. Louis system the clinician determines whether his patient satisfies explicit criteria.  For example, for a diagnosis of the depressive form of primary affective disorder the three requirements are dysphoric mood, a psychiatric illness lasting at least one month with no other pre-existing psychiatric condition, and at least five of the following eight symptoms: poor appetite or weight loss; sleep difficulty; loss of energy; agitation or retardation; loss of interest in usual activities or decrease in sexual drive; feelings of self-reproach or guilt; complaints or actual diminished ability to think or concentrate; and thoughts of death or suicide.” (1974, p. 345-6)


The second of these entails that the classifications focus on the treatments of conditions, rather than the causes of the conditions—thus, if two conditions are treated the same, they likely are the same. According to the St. Louis approach, it doesn't matter if the depressive form of primary affective disorder originates in childhood or recent trauma, the diagnosis—and hence the treatment—would be the same.

Allow me to take a moment to point out your conflict with other psychiatrists: Freud repeatedly asserted that the psychoanalysts was not interested in the outward manifestation of psychosis or neurosis, (e.g. p. 318 of Introductory Lectures), but rather in their origin. For Freudian psychiatry, a symptom was only a clue to how the individual mind in question had hidden away the true cause. It was the goal of psychiatry not to describe and classify symptoms, but to understand from where they originated.

In course of this reclassification, it becomes clear to you that constructing a taxonomy of mental disorders without a clear criteria for which conditions should appear in the nomenclature is not a viable strategy (see Sptizer, 1978, p. 15-16).  As a part of the redrafting of the DSM-III, you need to convince the APA to create a criteria for identifying mental disorders.  

Your strategy is to define 'mental disorder' as a subset of 'medical disorder'.  The concept of a 'medical disorder' entails (a) negative consequences of the condition, (b) an inferred or identified orgasmic disfunction and (c) an implicit call to action (ibid, p. 17). You intentionally use the term 'disorder' instead of 'disease' or 'illness,' as the former does not imply a progressive pathophysiological condition. Classifying medical disorders is an exercise in identifying conditions of orgasmic disfunction that, because of the negative consequences of that condition contain an implicit call to action. Implicit in the call to action is “the assumption that something has gone wrong with the human organism.” (italics his, ibid p. 18).

You propose the following definition of mental disorder:

&gt; A Medical disorder is a relatively distinct condition resulting from an organismic dysfunction which in its fully developed or extreme form is directly and intrinsically associated with distress, disability, or certain other types of disadvantage.  The disadvantage may be of a physical, perceptual, sexual, or interpersonal nature. Implicitly there is a call for action on the part of the person who has the condition, the medical or its allied professions, and society.
A mental disorder is a medical disorder whose manifestations are primarily signs or symptoms of a psychological (behavioral) nature, or if physical, can be understood only using psychological concepts. (1978, p. 18)

You should arrange an open session in 1974 to present your proposed definition of mental disorder prior to presenting it to the executive committee for vote in 1975.

Both of your tasks in this time period will put you at odds with psychoanalysts – including those who have been your allies on the removal of homosexuality. While you are welcome to create your own arguments for both of these claims, the strongest argument you probably have is that the DSM-III should be theoretically neutral.  

While you championed the removal of 'homosexuality' from the list of mental disorders, you are more concerned with the major changes you are attempting in the DSM-III.  Since homosexuality is such a flash-point in these debates, you believe it advisable to include a condition for homosexuals who are dissatisfied with their orientation.  You would like to propose 'homodysphilia.' Members of the taskforce, which you selected, may object to this classification. They will be hard to disagree with-- they are, after all, experts in human sexuality who you chose precisely because they had expertise you lacked. But you truly believe that you will not get your changes to pass without a compromise here.

You are amenable to other names: 'ego-dystonic homosexuality' may be more to their liking – and it's a political compromise anyway, so the name doesn't really matter that much.

Fission: Stick with the APA.

##### Summary

Your main task is to purge the DSM of taxonomies based in theory in favor of 'evidence-based' taxonomies.  In your words, you want to remove all diagnoses based on theoretical inter-psychic conflicts, and replace them with diagnoses based on behavior. For example, 'neurotic depression' is distinguished from 'depression' simply in terms of the notion of the Freudian concept of 'neurosis'.  At the same time, the psychopharmacological treatment for 'anxiety' and 'depression' are identical. What use is there in taxonomically distinguishing between two conditions for which the treatment is identical—especially if the causes of these conditions are entirely theoretical.

####Specific Assignments:

Present a paper on the Feighner Criteria to the APA in 1972, distinguishing it from the approach of the DSM-II.

Also in 1973, through the Nomenclature committee, propose a new DSM that will be based on descriptions of symptoms, not etiology of the condition.

In 1973, work with Ron Gold to draft a proposal to remove homosexuality immediately.  The argument here is the one alluded to above: the listing of 'homosexuality' in the official nomenclature does more harm than good, and that is unconscionable for a medical doctor.

Also in '73, propose that the nomenclature committee be disbanded, and the task of producing a new DSM be given to a taskforce under your direction.

Propose a research study on the reliability of psychiatric diagnosis in '73

Hold an open hearing in '74 on the definition of mental illness.

￼FOREWORD
The development of a uniform nomenclature of disease in the United States is comparatively recent. In the late twenties, each large teaching center employed a system of its own origination, no one of which met more than the immediate needs of the local institution. Despite their local origins, for lack of suitable alternatives, these systems were spread in use throughout the nation, ordinarily by individuals who had been trained in a particular center, hence had become accustomed to that special system of nomenclature. Modifications in the transplanted nomenclatures immediately became neces- sary, and were made as expediency dictated. There resulted a polyglot of diagnostic labels and systems, effectively blocking communication and the collection of medical statistics.
In late 1927, the New York Academy of Medicine spearheaded a move- ment out of this chaos towards a nationally accepted standard nomenclature of disease. In March, 1928, the first National Conference on Nomenclature of Disease met at the Academy; this conference was composed of representa- tives of interested governmental agencies and of the national societies repre- senting the medical specialties. A trial edition of the proposed new nomen- clature was published in 1932, and distributed to selected hospitals for a test run. Following the success of these tests, the first official edition of the Standard Classified Nomenclature of Disease was published in 1933, and was widely adopted in the next two years.1 Two subsequent revisions have been made, the last in 1942. The nomenclature in this manual consti- tutes the section on Diseases of the Psychobiologic Unit from the Fourth Edition of the Standard Nomenclature of Diseases and Operations, 1952.
Prior to the first edition of the Standard, psychiatry was in a somewhat more favorable situation regarding standardized nomenclature than was the large body of American medicine. The Committee on Statistics of the American Psychiatric Association (then the American Medico-psychological Association) had formulated a plan for uniform statistics in hospitals for mental disease which was officially adopted by the Association in May, 1917. This plan included a classification of mental disease which, although pri- marily a statistical classification, was usable in a limited way as a nomen- clature. The National Committee for Mental Hygiene introduced the new

classification and statistical system in hospitals throughout the country, and continued to publish the "Statistical Manual for the Use of Hospitals for Mental Diseases" through the years. The Committee on Nomenclature and Statistics of the American Psychiatric Association collaborated with the National Committee in this publication. With approval of the Council, and by agreement with the National Committee for Mental Hygiene (now the National Association for Mental Health), the Mental Hospital Service of the American Psychiatric Association now assumes responsibility for future publication of the Statistical Manual, which has been re-titled, "Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders," afid is presented here in its first edition.
The American Psychiatric Association cooperated, as the representative national society, in the establishment of the Standard Nomenclature of Disease. With the publication of the first edition of the Standard, a con- siderable revision in the Statistical Manual became necessary. This revision was accomplished in the Eighth Edition of the Statistical Manual, 1934. The classification system of the new Standard Nomenclature was included, together with a condensed list for statistical use. For the first time the difference in a system of nomenclature and a system of statistical classifica- tion was underscored (see Appendix A).
Only minor changes were made in the section on Mental Disorders in later revisions of the Standard, this section being essentially the same in the 1933 and 1942 editions. Many teaching centers devised modified systems of nomenclature for their own use, but the official nomenclature into which diagnoses were coded for statistical and medical record files remained the original 1933 nomenclature, as published in the Standard. As a result, at the beginning of World War II, American psychiatry, civilian and military, was utilizing a system of naming developed primarily for the needs and case loads of public mental hospitals. The origin of this system was in itself predictive of the difficulties which would soon be encountered.
The Armed Forces faced an increasing psychiatric case load as mobiliza- tion and the war went on. There was need to account accurately for all causes of morbidity, hence the need for a suitable diagnosis for every case seen by the psychiatrist, a situation not faced in civilian life. Only about W% of the total cases seen fell into any of the categories ordinarily seen in public mental hospitals. Military psychiatrists, induction station psychia- trists, and Veterans Administration psychiatrists, found themselves operating within the limits of a nomenclature specifically not designed for 9Q% of the cases handled. Relatively minor personality disturbances, which became
￼FOREWORD Tii
of importance only in the military setting, had to be classified as "Psycho- pathic Personality." Psychosomatic disorders turned up in the nomenclature under the various organ systems by whatever name a gastroenterologist or cardiologist had devised for them. The "psychoneurotic label" had to be applied to men reacting briefly with neurotic symptoms to considerable stress; individuals who, as subsequent studies have shown, were not ordi- narily psychoneurotic in the usual meaning of the term. No provision existed for diagnosing psychological reactions to the stress of combat, and terms had to be invented to meet this need. The official system of nomenclature rapidly became untenable.
In 1944, the Navy made a partial revision of its nomenclature to meet the deficiencies mentioned, but attempted to stay within the limits of the Stand- ard where possible. In 1945, the Army established a much more sweeping revision, abandoning the basic outline of the Standard and attempting to express present day concepts of mental disturbance. This nomenclature eventually was adopted by all Armed Forces, and in 1946 the Veterans Administration adopted a new nomenclature which resembled closely that of the Armed Forces. In 1948, a revised International StatisticalClassification was adopted, and categorized mental disorders in rubrics similar to those of the Armed Forces nomenclature.
By 1948, then, the situation in psychiatric nomenclature had deteriorated almost to the point of confusion which existed throughout medical nomen- clature in the twenties. At least three nomenclatures (Standard, Armed Forces, and Veterans Administration) were in general use, and none of them fell accurately into line with the International Statistical Classification. One agency found itself in the uncomfortable position of using one nomenclature for clinical use, a different one for disability rating, and the International for statistical work. In addition, practically every teaching center had made modifications of the Standard for its own use and assorted modifications of the Armed Forces nomenclature had been introduced into many clinics and hospitals by psychiatrists returning from military duty.
Following the adoption of new nomenclatures by the Army and Veterans Administration, the Committee on Nomenclature and Statistics of the Ameri- can Psychiatric Association postponed change in its recommended official nomenclature pending some evidence as to the usability of the new systems. In 1948, the Committee undertook to learn from the Army and Veterans Administration how successful the changes had been, and what the short- comings of the new systems were. Simultaneously, an effort was made to determine the sentiments of the membership regarding the need for a change in the then current Standard.
￼Tiii MENT AL DISORDERS
A high percentage of psychiatrists contacted felt that change in the nomen- clature was urgently needed, with special attention to the areas of personality disorders and transient reactions to special stress. The need for change seemed to be felt more strongly by those in clinic and private practice than by those in mental hospital or institutional work. However, a considerable proportion of mental hospital staffs urged change; this was especially true where outpatient clinics had been established in connection with the hospitals.
The Army and Veterans Administration reported that their revisions were considered successful by clinicians and statisticians. Statistically, the revisions were said to be more easily handled than the old nomenclatures, particularly when it became necessary to code diagnoses into the revised International. After some expected initial difficulties in using the new terms, clinicians reported that the revisions were much more useful than the old listing. Psychiatrists who had become accustomed to the revised nomenclature in the Army were unwilling to return to the Standard Nomenclature upon return to civilian life. The major shortcoming in both revisions was reported to be the classification of mental disorders accompanying organic brain disease, a minor problem in military psychiatry but a major item in civilian psychiatry.
With a need for a revision established, and guidelines drawn from the experience of the Armed Forces and Veterans Administration, the Com- mittee set about drafting a proposed revision. Source material received by the Army and Veterans Administration during the process of their revisions was utilized, psychiatric teaching units were contacted for ideas, especially concerning the organic brain disorders, and eflorts were made to obtain all possible suggestions from the body of American psychiatry, as well as from the literature. From March, 1950, the Chief of the Biometrics Branch, Na- tional Institute of Mental Health, served as a consultant to the Committee to assist with the statistical aspects of the revision.
In April, 1950, the Committee distributed mimeographed copies of a pro- posed revision of the psychiatric nomenclature to approximately 10% of the membership of the American Psychiatric Association. Addressees were picked from the geographical listing of members, 10% of the members in each State and Canada being selected. In addition, addressees were selected by position held, in order to give complete coverage to all areas of psychiatry. Attention was paid to membership in other organizations (American Neurological Association, American Psychoanalytic Association, Academy of Neurology, American Psychopathological Association, etc.), so that a fair
￼FOREWORD n
sampling of those groups was included. Members of the staffs of State Departments of Mental Health were included in order to obtain an expres- sion of opinion from such departments concerning the statistical and clinical impact of the proposed revision.
The proposed revision was accompanied by a nine-page questionnaire asking for opinions and suggestions on all sections of the revision. A dead- line of July 1, 1950, was set for return of the questionnaire in order that the work might be completed in time for the November, 1950 meeting of Council. As the questionnaires were returned, they were broken down into sections and mailed out to individual members of the Committee, each of whom had been assigned a specific area of the revision for study. A master file of questionnaire returns was established in the Office of the Medical Director for quick reference.
There were 520 questionnaires distributed; 241 were returned in time for consideration by the Committee. Of these, 224 (93%) expressed general approval of the suggested revision, 11 (5%) expressed general disapproval, and 6 (2%) were neutral. Such overwhelming approval was not accorded all sections of the revision, but the lowest approval rate on any section was 72%. The returns were not simply blanket approvals or disapprovals; more than half contained specific suggestions and recommendations. An unex- pectedly high proportion of addressees had made the revision and question- naire points of extensive discussion with colleagues. Several mental hospitals held a number of staff meetings devoted to such discussions, other clinics and administrative groups did the same. It therefore appeared that the Committee had received the considered opinion of a very large portion of American psychiatry.
Armed with this wealth of thoughtful material, the Committee prepared a second revision, incorporating the information obtained from the question- naires. As had been done in the case of the first revision, this second revision was sent to the Editor of the Standard Nomenclature for comment, and particularly to learn whether it could be incorporated in the general frame- work of the Standard. With minor changes in wording and coding, this second revision was acceptable to the Standard.
Accordingly, the revision was presented to Council of the American Psy- chiatric Association at its meetings on November 6, 1950, with the recom- mendations that it be adopted as the officially supported nomenclature of the American Psychiatric Association, that it be recommended by Council to the Standard Nomenclature for inclusion in the 1951 edition, and that the Committee be authorized to prepare this Diagnostic and Statistical
￼z MENT AL DISORDERS
Manual for publication by the Association. These recommendations were approved by Council.
The collection of statistics on mental illness morbidity has long been a stepchild of Federal Government. Delegated from year to year on a fiscal basis to the Bureau of the Census, morbidity statistics in this most important area perhaps would never have been collected had it not been for the untiring efforts of former Committees on Statistics of the American Psychiatric Association and the National Committee on Mental Hygiene. It has there- fore been most important in the past that this manual devote most of its attention to statistics, as was indicated by its name.
In 1946, an Act of Congress authorized the establishment of the National Institute of Mental Health, under the United States Public Health Service. A Biometrics Branch has been established in that Institute, and concerns itself with the operational features of statistical reporting. It is, therefore, no longer necessary for the American Psychiatric Association to remain in the operational field as far as statistics are concerned. In keeping with the status of this Association as a scientific professional society, it has seemed appropriate to limit the statistical section of this Manual to a statement of general principles and procedures, leaving the preparation of detailed operat- ing manuals to the operational agency created for that purpose, this Com- mittee acting in a consultant capacity to that agency.
Despite its recent origin, the Biometrics Branch of the National Institute of Mental Health has made handsome strides toward major statistical ob- jectives. A conference has been held of statisticians and mental hygiene administrators from 11 States, having together 55% of the average daily resident patient population in all State hospitals. The need for basic agree- ment concerning definition of terms and minimum tabulations has been emphasized. A model area for the reporting of morbidity statistics on the hospitalized mentally ill has been established. Further progress along these lines can be expected. Valuable operational data in the field of statistics has been, and is being, brought together, and is available to those who have detailed operational questions not covered by this Manual. This information may be obtained by correspondence with the Chief of the Biometrics Branch, National Institute of Mental Health, Bethesda 14, Maryland.
Dr. Morton Kramer, Chief, Biometrics Branch, National Institute of Men- tal Health, has worked with this Committee as Consultant in Statistics, and has prepared the majority of Sections IV and V. In addition, he and mem- bers of the Committee have worked assiduously with Dr. Selwyn Collins, Head Statistician, Division of Public Health Methods, United States Public

Health Service, and his assistant, Mrs. Louise E. Bollo, Nosologist, in pre- paring the crosscoding of Diseases of the Psychobiologic Unit of the Stand- ard, with the International Classification, an effort of no small note. Dr. Richard J. Plunkett, Editor of the Standard Nomenclature of Diseases and Operations, has been most cooperative and helpful. His Associate Editor, Mrs. Adaline C. Hayden, has been doubly assistive in her role of associate editor of the Standard and as co-author of the "Textbook and Guide to the Standard Nomenclature of Diseases and Operations," with Dr. Edward T. Thompson, who himself has spent much time working with such tedious problems as crosscoding the old and new nomenclatures.
The American Medical Association and P. Blakiston and Sons, Inc., publishers of the Standard Nomenclature, have permitted republication of several portions of the Standard necessary to make this Manual complete. The Physicians Record Company, publisher of "Textbook and Guide to the Standard Nomenclature of Diseases and Operations," has permitted repub- lication of parts of that book. These are indicated appropriately in the footnotes of the Manual.
As may be surmised from the narrative account above, it would be impossi- ble to acknowledge the assistance received from various members of the American Psychiatric Association and others, as they number many.
It would be unjust to list here only the names of those who were members of the Committee on Nomenclature and Statistics at the time of completion of this revision, since those who went before each contributed in some way to the information which finally led to this particular revision. For that reason, the names of those who have served on the Committee since 1946, with their terms of service, are listed.

￼SECTION I
0- DISEASES OF THE PSYGHOBIOLOGIG UNIT f INTRODUCTION
Previous changes of the Psychobiologic unit have been restricted by the timing of each revision. This revision is perfectly timed to include the experiences of psychiatrists of World War II, the results of several years usage by the military and Veterans Administration of a revised army nomen- clature, the pattern of a new international code and the results of several years deliberation of the Nomenclature Committee of the American Psychi- atric Association. As a result of all these we were enabled to offer a com- pletely new classification in conformity with newer scientific and clinical knowledge, simpler in structure, easier to use and virtually identical with other national and international nomenclatures.
Qualifying Phrases
. x l . x2 . x3
. x l
W ith psychotic reaction With neurotic reaction With behavioral reaction
The above qualifying phrases may be added to any diagnosis in the Psychobiologic Unit when needed to further define or describe the clinical picture. They will not be used where such use is redundant. In general, the phrase will be redundant when it repeats the major heading of any group of diagnosis, for example:
is redundant when used with a diagnosis listed under Psychotic
Disorders
.x2 is redundant when used with Psychoneurotic Disorders .x3 is redundant when used with Personality Disorders
A qualifying phrase is not ordinarily needed with any diagnosis in the group of acute organic brain disorders, as the diagnosis itself implies a delirium, a temporary psychotic state.

INTRODUCTION TO THE REVISED NOMENCL A TURE
This revision of psychiatric nomenclature attempts to provide a classifica- tion system consistent with the concepts of modern psychiatry and neurology. It recognizes the present day descriptive nature of all psychiatric diagnoses, and attempts to make possible the gathering of data for future clarification of ideas concerning etiology, pathology, prognosis, and treatment in mental disorders. It attempts to provide for inclusion of new ideas and advances yet to be made without radical revision of the system of nomenclature.
This nomenclature limits itself to the classification of the disturbances of mental functioning. It does not include neurologic diagnoses or diagnoses of intracranial pathology, per se. Such conditions should be diagnosed separately, whether or not a mental disturbance is associated with them. When an intracranial lesion is accompanied by a mental disorder, it is the mental disorder which is diagnosed in this present classification. Provision is made for contributory etiological factors to be stated as a part of the diagnosis, or as an additional diagnosis, as necessary (see Section III).
This diagnostic scheme employs the term "disorder" generically to desig- nate a group of related psychiatric syndromes. Insofar as is possible, each group is further divided into more specific psychiatric conditions termed "reactions." The code numbers are assigned in accordance with the over- all plan of the Standard Nomenclature of Diseases and Operations, a system fully explained in that publication.
All mental disorders are divided into two major groups:
(1) those in which there is disturbance of mental function resulting from, or precipitated by, a primary impairment of the function of the brain, generally due to diffuse impairment of brain tissue; and
(2) those which are the result of a more general difficulty in adaptation of the individual,and in which any associated brain function disturbance is secondary to the psychiatric disorder.
Perhaps the greatest change in this revision from previous listings lies in the handling of the disorders with known organic etiological factors. In these disorders [Group (1)] the psychiatric picture is characterized by im- pairment of intellectual functions, including memory, orientation, and
9

judgment, and by shallowness and lability o£ affect. This is a basic condi- tion, and may be mild, moderate, or severe. It may be, and more often than not is, the only mental disturbance present, or it may be associated with addi- tional disturbances which in this nomenclature are descriptivelyclassified as "psychotic," "neurotic," or "behavioral" reactions (see Qualifying Phrases). These associated reactions are not necessarily related in severity to the degree of the organic brain syndrome, and are as much determined by inherent personality patterns, the social setting, and the stresses of interpersonal relations as by the precipitating organic impairment. For this reason, these associated reactions are to be looked upon as being released by the organic brain syndrome and superimposed upon it. The organic brain syndrome thereupon becomes the proper focus of diagnosis; associated reactions should be specified, when necessary, by adding to the diagnosis a qualifying phrase describing the manifestation: .xl with psychotic reaction, jc2 with neurotic reaction, or .x3 with behavioral reaction. It is anticipated that the majority of organic disorders will require no qualifying phrase (see Qualifying Phrases).
When the organic brain syndrome is produced by prenatal or natal factors or in the formative years of infancy and childhood, the disturbance in intellectual development and learning ability may be prominent. Such disturbances, formerly diagnosed "Mental deficiency, secondary," are here listed under the chronic brain syndromes, where they seem more properly to belong. In these cases, when it is desired to stress the disorder of intelli- gence as the primary clinical problem, the diagnosis may be qualified with the phrase, .x4 with Mental deficiency, .x41 mild, .x42 moderate, or .x43 severe, and the current intelligence quotient will be included in the diagnosis. This categorization relegates the defect of intelligence to the sphere of symptomatology, rather than recognizing it as a primary mental disturbance.
An unsuccessful attempt was made to find a substitute for the long used term "mental deficiency." Mental deficiency is a legal term, comparable to the term "insanity," it has little meaning in clinical psychiatry. The term has been defined by law in England, and in some parts of the United States. The same objection is raised to the terms "idiot," "imbecile," and "moron." They have the further fault of being based upon psychological testing alone. In the borderline areas of each term, groupings vary with the immediate condition of the patient, as well as with the skill and training of the examiner. These last named terms have been eliminated.
It was necessary to retain a term for those cases presenting clinically primarily a disturbance of intellect, with no recognizable organic brain
￼INTRODUCTION TO THE REVISED NOMENCLATURE 11
impairment prenatally,at birth, or in childhood. Since no adequate substitute could be found, the title, "Mental Deficiency" was retained for this group. Degree is indicated by the terms "mild," "moderate," or "severe." No I.Q. limit has been set for these qualifying terms (see Section I I B ) , as it is believed that such arbitrary usage of a variable measure is not justifiable in clinical work. Authorities in this field have stated that persons classified under the older groupings of idiot and imbecile (in this classification both are included under "severe") always show postmortem evidence of chronic brain disorder. It would then appear that a primary diagnosis of Mental deficiency, severe, is inaccurate.
The Schizophrenic reactions have been increased in number and type to allow more detailed diagnosis. The Manic depressive reactions have been reduced in number, and, with a Psychotic depressive reaction, have been grouped into the "Affective reactions."
The "psychosomatic" disorders have been given a separate category to allow more accurateaccumulationof data concerningthem. The generic term, "Psychophysiologic Autonomic and Visceral Disorders," has been selected for this group because it seems to express best the interplay of psychic and somatic factors involved in thesedisturbances.
The Psychoneurotic Disorders have been classified on the basis of their psychopathology as it is generally understood today. The titles for Person- ality Disorders and Transient Situational Disorders have been elaborated and expanded.
Attention is called to the fact that the Section on Diseases of the Psycho- biologic Unit is only one section of the Standard Nomenclature of Diseases and Operations; adequate use of any one section requires knowledge and use of the entire Standard Nomenclature of Diseases and Operations.
More detailed instructions concerning the use of diagnostic terms applied to Disorders of the Psychobiologic Unit are to be found in the section which follows.
￼SECTION II B
DEFINITION OF TERMS
QUALIFYING PHRASES
The basic division in this nomenclature is into those mental disorders associated with organic brain disturbance, and those occurring without such primary disturbance of brain function, and not into psychoses, psycho- neuroses, and personality disorders. Other categorizations are secondary to the basic division.
This nomenclature permits the modification of any of the primary psychi- atric diagnoses by the qualifying phrases, .xl with psychotic reaction, .x2 with neurotic reaction, and .x3 with behavioral reaction. These are intended to describe any major alteration of the clinical picture of a diagnosed con- dition which may appear when further mental symptoms are superimposed on the basic disorder.
Grouped together under Psychotic Disorders are: (1) affective dis- orders, characterized by severe mood disturbance, with associated alterations in thought and behavior, in consonance with the affect; (2) schizophrenic reactions, characterized by fundamental disturbances in reality relationships and concept formations, with associated affective, behavioral, and intellectual disturbances, marked by a tendency to retreat from reality, by regressive trends, by bizarre behavior, by disturbances in stream of thought, and by formation of delusions and hallucinations; (3) paranoid reactions, character- ized by persistent delusions and other evidence of the projective mechanism.
From this grouping, a psychotic reaction may be defined as one in which the personality, in its struggle for adjustment to internal and external stresses, utilizes severe affective disturbance, profound autism and withdrawal from reality, and/or formation of delusions or hallucinations. The qualifying phrase, .xl with psychotic reaction, may be used to amplify the diagnosis when, in the presence of another psychiatric disturbance, a symptomatic clinical picture appears which might be diagnosed under Psychotic Disorders in this nomenclature. Specific examples may be seen in severe depression occurring in Chronic Brain Syndrome associated with senile brain disease, or paranoid delusions accompanying Chronic Brain Syndrome, alcohol intoxication.
Grouped as Psychoneurotic Disorders are those disturbances in which "anxiety" is a chief characteristic, directly felt and expressed, or automatically controlled by such defenses as depression, conversion, dissociation, displace- ment, phobia formation, or repetitive thoughts and acts.
12
￼DEFINITION OF TERMS 13
For this nomenclature, a psychoneurotic reaction may be defined as one in which the personality, in its struggle for adjustment to internal and ex- ternal stresses, utilizes the mechanisms listed above to handle the anxiety created. The qualifying phrase, .x2 with neurotic reaction, may be used to amplify the diagnosis when, in the presence of another psychiatric dis- turbance, a symptomatic clinical picture appears which might be diagnosed under Psychoneurotic Disorders in this nomenclature. A specific example may be seen in an episode of acute anxiety occurring in a homosexual.
Grouped as Personality Disorders are those cases in which the personality utilizes primarily a pattern of action or behavior in its adjustment struggle, rather than symptoms in the mental, somatic, or emotional spheres.
For this nomenclature a behavioral reaction (personality disorder) may be defined as one in which the personality, in its struggle for adjustment to internal and external stresses, utilizes primarily a pattern of action or behavior. The qualifying phrase, .x3 with behavioral reaction, may be used to amplify the diagnosis when, in the presence of another psychiatric dis- turbance, a symptomatic clinical picture appears which might be diagnosed Personality Disorder in this nomenclature. The changes in behavior, suffi- ciently gross to require diagnostic recognition, occurring in many of the chronic brain syndromes (Alzheimer's, cerebral arteriosclerosis, epidemic encephalitis, trauma) are specific examples.
In general, it should be noted that the qualifying phrases are provided when needed to further define or describe the clinical picture. They are applied only when superimposed symptoms are so marked that they defi- nitely color the clinical picture. Mild or transient superimposed symptoms will not justify the use of a qualifying phrase. It is anticipated that a diag- nosis of chronic brain syndrome will be sufficient in itself under ordinary conditions, and qualifying phrases will be needed only for further refinement of the diagnosis.
A qualifying phrase will not be used where such use is redundant. In general, the phrase will be redundant when it repeats the major heading of any group of diagnoses, for example: .xl is redundant when used with a diagnosis listed under Psychotic Disorders; jc2 is redundant when used with Psychoneurotic Disorders; .x3 is redundant when used with Personality Disorders (see Section III A, "Multiple psychiatric diagnoses" for incom- patible diagnoses).
A qualifying phrase is not ordinarily needed with a diagnosis of acute brain syndrome but a qualifying phrase may be used when superimposed manifestations warrant such use by their significant modification of the clinical picture.
￼MENTAL DISORDERS
DISORDERS CAUSED BY OR ASSOCIATED WITH IMPAIRMENT OF BRAIN TISSUE FUNCTION
These disorders are all characterized by a basic syndrome consisting of:
1. Impairment of orientation
2. Impairment of memory
3. Impairment of all intellectual functions (comprehension, calculation,
knowledge, learning, etc.)
4. Impairment of judgment
5. Lability and shallowness of affect
This syndrome of organic brain disorder is a basic mental condition char- acteristic of diffuse impairment of brain tissue function from any cause. It may be mild, moderate, or severe, but most of the basic symptoms of the syndrome are generally present to a similar degree in any one patient at any one time. The severity of this basic syndrome is generally parallel to the severity of the impairment of brain tissue function.
This syndrome may be the only mental disturbance present or it may be associated with psychotic manifestations, neurotic manifestations, or behav- ioral disturbance. These associated reactions are not necessarily related in severity to the degree of the organic brain disorder or to the degree of brain damage; they are determined by inherent personality patterns, current emotional conflicts, the immediate environmental situation, and the setting of interpersonal relations, as well as by the precipitating organic disorder. These associated reactions are to be looked upon as being released by the organic brain disorder and superimposed upon it. Since personality function depends greatly upon the integrity of brain function, various changes in personality reaction are to be expected with organic brain disorders. When these associated reactions are present to a significant degree, they are recog- nized by the addition of one of the qualifying statements listed (see Qualify- ing Phrases).
The organic brain disorders are separated into acute and chronic, because of the marked differences between these two groups in regard to prognosis, treatment, and general course of illness. The terms, "acute" and "chronic," refer primarily to the reversibility of brain pathology and its accompanying organic brain syndrome; and not to the etiology, onset, or duration of the illness. Since the same etiology may produce either temporary or permanent brain damage, a brain disorder which appears reversible, hence acute, at its beginning, may prove later to have left permanent damage and a persistent organic brain syndrome, which will then be diagnosed as chronic.

￼DEFINITION OF TERMS 15 ACUTE BRAIN DISORDERS
These are the organic brain syndromes from which the padent recovers. They are the result of temporary, reversible, diffuse impairment of brain tissue function such as is present in acute alcoholic intoxicadon or "acute delirium." The basic disturbance of the sensorium may release other dis- turbances such as hallucinations, poorly organized, transient delusions, and behavior disturbances of varying degree. While a qualifying phrase may not ordinarily be needed with any diagnosis in this group, a qualifying phrase may be used when superimposed manifestations warrant such use by their severe modifications of the clinical picture.
These disorders are subclassified according to the cause of the impairment of brain tissue function.
009-100 Acute Brain Syndrome associated with intracranial in- fection. Specify infection
Here are to be classified those conditions due primarily to intracranial infection, such as encephalitis, epidemic and other, meningitis of all causes, and brain abscess, which appear to be temporary and reversible.
000-100 Acute Brain Syndrome associated with systemic infection.
Specify infection
Here are to be classified those temporary, recoverable mental disturbances direcdy resulting from severe general systemic infections. Among the more common systemic infections producing such a reaction are pneumonia, typhoid fever, and acute rheumatic fever. Care must be taken to distinguish these reactions from other disorders, particularly manic depressive and schizophrenic reactions, which may be made manifest by even a mild attack of infectious disease.
000-3.. Acute Brain Syndrome, drug or poison intoxication.
Specify drug or poison
Drug: This category is intended for the inclusion of acute reversible brain syndromes due to drugs generally used in medical practices, such as bromides, barbiturates, opiates, or hormonal and similarly acting principles.
Poison: Here should be classified the acute brain syndromes associated with chemical action on the brain by substances not ordinarily used in
￼16 MENTAL DISORDERS
medical practice, such as lead, other metals, gas, and other sources of intoxi- cation (except alcohol) as listed in Category Three of the Standard Nomen- clature of Diseases and Operations.
000-3312 A cute Brain Syndrome, alcohol intoxication
This group is given separate status from other intoxications for statistical purposes. Here will be classified the acute recoverable brain syndromes attributable to alcohol, notably delirium tremens and acute alcoholic hallu- cinosis. When simple alcoholic intoxication produces an acute brain syn- drome requiring diagnosis, it will be classified here. Habitual alcoholism without brain syndrome should be diagnosed under Addiction. "Pathological Intoxication" may cause difficulty in proper diagnosis. When, without apparent preexisting mental disorder, there is a marked behavioral or psy- chotic reaction with an acute brain syndrome after minimal alcoholic intake, the case will be classified here. When a preexisting psychotic, psychoneurotic, or personality disorder is made more manifest after minimal alcoholic intake, the case will be classified under the diagnosis of the underlying condition.
000-4.. Acute Brain Syndrome associated with trauma. Specify trauma
Here are to be classified those cases of acute brain syndrome developing immediately after head injury produced by external trauma of a gross physi- cal nature, including surgery. Mental disturbances following injuries to other parts of the body are not to be classified here. Brain syndromes in which head trauma acts as a contributing or precipitating cause should be diagnosed under the proper etiological heading and not included in this group. This category does not include the chronic organic results of head injury.
000-5.. Acute Brain Syndrome associated with circulatory dis- turbance. (Indicate cardiovascular disease as addi- tional diagnosis)
Here arc to be classified those acute recoverable brain syndromes occurring as a result of such circulatory disturbances as cerebral embolism, arterial hypertension, cardio-renal disease and especially cardiac disease, particularly in decompensation. Acute fluctuations in the chronic progressive course of circulatory disturbances such asxcerebral arteriosclerosis will not be diagnosed here, but will be placed under the listing of Chronic Brain Syndrome.
￼DEFINITION OF TERMS 17
000-550 Acute Brain•Syndrome associated with convulsive dis- order. (Indicate manifestation by Supplementary
Term)
Under this heading will be classified only cases which show acute brain syndrome in connection with "idiopathic" epilepsy. Most common disturb- ance of this group is the epileptic clouded state occurring in those epileptics who develop, preceding or following convulsive attacks, or as equivalents of attacks, dazed reactions with deep confusion, bewilderment, and anxiety or excitement, with hallucinations, fears and violent outbreaks. Those cases in which the convulsive manifestations are symptomatic of other disease are to be classified under the headings for such other disease.
000-7.. Acute Brain Syndrome associated with metabolic dis- turbance. Specify
Here will be classified those acute reversible brain syndromes resulting from metabolic disturbance, such as uremia, diabetes, hyperthyroidism, vitamin deficiency, and so forth.
000-8.. Acute Brain Syndrome associated with intracranial neo- plasm. (Indicate neoplasm as additional diagnosis)
Here will be classified those acute reversible brain syndromes resulting from intracranial neoplasms, whether the neoplasm be primary or secondary. Reversibility of the pathological process underlying the acute brain syndrome (pressure, edema, etc.) is the basis of differentiation between acute and chronic syndromes of this category.
000-900 Acute Brain Syndrome with disease of unknown or un- certain cause. (Indicate disease as additional diagnosis)
Here will be classified those acute reversible brain syndromes resulting from diseases of unknown cause, such as multiple sclerosis. This diagnosis progressive disturbances of brain function.
This category differs from the one that follows, in that here the disease causing the acute brain syndrome is recognized and diagnosed although the etiology of the disease is unknown.
000-xxO Acute Brain Syndrome of unknown cause
This category is intended for those acute brain syndromes whose cause cannot be recognized. It may also be used for acute brain syndromes of
￼18 MENTAL DISORDERS
known cause, not elsewhere classifiable, in which case the causadve disease will be separately diagnosed. Record librarians and statisticians may use this category for incomplete diagnoses.
CHRONIC BRAIN DISORDERS
The chronic organic brain syndromes result from relatively permanent, more or less irreversible, diffuse impairment of cerebral tissue function. While the underlying pathological process may partially subside, or respond ta specific treatment, as in syphilis, there remains always a certain irreducible minimum of brain tissue destruction which cannot be reversed, even though the loss of function may be almost imperceptible clinically. The chronic brain syndrome may become milder, vary in degree, or progress, but some dis- turbance of memory, judgment, orientation, comprehension and affect persists permanently.
Other mental disturbances of psychotic, neurotic, or behavioral type may be superimposed on the chronic brain syndrome; when clinically significant, these will be recognized by addition of the appropriate qualifying phrase to the diagnosis (see Qualifying Phrases). When the chronic organic dis- order is present during infancy and childhood, and results in significantly disturbed intellectual development, this may be recognized by addition of the qualifying phrase, .x4 with Mental deficiency.
These disorders are classified according to the cause of the impairment of brain function. Some of the diagnostic categories are identical with those of the acute brain syndromes; the differentiation is based on the permanent impairment of brain function in the chronic group.
009-0.., 009-016,009-071,009-052,009-050 Chronic Brain Syndrome associated with congenital cranial anomaly, congenital spastic paraplegia, Mongolism, prenatal maternal in-
fectious disease, birth trauma
These categories are provided for the group of mental disturbances for- merly diagnosed as secondary mental deficiency. Clinically, a general devel- opmental defect of mentation is superimposed on the chronic brain syndrome, and when prominent may require the addition of the qualifying phrase .x4 Mental deficiency. The degree of defective intelligence will be specified as mild, moderate, or severe, and the current IQ rating will be added to the diagnosis (see Mental deficiency).
￼DEFINITION OF TERMS 19 009-147.0 Chronic Brain Syndrome associated with central nervous
system syphilis (Meningoencephalitic)
Here will be classified the cases formerly diagnosed as general paresis. In addition to the organic brain syndrome, these cases show physical signs and symptoms of parenchymatous syphilis of the nervous system, and usually positive serology, including the paretic gold curve. The psychotic reaction, when such occurs, may simulate one of the "functional" psychoses but is to be classified here, with the Qualifying Phrase, .xl with psychotic reaction.
004-147.0 Chronic Brain Syndrome associated with central nervous system syphilis (Meningovascular)
The mental disturbance is that of the chronic brain syndrome, and is indistinguishable from the mental disturbance of Meningoencephalitic syphilis. A differential diagnosis may be possible in those cases in which the history, signs, and symptoms, including serology, suggest a primary and predominating involvement of the meninges and blood vessels rather than of the parenchyma of the nervous system. Suggestive of this type of syphilis (cerebral) rather than general paresis, are: comparatively early onset after infection, sudden onset of mental disturbance, focal signs, particularly cranial nerve palsy, apoplectiform seizures, very high spinal fluid cell count, positive blood and spinal fluid serology, and prompt response to general systemic antisyphilitic treatment. Cases showing mental disturbances on a basis of cerebral lesions from syphilitic vascular disease will be classified here rather than under the heading Chronic Brain Syndrome associated with disturbance of circulation.
OyO-147.0 Chronic Brain Syndrome associated with other central nervous system syphilis
Here will be classified the comparatively infrequent cases of chronic brain syndrome associated with syphilis of the central nervous system not covered in the previous groups, including intracranial gumma.
009-1...0 Chronic Brain Syndrome associated with intracranial
infection other than syphilis. Specify infection
Here arc to be classified chronic brain syndromes associated with intra- cranial infection other than syphilis. Many of these disorders will have been diagnosed acute brain syndrome early in the course of the illness. The case
￼20 MENTAL DISORDERS
should be categorized here when it becomes apparent that there is diffuse, permanent damage to brain function. In addition to the primary diagnosis, many of these cases will require the use of a qualifying phrase; for example, encephalitides occurring in adolescence often develop a chronic brainsyn- drome with behavioral reaction.
009-300 Chronic Brain Syndrome associated with intoxication.
Specify
In these two groups will be classified those chronic, organic reactions which remain permanently following toxic insult to the brain by such agents as lead, arsenic, mercury, carbon monoxide, illuminating gas, miscellaneous drugs and alcohol.
Chronic Brain Syndrome, alcohol intoxication, includes all degrees of permanent brain damage resulting from the use of alcohol, ranging from very mild up to and including severe. The latter may manifest itself by the type of chronic delirium formerly diagnosed as KorsakofFs psychosis. Under such conditions the psychosis will be recognized by the proper qualifying phrase.
Many of these reactions are ushered in with an acute brain reaction to the intoxicant. The case will be placed in the chronic category when it becomes apparent that permanent, irreversible damage to the brain has occurred.
009-400 Chronic Brain Syndrome associated with brain trauma
Here will be classified the post-traumatic chronic brain disorders, which produce impairment of mental function. Permanent brain damage which produces only neurologic changes because of its focal nature, without signifi- cant changes in the areas of sensorium and affect, will not be classified here. Generally, trauma producing a chronic brain syndrome would have to be diffuse and would have to leave permanent brain damage. Post-traumatic personality disorder associated with chronic brain syndrome will be placed in this group with the appropriate qualifying phrase.
If the brain injury occurs in early life, it may manifest itself primarily in a developmental defect of intelligence. Such cases will be qualified by the phrase .x4 Mental deficiency, and the current I.Q. included in the diagnosis.
A head injury may usher in, or expedite the course of, a chronic brain disease, especially cerebral arteriosclerosis. The differential diagnosis in such cases may be extremely difficult. If the case history shows symptoms of circulatory disturbance, particularly arteriosclerosis, before the injury, and
￼DEFINITION OF TERMS 21
the physical examination confirms the presence of arteriosclerosis, the case will be classified under Chronic Brain Syndrome associated with cerebral arteriosclerosis.
009-516 Chronic Brain Syndrome associated with cerebral arterio- sclerosis
Here are to be classified those chronic, progressive, mental disturbances occurring in connection with cerebral arteriosclerosis. Clinical differentia- tion of the chronic brain syndrome associated with cerebral arteriosclerosis from that associated with senile sclerosis and presenile sclerosis may be impossible. Both underlying pathological changes may be present simul- taneously. The age, history, and careful survey of the symptoms may assist in determining the predominate pathology. Commonly, the organic brain syndrome will be the only mental disturbance present. When signifi- cant psychotic, neurotic, or behavioral reactions are superimposed, the diag- nosis will be qualified by the appropriate phrases (see Qualifying Phrases).
009-5.. Chronic Brain Syndrome associated with circulatory dis- turbance other than cerebral arteriosclerosis. Specify
Here are to be classified those chronic organic mental disturbances oc- curring in connection with circulatory disturbance other than cerebral arteriosclerosis, such as cerebral embolism, cerebral hemorrhages, arterial hypertension, and other chronic cardiovascular disease. Differentiation from the acute brain syndrome of like cause must be made on the irreversi- bility of the underlying brain damage. The circulatory disturbance will be specified.
009-550 Chronic Brain Syndrome associated with convulsive dis- order
Here will be included only those cases which show chronic brain syndrome in connection with "idiopathic" epilepsy. Most of the etiological agents underlying chronic brain syndromes can and do cause convulsions. Con- vulsions are particularly common in the presence of syphilis, intoxication, trauma, cerebral arteriosclerosis, and intracranial neoplasm. When the con- vulsions are symptomatic of such other etiological agents, the chronic brain syndrome will be classified under the headings for those disturbances rather than here.
￼22 MENTAL DISORDERS
The most common type of case to be categorized here is seen in those epileptics who show a gradual development of mental dullness, slowness of associative thinking, impairment of memory and other intellectual func- tions, as well as apathy. Qualifying phrases are to be used when indicated.
009-79x Chronic Brain Syndrome associated with senile brain disease
This category is designed for the classification of organic brain syndrome occurring with senile brain disease, whether this be mild, moderate or severe. These cases vary from mild organic brain syndrome with self- centering of interest, difficulty in assimilating new experiences, and "child- ish" emotionality, up to and including those so severely affected by senile brain disease as to require institutional care. Deterioration may be minimal or it may progress to a state of vegetative existence, with or without super- imposed psychotic, neurotic, or behavioral reactions (see Qualifying Phrases).
009-700 Chronic Brain Syndrome associated with other disturbance of metabolism, growth or nutrition (includes pre- senile, glandular, pellagra, familial amaurosis). Specify
This category includes the chronic brain syndromes associated with dis- orders formerly classified separately, such as Alzheimer's disease, endocrine disorders, pellagra, and others of a similar nature.
In Alzheimer's disease, the brain pathology is characteristic. Clinically, the disorder may be suspected in severe progressive brain syndromes occur- ring at a comparatively early age period, as in the forties. The degree of brain atrophy, which is generalized, is usually severe, and can be demon- strated by pneumoencephalogram.
Chronic brain syndromes associated with complications of diabetes (not due. to accompanying cerebral arteriosclerosis), disorders of the thyroid, pituitary, adrenals, and other disorders of metabolism, are to be classified under this heading. The majority of organic reactions occurring on a glandular or metabolic basis are acute and recoverable. They will be classified here only when there is evidence of permanent impairment of brain function.
Chronic brain syndromes associated with pellagra or other avitaminosis are included in this group. Cases developing pellagra or avitaminosis during the course of some other psychiatric disorder will not be classified under this heading, unless permanent brain damage occurs as a result of the avitaminosis.
￼DEFINITION OF TERMS 23 009-8.. Chronic Brain Syndrome associated with intracranial neo-
plasm. Specify neoplasm
This category includes the chronic brain syndromes resulting from intra- cranial neoplasms, whether the neoplasm be primary or secondary. This category does not include reactions to new growths elsewhere in the body than in the cranium. Differentiation from the acute brain syndrome of like cause is made by the presence of irreversible brain damage.
009-900 Chronic Brain Syndrome associated with diseases of un- known or uncertain cause (includes multiple sclerosis, Huntington's chorea, Pick's disease and other diseases of a familial or hereditary nature). Indicate disease by additional diagnosis
Here will be classified those chronic brain syndromes associated with irreversible disruption of brain function by such disorders of unknown eti- ology as multiple sclerosis, Pick's disease, and Huntington's chorea.
This category differs from the one that follows (009-xxO), in that here the disease causing the chronic brain syndrome is recognized and diagnosed, although the etiology of the disease is unknown.
009-xxO Chronic Brain Syndrome of unknown cause
This category is intended for those chronic brain syndromes whose cause cannot be recognized. It may also be used for chronic brain syndrome of known cause, not elsewhere classifiable, in which case the causative disease will be specified. Record librarians and statisticians may use this category
for incomplete diagnoses.
MENTAL DEFICIENCY
000-x90 and 000-y90 Mental deficiency
Here will be classified those cases presenting primarily a defect of intelli- gence existing since birth, without demonstrated organic brain disease or known prenatal cause. This group will include only those cases formerly known as familial or "idiopathic" mental deficiencies. The degree of intelli- gence defect will be specified as mild, moderate, or severe, and the current I.Q. rating, with the name of the test used, will be added to the diagnosis. In general, mild refers to functional (vocational) impairment, as would be ex-
￼24 MENTAL DISORDERS
pected with I.Q.'s of approximately 70 to 85; moderate is used for functional impairment requiring special training and guidance, such as would be expected with I.Q.'s of about 50-70; severe refers to the functional impairment requiring custodial or complete protective care, as would be expected with I.Q.'s below 50. The degree of defect is estimated from other factors than merely psychological test scores, namely, consideration of cultural, physical and emotional determinants, as well as school, vocational and social effective- ness. The diagnosis may be modified by the appropriate qualifying phrase, when, in addition to the intellectual defects, there are significant psychotic, neurotic, or behavioral reactions.
DISORDERS OF PSYGHOGENIG ORIGIN OR WITHOUT CLEARLY DEFINED PHYSICAL CAUSE OR STRUCTURAL CHANGE IN THE BRAIN
PSYCHOTIC DISORDERS
These disorders are characterized by a varying degree of personality dis- integration and failure to test and evaluate correctly external reality in various spheres. In addition, individuals with such disorders fail in their ability to relate themselves effectively to other people or to their own work.
000-796 Involutiohal psychotic reaction
In this category may be included psychotic reactions characterized most commonly by depression occurring in the involutional period, without previous history of manic depressive reaction, and usually in individuals of compulsive personality type. The reaction tends to have a prolonged course and may be manifested by worry, intractable insomnia, guilt, anxiety, agita- tion, delusional ideas, and somatic concerns. Some cases are characterized chiefly by depression and others chiefly by paranoid ideas. Often there are somatic preoccupations to a delusional degree.
Differentiation may be most difficult from other psychotic reactions with onset in the involutional period; reactions will not be included in this category merely because of their occurrence in this age group.
000-xlO AFFECTIVE REACTIONS
These psychotic reactions are characterized by a primary, severe, disorder of mood, with resultant disturbance of thought and behavior, in consonance with the affect.
￼DEFINITION OF TERMS 25
000-xll—000-xl3 Manic depressive reactions
These groups comprise the psychotic reactions which fundamentally are marked by severe mood swings, and a tendency to remission and recurrence. Various accessory symptoms such as illusions, delusions, and hallucinations may be added to the fundamental affective alteration.
Manic depressive reaction is synonymous with the term manic depressive psychosis. The reaction will be further classified into the appropriate one of the following types: manic, depressed, or other.
000-xll Manic depressive reaction, manic type
This group is characterized by elation or irritability, with overtalkativeness, flight of ideas, and increased motor activity. Transitory, often momentary, episodes of depression may occur, but will not change the classification from the manic type of reaction.
000-xl2 Manic depressive reaction, depressed type
Here will be classified those cases with outstanding depression of mood and with mental and motor retardation and inhibition; in some cases there is much uneasiness and apprehension. Perplexity, stupor or agitation may be prominent symptoms, and may be added to the diagnosis as manifestations.
000-xl3 Manic depressive reaction, other
Here will be classified only those cases with marked mixtures of the cardinal manifestations of the above two phases (mixed type), or those cases where continuous alternation of the two phases occur (circular type). Other specified varieties of manic depressive reaction (manic stupor or un- productive mania) will also be included here.
000-xl4 Psychotic depressive reaction
These patients are severely depressed and manifest evidence of gross mis- interpretation of reality, including, at times, delusions and hallucinations. This reaction differs from the manic depressive reaction, depressed type, principally in (1) absence of history of repeated depressions or of marked cyclothymic mood swings, (2) frequent presence of environmental precipitat- ing factors. This diagnostic category will be used when a "reactive depres- sion" is of such quality as to place it in the group of psychoses (see 000-x06 Depressive reaction).
￼26 MENTAL DISORDERS
000-x20 SCHIZOPHRENIC REACTIONS
This term is synonymous with the formerly used term dementia praecox. It represents a group of psychotic reactions characterized by fundamental disturbances in reality relationships and concept formations, with affective, behavioral, and intellectual disturbances in varying degrees and mixtures. The disorders are marked by strong tendency to retreat from reality, by emotional disharmony, unpredictable disturbances in stream of thought, regressive behavior, and in some, by a tendency to "deterioration." The pre- dominant symptomatology will be the determining factor in classifying such patients into types.
000-x21 Schizophrenic reaction, simple type
This type of reaction is characterized chiefly by reduction in external attach- ments and interests and by impoverishment of human relationships. It often involves adjustment on a lower psychobiological level of functioning, usually accompanied by apathy and indifference but rarely by conspicuous delusions or hallucinations. The simple type of schizophrenic reaction characteristically manifests an increase in the severity of symptoms over long periods, usually with apparent mental deterioration, in contrast to the schizoid personality, in which there is little if any change.
000-x22 Schizophrenic reaction, hebephrenic type
These reactions are characterized by shallow, inappropriate affect, unpre- dictable giggling, silly behavior and mannerisms, delusions, often of a so- matic nature, hallucinations, and regressive behavior.
000-x23 Schizophrenic reaction, catatonic type
These reactions are characterized by conspicuous motor behavior, exhibit- ing either marked generalized inhibition (stupor, mutism, negativism and waxy flexibility) or excessive motor activity and excitement. The individual may regress to a state of vegetation.
000-x24 Schizophrenic reaction, paranoid type
This type of reaction is characterized by autistic, unrealistic thinking, with mental content composed chiefly of delusions of persecution, and/or of grandeur, ideas of reference, and often hallucinations. It is often character-
￼DEFINITION OF TERMS 27
ized by unpredictable'behavior, with a fairly constant attitude of hostility and aggression. Excessive religiosity may be present with or without delu- sions of persecution. There may be an expansive delusional system of omnipotence, genius, or special ability. The systematized paranoid hypo- chondriacal states are included in this group.
000-x25 Schizophrenic reaction, acute undifferentiated type
This reaction includes cases exhibiting a wide variety of schizophrenic symptomatology, such as confusion of thinking and turmoil of emotion, manifested by perplexity, ideas of reference, fear and dream states, and dissociative phenomena. These symptoms appear acutely, often without apparent precipitating stress, but exhibiting historical evidence of prodromal symptoms. Very often the reaction is accompanied by a pronounced affective coloring of either excitement or depression. The symptoms often clear in a matter of weeks, although there is a tendency for them to recur. Cases usually are grouped here in the first, or an early, attack. If the reaction subsequently progresses, it ordinarilycrystallizesinto one of the other defina- ble reaction types.
000-x26 Schizophrenic reaction, chronic undifferentiated type
The chronic schizophrenic reactions exhibit a mixed symptomatology, and when the reaction cannot be classified in any of the more clearly defined types, it will be placed in this group. Patients presenting definite schizo- phrenic thought, affect and behavior beyond that of the schizoid personality, but not classifiable as any other type of schizophrenic reaction, will also be placed in this group. This includes the so-called "latent," "incipient," and "pre-psychotic" schizophrenic reactions.
OOQ-x27 Schizophrenic reaction, schizo-affective type
This category is intended for those cases showing significant admixtures of schizophrenic and affective reactions. The mental content may be predomi- nantly schizophrenic, with pronounced elation or depression. Cases may show predominantly affective changes with schizophrenic-like thinking or bizarre behavior. The prepsychotic personality may be at variance, or inconsistent, with expectations based on the presenting psychotic symptomatology. On prolonged observation, such cases usually prove to be basically schizophrenic in nature.
￼28 MENTAL DISORDERS
000-x28 Schizophrenic reaction, childhood type
Here will be classified those schizophrenic reactions occurring before puberty. The clinical picture may differ from schizophrenic reactions occur- ring in other age periods because of the immaturity and plasticity of the patient at the time of onset of the reaction. Psychotic reactions in children, manifesting primarily autism, will be classified here. Special symptomatology may be added to the diagnosis as manifestations.
000-x29 Schizophrenic reaction, residual type
This term is to be applied to those patients who, after a definite psychotic, schizophrenic reaction, have improved sufficiently to be able to get along in the community, but who continue to show recognizable residual disturbance of thinking, affectivity, and/or behavior.
000-x30 PARANOID REACTIONS
In this group are to be classified those cases showing persistent delusions, generally persecutory or grandiose, ordinarily without hallucinations. The emotional responses and behavior are consistent with the ideas held. Intelli- gence is well preserved. This category does not include those reactions properly classifiable under Schizophrenic reaction, paranoid type.
000-x31 Paranoia
This type of psychotic disorder is extremely rare. It is characterized by an intricate, complex, and slowly developing paranoid system, often logically elaborated after a false interpretation of an actual occurrence. Frequently, the patient considers himself endowed with superior or unique ability. The paranoid system is particularly isolated from much of the normal stream of consciousness, without hallucinations and with relative intactness and preser- vation of the remainder of the personality, in spite of a chronic and prolonged course.
000-x32 Paranoid state
This type of paranoid disorder is characterized by paranoid delusions. It lacks the logical nature of systematization seen in paranoia; yet it does not manifest the bizarre fragmentation and deterioration of the schizophrenic reactions. It is likely to be of a relatively short duration, though it may be persistent and chronic.
￼DEFINITION OF TERMS 29 000-xyO PSYCHOTIC REACTION WITHOUT CLEARLY DEFINED
STRUCTURAL CHANGE, OTHER THAN ABOVE
This classification is introduced primarily for the use of librarians and statisticians in those instances where the diagnosis has been left incomplete, and is not classifiable. This diagnosis is not intended for mixed reactions, which should be classified according to the predominant reaction.
PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGIC AUTONOMIC AND VISCERAL DISORDERS
This term is used in preference to "psychosomatic disorders," since the latter term refers to a point of view on the discipline of medicine as a whole rather than to certain specified conditions. It is preferred to the term "somatization reactions," which term implies that these disorders are simply another form of psychoneurotic reaction. These disorders are here given a separate grouping between psychotic and psychoneurotic reactions, to allow more accurate accumulation of data concerning their etiology, course, and relation to other mental disorders.
These reactions represent the visceral expression of affect which may be thereby largely prevented from being conscious. The symptoms are due to a chronic and exaggerated state of the normal physiological expression of emotion, with the feeling, or subjective part, repressed. Such long continued visceral states may eventually lead to structural changes.
This group includes the so-called "organ neuroses." It also includes some of the cases formerly classified under a wide variety of diagnostic terms, such as "anxiety state," "cardiac neurosis," "gastric neurosis," and so forth. Differentiation is made from conversion reactions by (1) involvement of organs and viscera innervated by the autonomic nervous system, hence not under full voluntary control or perception; (2) failure to alleviate anxiety;
(3) physiological rather than symbolic origin of symptoms; (4) frequent production of structural changes which may threaten life. Differentiation is made from anxiety reactions primarily by predominant, persistent involve- ment of a single organ system.
Each diagnosis of this type of reaction will be amplified with the specific symptomatic manifestations, e.g., anorexia, loss of weight, dysmenorrhea, hypertension, and so forth.
￼30 MENTAL DISORDERS
001-580 Psychophysiologic skin reaction
This category includes such skin reactions as neurodermatoses, pruritus, atopic dermatitis, hyperhydrosis, and so forth, in which emotional factors play a causative role.
002-580 Psychophysiologic musculoskeletal reaction
This category includes muscuoloskeletal disorders such as "psychogenic rheumatism," backache, muscle cramps, myalgias (to include some cases of cephalagia, tension headaches) in which emotional factors play a causative role. In this group, differentiation from conversion reactions is of prime importance and at times is extremely difficult.
003-580 Psychophysiologic respiratory reaction
This category includes cases of bronchial spasm, some hyperventilation syndromes, sighing respirations, hiccoughs, and so forth, in which emotional factors play a causative role.
004-580 Psychophysiologic cardiovascular reaction
This category includes such types of cardiovascular disorders as paroxysmal tachycardia, hypertension, vascular spasms, migraine, and so forth, in which emotional factors play a causative role.
005-580 Psychophysiologic hemic and lymphatic reaction
Here may be included any disturbances in the hemic and lymphatic system in which emotional factors are found to play a causative role.
006-580 Psychophysiologic gastrointestinal reaction
This category includes such specified types of gastrointestinal disorders as peptic-ulccr-like reaction, chronic gastritis, ulcerative or mucous colitis, constipation, hyperacidity, pylorospasm, "heartburn," "irritable colon," "ano- rexia nervosa," and so forth, in which emotional factors play a causative role.
007-580 Psychophysiologic genitourinary reaction
This category includes some types of menstrual disturbances, dysuria, and so forth, in which emotional factors play a causative role.
￼DEFINITION OF TERMS 31
008-580 Psychophysiologic endocrine reaction
This category includes endocrine disorders in which emotional factors play a causative role. Specify endocrine disturbance.
009-580 Psychophysiologic nervous system reaction
This category includes psychophysiologic asthenic reaction, in which gen- eral fatigue is the predominating complaint. There may be associated visceral complaints. The term includes many cases formerly called "neurasthenia." In some instances, an asthenic reaction may represent a conversion reaction; if so, it will be so classified, with asthenia as a manifestation. In other in- stances it may be a manifestation of anxiety reaction and should be recorded as such.
Also included in this category are convulsive disorders not otherwise classifiable in which emotional factors play a causative role. Differentiation must be made from the convulsions of conversion reaction.
OOx-580 Psychophysiologic reaction of organs of special sense
Here may be included any disturbances in the organs of special sense in which emotional factors are found to play a causative role and in which conversion reactions are excluded (see 000-x03).
PSYCHONEUROTIC DISORDERS
The chief characteristic of these disorders is "anxiety" which may be directly felt and expressed or which may be unconsciously and automatically controlled by the utilization of various psychological defense mechanisms (depression, conversion, displacement, etc.). In contrast to those with psy- choses, patients with psychoneurotic disorders do not exhibit gross distortion or falsification of external reality (delusions, hallucinations, illusions) and they do not present gross disorganization of the personality. Longitudinal
(lifelong) studies of individuals with such disorders usually present evidence of periodic or constant maladjustment of varying degree from early life. Special stress may bring about acute symptomatic expression of such disorders.
"Anxiety" in psychoneurotic disorders is a danger signal felt and perceived by the conscious portion of the personality. It is produced by a threat from within the personality (e.g., by supercharged repressed emotions, including
￼32 MENTAL DISORDERS
such aggressive impulses as hostility and resentment), with or without stimulation from such external situations as loss of love, loss of prestige, or threat of injury. The various ways in which the patient attempts to handle this anxiety results in the various types of reactions listed below.
In recording such reactions the terms "traumatic neurosis," or "traumatic reaction" will not be used; instead, the particular psychiatric reaction will be specified. Likewise, the term "mixed reaction" will not be used; instead, the predominant type of reaction will be recorded, qualified by reference to other types of reactions as part of the symptomatology.
000-xOl A nxiety reaction
In this kind of reaction the anxiety is diffuse and not restricted to definite situations or objects, as in the case of phobic reactions. It is not controlled by any specific psychological defense mechanism as in other psychoneurotic reactions. This reaction is characterized by anxious expectation and fre- quently associated with somatic symptomatology. The condition is to be differentiated from normal apprehensiveness or fear. The term is synony- mous with the former term "anxiety state."
000-x02 Dissociative reaction
This reaction represents a type of gross personality disorganization, the basis of which is a neurotic disturbance, although the diffuse dissociation seen in some casts may occasionally appear psychotic. The personality disorgani- zation may result in aimless running or "freezing." The repressed impulse giving rise to the anxiety may be discharged by, or deflected into, various symptomatic expressions, such as depersonalization, dissociated personality, stupor, fugue, amnesia, dream state, somnambulism, etc. The diagnosis will specify symptomatic manifestations.
These reactions must be differentiated from schizoid personality, from schizophrenic reaction, and from analogous symptoms in some other types of neurotic reactions. Formerly, this reaction has been classified as a type of "conversion hysteria."
000-x03 Conversion reaction
Instead of being experienced consciously (either diffusely or displaced, as in phobias) the impulse causing the anxiety is "converted" into functional symptoms in organs or parts of the body, usually those that are mainly under
￼DEFINITION OF TERMS 33
voluntary control. The symptoms serve to lessen conscious (felt) anxiety and ordinarily are symbolic of the underlying mental conflict. Such reactions usually meet immediate needs of the patient and are, therefore, associated with more or less obvious "secondary gain." They are to be differentiated from psychophysiologic autonomic and visceral disorders. The term "con- version reaction" is synonymous with "conversion hysteria." Dissociative reactions are not included in this diagnosis.
In recording such reactions the symptomatic manifestations will be speci- fied as anesthesia (anosmia, blindness, deafness), paralysis (paresis, aphonia, monoplegia, or hemiplegia), dyskinesis (tic, tremor, posturing, catalepsy).
000-x04 Phobic reaction
The anxiety of these patients becomes detached from a specific idea, object, or situation in the daily life and is displaced to some symbolic idea or situa- tion in the form of a specific neurotic fear. The commonly observed forms of phobic reaction include fear of syphilis, dirt, closed places, high places, open places, animals, etc. The patient attempts to control his anxiety by avoiding the phobic object or situation.
In recording this diagnosis the manifestations will be indicated. The term is synonymous with the former term "phobia" and includes some of the cases formerly classified as "anxiety hysteria."
000-x05 Obsessive compulsive reaction
In this reaction the anxiety is associated with the persistence of unwanted ideas and of repetitive impulses to perform acts which may be considered morbid by the patient. The patient himself may regard his ideas and behav- ior as unreasonable, but nevertheless is compelled to carry out his rituals.
The diagnosis will specify the symptomatic expression of such reactions, as touching, counting, ceremonials, hand-washing, or recurring thoughts (accompanied often by a compulsion to repetitive action). This category includes many cases formerly classified as "psychasthenia."
000-x06 Depressive reaction
The anxiety in this reaction is allayed, and hence partially relieved, by depression and self-depreciation. The reaction is precipitated by a current situation, frequently by some loss sustained by the patient, and is often associated with a feeling of guilt for past failures or deeds. The degree of
￼34 MENTAL DISORDERS
the reaction in such cases is dependent upon the intensity of the patient's ambivalent feeling toward his loss (love, possession) as well as upon the realistic circumstances of the loss.
The term is synonymous with "reactive depression" and is to be differenti- ated from the corresponding psychotic reaction. In this differentiation, points to be considered are (1) life history of patient, with special reference to mood swings (suggestive of psychotic reaction), to the personality structure
(neurotic or cyclothymic) and to precipitating environmental factors and (2) absence of malignant symptoms (hypochondriacal preoccupation, agita- tion, delusions, particularly somatic, hallucinations, severe guilt feelings, intractable insomnia, suicidal ruminations, severe psychomotor retardation, profound retardation of thought, stupor).
000-xOy Psychoneurotic reaction, other
Under this classification will come all reactions considered psychoneurotic and not elsewhere classified. (Psychoneurotic manic reactions, etc.) This category is designed also for the use of record librarians and statisticians dealing with incomplete diagnoses. It does not include "mixed" reactions, which are to be diagnosed according to the predominant reaction.
PERSONALITY DISORDERS
These disorders are characterized by developmental defects or pathological trends in the personality structure, with minimal subjective anxiety, and little or no sense of distress. In most instances, the disorder is manifested by a lifelong pattern of action or behavior, rather than by mental or emotional symptoms. Occasionally, organic diseases of the brain (epidemic encepha- litis, head injury, Alzheimer's disease, etc.) will produce clinical pictures resembling a personality disorder. In such instances, the condition is properly diagnosed as a Chronic Brain Syndrome (of appropriate origin) with behav- ioral reaction.
The personality disorders are divided into three main groups with one additional grouping for flexibility in diagnosis (Special symptom reactions). Although the groupings are largely descriptive, the division has been made partially on the basis of the dynamics of personality development. The Personality pattern disturbances are considered deep seated disturbances, with little room for regression. Personality trait disturbances and Socio-
￼DEFINITION OF TERMS 35
pathic personality disturbances under stress may at times regress to a lower level of personality organization and function without development of psychosis.
000-x40 PERSONALITY PATTERN DISTURBANCE
These are more or less cardinal personality types, which can rarely if ever be altered in their inherent structures by any form of therapy. Their func- tioning may be improved by prolonged therapy, but basic change is seldom accomplished. In some, "constitutional" features are marked and obvious. The depth of the psychopathology here allows these individuals little room to maneuver under conditions of stress, except into actual psychosis.
000-x41 Inadequate personality
Such individuals are characterized by inadequate response to intellectual, emotional, social, and physical demands. They are neither physically nor mentally grossly deficient on examination, but they do show inadaptability, ineptness, poor judgment, lack of physical and emotional stamina, and social incompatibility.
000-x42 Schizoid personality
Inherent traits in such personalities are (1) avoidance of close relations with others, (2) inability to express directly hostility or even ordinary aggres- sive feelings, and (3) autistic thinking. These qualities result early in cold- ness, aloofness, emotional detachment, fearfulness, avoidance of competition, and day dreams revolving around the need for omnipotence. As children, they are usually quiet, shy, obedient, sensitive and rearing. At puberty, they frequently become more withdrawn, then manifesting the aggregate of personality traits known as introversion, namely, quietness, seclusiveness, "shut-in-ness," and unsociability, often with eccentricity.
000-x43 Cyclothymia personality
Such individuals are characterized by an extratensive and outgoing adjust- ment to life situations, an apparent personal warmth, friendliness and super- ficial generosity, an emotional reaching out to the environment, and a ready enthusiasm for competition. Characteristic are frequently alternating moods of elation and sadness, stimulated apparently by internal factors rather than
￼36 MENTAL DISORDERS
by external events. The individual may occasionally be either persistently euphoric or depressed, without falsification or distortion of reality. The diagnosis in such cases should specify, if possible, whether hypomanic, depressed or alternating.
000-x44 Paranoid personality
Such individuals are characterized by many traits of the schizoid personal- ity, coupled with an exquisite sensitivity in interpersonal relations, and with a conspicuous tendency to utilize a projection mechanism, expressed by suspiciousness, envy, extreme jealousy and stubbornness.
000-x50 PERSONALITY TRAIT DISTURBANCE
This category applies to individuals who are unable to maintain their emotional equilibrium and independence under minor or major stress because of disturbances in emotional development. Some individuals fall into thii group because their personality pattern disturbance is related to fixation and exaggeration of certain character and behavior patterns; others, because their behavior is a regressive reaction due to environmental or endopsychic stress.
This classification will be applied only to cases of personality disorder in which the neurotic features (such as anxiety, conversion, phobia, etc.) are relatively insignificant, and the basic personality maldevelopment is the crucial distinguishing factor. Evidence of physical immaturity may or may not be present.
000-x51 Emotionally unstable personality
In such cases the individual reacts with excitability and ineffectiveness when confronted by minor stress. His judgment may be undependable under stress, and his relationship to other people is continuously fraught with fluctuating emotional attitudes, because of strong and poorly controlled hostility, guilt, and anxiety.
This term is synonymous with the former term "psychopathic personality with emotional instability."
000-x52 Passive-aggressive personality
Reactions in this group are of three types, as indicated below, and the diagnosis can be further elaborated, if desired, by adding the specific type
￼DEFINITION OF TERMS 37
of reaction observed. However, the three types of reaction are manifestation* of the same underlying psychopathology, and frequently occur interchange- ably in a given individual falling in this category. For these reasons, the reactions are classified together. The clinical picture in such cases often has, superimposed upon it, anxiety reaction which is typically psychoneurotic (see Qualifying Phrases).
Passive-dependent type: This reaction is characterized by helplessness, indecisiveness, and a tendency to cling to others as a dependent child to a supporting parent.
Passive-aggressive type: The aggressiveness is expressed in these reactions by passive measures, such as pouting, stubbornness, procrastination, ineffi- ciency, and passive obstructionism.
Aggressive type: A persistent reaction to frustration with irritability,tem- per tantrums, and destructive behavior is the dominant manifestation. A specific variety of this reaction is a morbid or pathological resentment. A deep dependency is usually evident in such cases. The term does not apply to cases more accurately classified as Antisocial reaction.
000-x53 Compulsive personality
Such individuals are characterized by chronic, excessive, or obsessive con cern with adherence to standards of conscience or of conformity. They may be overinhibited, overconscientious, and may have an inordinate capacity for work. Typically they are rigid and lack a normal capacity for relaxation. While their chronic tension may lead to neurotic illness, this is not an in- variable consequence. The reaction may appear as a persistence of an ado- lescent pattern of behavior, or as a regression from more mature functioning as a result of stress.
000-x5y Personality trait disturbance, other
This category is included to permit greater latitude in diagnosis. Instances in which a personality trait is exaggerated as a means to life adjustment (as in the above diagnoses), not classifiable elsewhere, may be listed here.
This category is designed also for the use of record librarians and statis- ticians dealing with incomplete diagnoses. It is not intended for use with "mixed" states, which are to be properly diagnosed according to the pre- dominant trait disturbance.
￼38 MENTAL DISORDERS
000-X 60 SodOP A THIC PERSONALITY DISTURBANCE
Individuals to be placed in this category are ill primarily in terms of society and of conformity with the prevailing cultural milieu, and not only in terms of personal discomfort and relations with other individuals. How- ever, sociopathic reactions are very often symptomatic of severe underlying personality disorder, neurosis, or psychosis, or occur as the result of organic brain injury or disease. Before a definitive diagnosis in this group is em- ployed, strict attention must be paid to the possibility of the presence of a more primary personality disturbance; such underlying disturbance will be diagnosed when recognized. Reactions will be differentiated as defined below.
000-x61 Antisocial reaction
This term refers to chronically antisocial individuals who are always in trouble, profiting neither from experience nor punishment, and maintaining no real loyalties to any person, group, or code. They are frequently callous and hedonistic, showing marked emotional immaturity, with lack of sense of responsibility, lack of judgment, and an ability to rationalize their behavior so that it appears warranted, reasonable, and justified.
The term includes cases previously classified as "constitutional psycho- pathic state" and "psychopathic personality." As defined here the term is more limited, as well as more specific in its application.
OOQ-x62 Dyssocial reaction
This term applies to individuals who manifest disregard for the usual social codes, and often come in conflict with them, as the result of having lived all their lives in an abnormal moral environment. They may be capable of strong loyalties. These individuals typically do not show signifi- cant personality deviations other than those implied by adherence to the values or code of their own predatory, criminal, or other social group. The term includes such diagnoses as "pseudosocial personality" and "psychopathic personality with asocial and amoral trends."
OOQ-x63 Sexual deviation
This diagnosis is reserved for deviant sexuality which is not symptomatic of more extensive syndromes, such as schizophrenic and obsessional reactions.
￼DEFINITION OF TERMS 39
The term includes most of the cases formerly classed as "psychopathic personality with pathologic sexuality." The diagnosis will specify the type of the pathologic behavior, such as homosexuality, transvestism, pedophilia, fetishism and sexual sadism (including rape, sexual assault, mutilation).
000-x64 Addiction
Addictions will be classified as defined below.
000-x641 Alcoholism
Included in this category will be cases in which there is well established addiction to alcohol without recognizable underlying disorder. Simple drunkenness and acute poisoning due to alcohol are not included in this category.
000-x642 Drug addiction
Drug addiction is usually symptomatic of a personality disorder, and will
be classified here while the individual is actually addicted; the proper personality classification is to be made as an additional diagnosis. Drug addictions symptomatic of organic brain disorders, psychotic disorders, psy- chophysiologic disorders, and psychoneurotic disorders are classified here as a secondary diagnosis.
000-x70 SPECIAL SYMPTOM REACTIONS
This category is useful in occasional situations where a specific symptom is the single outstanding expression of the psychopathology. This term will not be used as a diagnosis, however, when the symptoms are associated with, or are secondary to, organic illnesses and defects, or to other psychiatric disorders. Thus, for example, the diagnosis Special symptom reaction, speech disturbance would be used for certain disturbances in speech in which there are insufficient other symptoms to justify any other definite diagnosis. This type of speech disturbance often develops in childhood. It would not be used for a speech impairment that was a temporary symptom of conversion hysteria or the result of any organic disease or defect.
The diagnosis should specify the particular "habit." (000-x71 Learning disturbance; OOQ-x72 Speech disturbance; 000-x73 Enuresis; 000-x74 Som- nambulism; 000-x7y Other.)
￼40 MENTAL DISORDERS
TRANSIENT SITUA TIONAL PERSONALITY DISORDERS
This general classification should be restricted to reactions which are more or less transient in character and which appear to be an acute symptom response to a situation without apparent underlying personality disturbance.
The symptoms are the immediate means used by the individual in his struggle to adjust to an overwhelming situation. In the presence of good adaptive capacity, recession of symptoms generally occurs when the situa- tional stress diminishes. Persistent failure to resolve will indicate a more severe underlying disturbance and will be classified elsewhere.
000-x80 T ransient situational personality disturbance
Transient situational disorders which cannot be given a more definite diagnosis in the group, because of their fluidity, or because of the limitation of time permitted for their study, may be included in this general category. This category is designed also for the use of record librarians and statisticians dealing with incomplete diagnoses.
000-x81 Gross stress reaction
Under conditions of great or unusual stress, a normal personality may utilize established patterns of reaction to deal with overwhelming fear. The patterns of such reactions differ from those of neurosis or psychosis chiefly with respect to clinical history, reversibility of reaction, and its transient character. When promptly and adequately treated, the condition may clear rapidly. It is also possible that the condition may progress to one of the neurotic reactions. If the reaction persists, this term is to be regarded as a temporary diagnosis to be used only until a more definitive diagnosis is established.
This diagnosis is justified only in situations in which the individual has been exposed to severe physical demands or extreme emotional stress, such as in combat or in civilian catastrophe (fire, earthquake, explosion, etc.). In many instances this diagnosis applies to previously more or less "normal" persons who have experienced intolerable stress.
The particular stress involved will be specified as (1) combat or (2) civilian catastrophe.
￼DEFINITION OF TERMS 41 000-x82 Adult situational reaction
This diagnosis is to be used when the clinical picture is primarily one of superficial maladjustment to a difficult situation or to newly experienced environmental factors, with no evidence of any serious underlying personality defects or chronic patterns. It may be manifested by anxiety, alcoholism, asthenia, poor efficiency, low morale, unconventional behavior, etc. If untreated or not relieved such reactions may, in some instances, progress into typical psychoneurotic reactions or personality disorders. This term will also include some cases formerly classified as "simple adult mal- adjustment."
000-x83 Adjustment reaction of infancy
Under this term are to be classified those transient reactions in infants occurring on a psychogenic basis without organic disease. In most instances these will be outgrowths of the infant's interaction with significant persons in the environment or a response to the lack of such persons. Undue apathy, undue excitability, feeding and sleeping difficulties are common manifesta- tions of such psychic disturbances in infants.
000-x84 Adjustment reaction of childhood
Under this heading are included only the transient symptomatic reactions of children to some immediate situation or internal emotional conflict. The more prolonged and definitive disturbances will be classified elsewhere.
Although the symptomatic manifestations are usually mixed, one type of manifestation may predominate. This group may be subclassified according to the most prominent manifestations as follows:
000-x841 Habit disturbance
When the transient reaction manifests itself primarily as a so-called "habit" disturbance, such as repetitive, simple activities, it may be subclassified here. Indicate symptomatic manifestations under this diagnosis; for example,
nail biting, thumb sucking, enuresis, masturbation, tantrums, etc.
000-x842 Conduct disturbance
When the transient reaction manifests itself primarily as a disturbance in social conduct or behavior, it will be classified here. Manifestations may
￼42 MENTAL DISORDERS
occur chiefly in the home, in the school, or in the community, or may occur in all three. Conduct disturbances are to be regarded as secondary phenom- ena when seen in cases of mental deficiency, epilepsy, epidemic encephalitis, and other well-recognized organic diseases.
Indicate symptomatic manifestations under this diagnosis; for example, truancy, stealing, destructiveness, cruelty, sexual offenses, use of alcohol, etc.
000-x843 Neurotic traits
When the transient reaction manifests itself primarily as physical or emotional symptoms, it will be classified here. Care must be taken to dif- ferentiate these transitory situational responses from the psychoneurotic reactions.
Neurotic traits are closely related to habit disturbances and a distinction between the two is not always possible or desirable. Tics of organic origin should be classified under organic nervous diesase.
Under this diagnosis indicate symptomatic manifestations; for example, t-ics, habit spasms, somnambulism, stammering, over-activity,phobias, etc.
000-x85 Adjustment reaction of adolescence
Under this diagnosis are to be included those transient reactions of the adolescent which are the expression of his emancipatory strivings and vacilla- tions with reference to impulses and emotional tendencies. The superficial pattern of the behavior may resemble any of the personality or psychoneu- rotic disorders. Differentiation between transient adolescent reactions and deep-seated personality trait disorders or psychoneurotic reactions must be made.
000-x86 Adjustment reaction of late life
Under this diagnosis will be included those transient reactions of later life which are an expression of the problems of physiological, situational, and environmental readjustment. Involutional physiological changes, retirement from work, breaking up of families through death, or other life situation changes frequently precipitate transient undesirable personality disturbances, or accentuate previous personality disorders. Such disturbances arc to be differentiated from other psychogenic reactions and from reactions associated with cerebral arteriosclerosis, pre-senile psychosis, and other organic disorders.
￼DEFINITION OF TERMS 43 NON-DIAGNOSTIC TERMS FOR HOSPITAL RECORD
These terms are included in the Standard Nomenclature of Diseases and Operations, and reprinted here for the use of hospitals in completing records and statistics. The reprinted list represents only a portion of those listed in the Standard Nomenclature, but includes the terms most commonly used by hospitals for mental disease and psychiatric services in general hospitals. The terms Diagnosis deferred, Disease none, Examination only, Experiment only, Observation, and Tests only, must be elaborated by the addition of explanatory phrases, such as, Observation (psychiatric).
The terms themselves are self-explanatory. In the six diagnoses listed in the preceding paragraph, it is necessary to change the code number to indi- cate more specifically the cause of hospital admission. The Psychobiologic Unit takes a first code number of 0 . . The y must be retained in the first three digits, hence is moved to second position when the first digit is changed to indicate the Psychobiologic Unit. The diagnosis, Observation, Psychiatric, then receives the code number of Oy0-001. Similarly, observation for disease of the nervous system will be recorded as 9yO-001, Observation, Neurological. Admission for psychological tests will be recorded under OyO-003, Tests only
(psychological tests).
￼SECTION III
RECORDING OF PSYCHIATRIC CONDITIONS
A. General Requirements
1. Lowest sub-classification to be used in recording diagnoses: The specific psychiatric conditions (reactions) are sufficiently well defined to justify their use' without inclusion of the terms indicating the broader generic groups
(disorders). In recording a psychiatric condition, the lowest sub-classification of the disorder will be used without being prefaced by generic terms such as "Personality disorder," "psychoneurosis" (psychoneurotic disorder), "Psy- chosis" (psychotic disorder), or to intermediate classifications such as "Per- sonality pattern" and "Sociopathic personality." Examples:
(a) Schizophrenic reaction, catatonic type.
(b) Psychophysiologic gastro-intestinal reaction.
(c) Phobic reaction.
(d) Paranoid personality.
(e) Adjustment reaction of childhood: conduct disturbance.
2. Qualifying terms: In addition to the diagnostic term used for specifying the particular psychiatric condition, the diagnosis may also include terms qualifying the severity of the condition. The term "severity" refers to the seriousness of the condition. It will not be determined solely by the degree of ineffectiveness, since other factors, such as underlying attitudes, or other psychiatric or physical conditions might have contributed to the total ineffec- tiveness. Severity will be described as "mild," "moderate," or "severe." Such terms as "moderately severe" or "mildly severe" are not sanctioned. Out- standing or conspicuous symptomatology may be added to the diagnosis as manifestations. Example: "Anxiety reaction, mild, manifested by loss of appetite and insomnia."
3. Order of diagnosis: The general principles for recording diagnoses as prescribed in the Standard Nomenclature of Diseases and Operations apply to the recording of psychiatric diagnoses. The immediate condition which necessitated the current admission of the patient will be considered as the primary cause of admission, and so recorded. In cases of several related conditions simultaneously necessitating treatment or hospitalization, the condition which is first in the chain of etiology will be designated as the
44
￼RECORDING OF PSYCHIA TRIC CONDITIONS 45
primary cause of admission. For unrelated conditions simultaneously neces- sitating treatment or hospitalization, the most serious condition will be re- corded as the primary cause of admission. Within the limits of these general principles the following specific conditions will be considered with respect to cases involving psychiatric disorders.
(a) Unrelated diagnoses:
Physical and mental disorders may coexist but be causally unrelated. In such instances all conditions will be listed as separate diagnoses with the primary diagnosis being selected as above.
(b) Related diagnoses:
Physical and mental disorders may coexist and be causally related. The nature of the coexisting conditions determines whether the conditions will be recorded as separate diagnoses or as only one diagnosis.
(1) Related conditions requiring only one diagnosis:
In some instances, the mental reaction, although related to the physical disorder, is not sufficiently developed as a clinical psychiatric entity to require a formal psychiatric diagnosis. For example, a patient with pneumonia may be apprehensive and tense. While this mental status should be described in the patient's clinical history, or in his physical examination, along with any other symptoms or signs, on the individual medical record, the diagnosis will state only the non-psychiatric condition.
There are other instances where physical and mental disorders may coexist and where the physical disorder is a manifestation of the psychiatric con- dition, rather than a separate condition. Whenever this is true, only the psychiatric condition will be listed as a diagnosis, and the physical condition will be shown by a supplementary term. Example: Psychophysiologic skin reaction, severe (pruritis ani).
(2) Related conditions requiring separate diagnoses:
Physical and mental disorders may coexist and be causally related, with both conditions being sufficiently marked and well defined to justify sepa- rate diagnoses. In such cases the causal relationship of the diagnoses should be indicated. The condition which caused or directly led to the other con- dition will precede the other condition in the order of diagnoses. This diagnostic procedure will be followed despite the fact that the psychiatric symptomatology is related to personality factors which existed prior to the immediate physical disease or trauma. For example in the illustration above
￼46 MENTAL DISORDERS
[Paragraph (b) (1)], should the state of apprehension or tension associated with pneumonia progress to a severe delirium, the double condition will require separate diagnoses of "Pneumonia, etc." and "Acute Brain Syndrome associated with systemic infection, pneumonia."
(3) Multiple psychiatric diagnoses:
(a) Whenever two separate psychiatric conditions exist, such as Acute Brain Syndrome, drug or poison intoxication, and Depressive reac- tion, both will be recorded. If a diagnostic entity (which would be recorded as the only diagnosis, if encountered as an isolated personality disturbance) is a part of a more extensive process or secondary to it, the primary condi- tion will be recorded as the diagnosis, with the less important or secondary condition given as a manifestation. Examples:
(1) Anxiety reaction manifested by somnambulism.
(2) Passive-aggressive reaction, manifested by enuresis.
(b) Some psychiatric diagnoses are incompatible with certain other diagnoses and will not be recorded as existing together, such as psycho- neurotic and psychotic reactions. Many conditions may progress from one to another but are not present simultaneously. Only one type of psychoneu- rotic reaction will be used as a diagnosis, even in the presence of symptoms of another type. The diagnosis will be based on the predominant type, followed by a statement of its manifestations, including symptoms of the other types of of reaction. Examples:
(1) Anxiety reaction with minor conversion symptom.
(2) Phobic reaction, manifested by claustrophobia, with ob- sessive-compulsive symptoms, counting and recurring
thoughts.
B. Special Requirements
1. General.
The general requirements outlines above for the recording of diagnoses for statistical purposes, apply also to the recording of diagnoses on the clinical records. In view of the fact, however, that the clinical records fulfill wider function than the statistical records, the mere stating of the diagnosis (includ- ing its qualifying terms) is not sufficient for certain conditions, since it docs not furnish enough information to describe the clinical picture. For example, a diagnosis "Anxiety reaction" does not convey whether the illness has oc-
￼RECORDING OF PSYCHIA TRIC CONDITIONS 47
curred in a previously normal or previously neurotic personality. Further- more, it does not indicate the degree and nature of the external stress nor does it reveal the extremely important information as to the degree to which the patient's functional capacity has been impaired by the psychiatric condi- tion. Therefore, for most conditions a complementary evaluation must be entered in the clinical records. This additional evaluation will consist of the following elements:
(a) External precipitating stress.
(b) Premorbid personality and predisposition. (c) Degree of psychiatric impairment.
Under this system the diagnosis becomes one of four factors to be considered in evaluating a case. It is essential to recognize that the time element is all- important in this evaluation. The diagnostic formulation on any particular date may be changed on a subsequent date. A patient may show severe im- pairment of function upon admission but at the time of discharge may have mild or no impairment. For this reason, it is essential that a beginning and terminating evaluation be recorded in each case. Degree of impairment is not synonymous with the terms, "Recovered," "Improved," and "Unim- proved." The latter terms are more inclusive, inasmuch as they indicate a change in the patient's total condition over a period of time.
2. Conditions Requiring Complementary Diagnostic Evaluation.
All disorders in this nomenclature will be given complementary diagnostic
evaluation except those grouped under Mental Deficiency.
3. External Precipitating Stress.
While it is recognized that multicausal factors operate, the apparent or obvious external stress precipitating the condition is to be evaluated as to type, degree, and duration. The stress will generally refer to the immediate emotional, economic, environmental, or cultural situation which is directly related to the reaction manifest in the patient. Unconscious internal con- flicts are not to be considered as external stress. Whenever the stress cannot be determined, it should be recorded as "undetermined." The degree of stress must be evaluated in terms of its effect on the "average man" of the society from which the patient comes. It must not be presumed that a par- ticular environmental stress is severe because of one or even several indi- viduals reacting poorly to it, since these individuals may have had poor
￼48 MENTAL DISORDERS
resistance to that particular stress. Stress will be classified as "none," "mild," "moderate," or "severe." Severe stress is such that the average individual when exposed to it could be expected to develop psychiatric symptoms. Moderate stress is such that some evidence of a causal relationship can be established between the symptoms and the precipitating factors. Mild stress is such that the average individual could be exposed to it without developing psychiatric symptoms. In classifying the stress according to one of these terms, the actual stress should be described in a brief phrase in order to allow more accurate evaluation of the case. Example: "Moderate stress (business failure)."
4. Pre-Morbid Personality and Predisposition.
The description of predisposition will consist of the patient's outstanding personality traits or weaknesses, which have resulted from inheritance and development, and an evaluation of the degree of this predisposition based on the patient's past history and personality traits. Frequently, the premorbid personality may be such that classification can be made as one of the per- sonality disorders. When the predisposition cannot be determined, it will be recorded as "undetermined." The degree of predisposition will be reported as "none," "mild," "moderate," or "severe."
(a) None: No predisposition evident. This description will be used when the patient shows no evidence of previous personality traits or make-up appearing to be related to his present illness (and when there has been no positive history of a mental illness in the immediate family).
(b) Mild predisposition: This description will be used when the patient's history reveals mild, transient, emotional upsets, and/or abnormal personality traits or defects of intelligence which, however, do not significantly inca- pacitate or did not require medical care. (It will be used also where there is a past history of mental illness in the patient's family.) Examples: History of mild, transient, psychoneurotic reaction or mild personality disorder, or borderline mental deficiency.
(c) Moderate predisposition. This description will be used when the patient has a personal history of partially incapacitating emotional upsets, or definitely abnormal personality traits, or defects in intelligence, which have resulted in social maladjustment. Examples: Mild, chronic, psycho- neurotic reaction; moderate psychoneurotic reaction of limited duration; mental deficiency of mild degree.
(d) Severe predisposition. This description will be used in the presence of a definite history of previous overt mental disorder. Examples: Definite
￼RECORDING OF PSYCHIATRIC CONDITIONS 49
psychotic reaction, moderate or severe chronic psychoneurotic reaction, marked degree of personality disorder, moderate or marked mental deficiency.
5. Degree of Psychiatric Impairment.
The psychiatric impairment represents the degree to which the indi- vidual's total functional capacity is affected by the psychiatric condition. This is not necessarily the same as general ineffectiveness. The degree of effectiveness in any particular job is a result of the individual's emotional stability, intellect, physical condition, attitudes, motivation, training, etc., as well as of the degree and type of his psychiatric impairment. Under some circumstances, an individual with a moderate psychiatric impairment may be more effective than another individual with a minimal impairment. De- gree of impairment, as used here, refers only to ineffectiveness resulting from the current psychiatric impairment.
The degree of the impairment at the time of original consultation or admission will often vary from the degree of impairment after treatment. Impairment after termination of treatment represents the residual or persis- tent impairment. Depending on the degree of the impairment, it will be recorded as, "No Impairment," "Minimal Impairment," "Mild Impairment," "Moderate Impairment," "Severe Impairment." The individual's pre-illness capacity in terms of occupational and social adjustment will be used as a base line for estimating the degree of impairment.
(a) No impairment.
This term will be used whenever there are no medical reasons for changing employment or life situation.
(b) Minimal impairment.
This term will be used to indicate incapacity of perceptible degree and, in terms of percentage, not to exceed 10%.
(c) Mild impairment.
This term will be used to indicate impairment in social and occupational adjustment, such as a 20 to 30% disability.
(d) Moderate impairment.
This term will be used to indicate a degree of impairment which seriously, but not totally, interferes with the patient's ability to carry on his pre-illness social and vocational adjustment, such as a 30 to 50% disability.

(e) Severe impairment.
This term will be used to indicate a degree of impairment which for practical purposes prevents a patient from functioning at his pre-illness social and vocational levels. Over 50% disability.

SECTION IV
STATISTICAL REPORTING
A. BASIC PRINCIPLES
There is an increasing need for adequate statistical data on the mental hospital population of the country. As a result, many State hospital systems have expressed a desire for guidance in the development of statistical systems.
On the basis of the records described in the Statistical Manual for the Use of Hospitals for Mental Disease,1 and modifications of them, several States already have developed extensive record systems which include procedures for establishing punch card files and for carrying out machine tabulations. These State systems are not identical in their details of operation or in the record forms used. Nevertheless, they all have certain elements in common and can yield certain common types of basic statistical information.
The following discussion is not intended to serve as an operations manual. Its purpose is to provide a guide line to those States and hospitals that con- template organizing or revising their statistical systems by focusing attention on the minimum elements found in existing State systems which are essential to adequate reporting. Persons interested in obtaining operating details may do so by writing to the Mental Hospital Authorities in the States listed in Appendix D for copies of manuals which describe their reporting systems, forms, punch cards, codes and machine tabulating procedures.
A primary requisite in the establishment of a reporting system is that the basic objectives of the system should be clearly stated at the outset. With these objectives in mind, the system should be set up and kept in operation by a person who is familiar with statistical methods, preferably a trained statistician with some experience in the application of statistical methods to hospital and public health problems. Such a person can design record forms and procedures needed to collect pertinent data, can set up the appropriate tabulations needed to answer specific questions, and can analyze the data adequately. There are available sorting and tabulating machines (such as International Business Machines and Remington Rand Powers Equipment)

which help produce tacts rapidly and accurately by eliminating tedious hand operations and which make possible certain operations and tabulations that are impractical to carry out by hand. It should be kept in mind, however, that such machines arc not a substitute for the well-trained statistician but merely a tool to help the statistician perform the sorting and other operations incidental to obtaining the necessary tabulations.
A reporting system does not have to be complex to be effective. An efficient reporting system can be designed to provide basic facts concerning the admissions, patients under treatment, discharges, and deaths by having a limited number of basic variables reported to a central office for every patient admitted to the hospital system. For example, the following items should be reported at time of admission:
(1) Patient's name
(2) Residence (street address, city or town, county, state)
(3) Serial number assigned to patient
(4) Hospital to which admitted
(5) Date of current admission
(6) Birth date (month, day, year)
(7) Age (last birthday) on admission
(8) Sex (male, female)
(9) Race (White, Negro, American Indian, Chinese, Japanese, etc.)
(10) Marital status (single,-married, widowed, divorced, separated)
(11) Admission status (first, readmission, transfer)
(12) Type of commitment2 (voluntary; medical certification, standard
nonjudicial procedure; medical certification, emergency procedure; without medical certification, emergency procedure; court order, judicial procedure)
(13) Mental disorder.
The following facts should be reported subsequent to admission at the time each event occurs:
(1) Changes in diagnosis
(2) Dates of placement on trial visit, family care or temporary visit and
return from such leave
(3) Dates of escape and return from escape (4) Dates of transfer
'These terms are the ones used in the Draft Act Governing Hospitalization of the Mentally III, Federal Security Agency, Public Health Service, Publication No. 51. Types of commitment procedures practiced in a given State can be substituted for these.
￼54
MENTAL DISORDERS
(5) Date of discharge and whether discharge is from hospital direct, trial visit, family care, temporary visit or while otherwise absent
(6) Date of death and whether death occurred in hospital, on trial visit,
family care, temporary visit, or while otherwise absent (7) Causes of death."
These items should be collected on a single card, such as is shown in figure 1. Included on the card are several other items which may be found useful for identification or other purposes such as religion, usual occupation,4 business or industry, veteran status, social security number, patient's birthplace, parents' names and birthplaces. Spaces arc also provided for recording the degree of psychiatric impairment patient was found to have at time of admission, discharge, and intermediate dates as well as the outcome of hospitalization.
It should be pointed out that certain basic facts are needed on the book population of the hospital—that is, the residents in hospital and patients on trial visit, family care, escape, etc.—as of the date the reporting system starts. To obtain these facts entails carrying out a census of the book popula- tion as of the appropriate date (for example, January 1), recording for these individuals the same items as are to be obtained on the patients admitted after that date. By making the appropriate additions to and subtractions from
8 Causes of death should be recorded in the same manner as on the Medical Certification Sec- tion of the Standard Certificate of Death. For information on the completion of this section of the death certificate see "Physicians Handbook on Death and Birth Registration/' 10th Edition, Government Printing Office, Washington 25, D. C. (15 cents.) The classification of causes of death for statistical tabulation should be done in accordance with the "International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Injuries and Causes of Death." Volume I includes an Introduction, List of Categories, Tabular List of Inclusions, a section on medical certification and rules for classification, and special lists for tabulation purposes. Volume II is the Alphabetical Index to the List. The index is a working tool for use in coding medical records and death certificates. The manual also contains rules for uniform selection of underlying cause of death and three lists recommended for use by all member nations of the World Health Organization in tabulat- ing morbidity and mortality data. The manual can be obtained from the Columbia University Press, International Documents Service, 2960 Broadway, New York 27, N. Y.
* "Usual occupation" refers to the occupation the patient pursued for the longest part of his working life. It is the one occupation out of several the patient may have had that accounted for the greatest number of years of his working life. This item and "kind of business or industry" are useful for identification and, if death occurs, for completing the death certificate. It is also of some use in research, although studies of association between occupation and mental illness would probably require detailed occupational histories. If the patient was retired prior to hos- pitalization, enter his usual occupation and industry in items 12 and 13 and insert "ret" after the usual occupation. For more specific details regarding terms to be used in the recording of occupation and industry see "Guide for Reporting Occupation and Industry on Death Certifi- cates" issued by the Public Health Service, National Office of Vital Statistics, Washington 25, D. C., and "Alphabetical Index of Occupations and Industries," Bureau of the Census, Wash- ington 25, D. C.
￼STATISTICAL REPORTING 55
the various categories of patients, it is then possible to keep the book popu- lation up-to-date.
If additional information is desired, as for example on the type of therapy each patient receives, the occurrence of non-psychiatric illness such as cancer, tuberculosis, diabetes, etc., the form could be enlarged to provide additional fields for such data or special forms could be designed to obtain such data which could later be collated with the basic record outlined above.
From the basic facts collected on the patients the following kinds of statis- tical tabulations may be obtained (these tables are set up in outline form at the end of this Section):
(1) Gross movement table which tells how many patients are admitted to, die in, or are discharged from the hospital, how many are on trial visit, escape, etc. These data are needed to compute crude separation, discharge and death rates (table 1).
(2) More specific data about the characteristics of the patients who are admitted, discharged, on extramural care (trial visit and family care) or resident in the hospital at the end of the year. For example:
(a) Annual Admissions:
1. By mental disorder, sex, race, age at admission and admission status (table 2)
(b) Annual Discharges:
1. By mental disorder, sex, race, age at discharge and admission status (table 3)
2. By mental disorder, sex, race, admission status and net length of time in hospital for this admission (table 4)
3. By mental disorder, sex, race and condition on discharge (table 5)
(c) Annual Deaths:
1. By mental disorder, sex, race, age at death and admission status (table 6)
2. By mental disorder, sex, race, admission status and net length of time in hospital for this admission (table 7)
(d) Resident Patients at the End of the Year:
1. By mental disorder, sex, race, and age at the end of the year (table 8)
2. By mental disorder, sex, race and time on books (table 9)

(3) Data that tell what happens to a cohort of patients admitted in a specific year, i.e., follow-up data on a group of annual admissions to deter- mine how many of the first admissions of 1948, for example, were in the hospital, discharged, on trial visit, in family care or otherwise absent or dead twelve months following their date of admission, by such factors as mental disorder, sex, and race (table 12).
Additional tables can be prepared that may be useful for administrative and other purposes within a State hospital system. For example:
(a) Resident population as of end of year by county of residence at time of admission, and sex with corresponding rates per 100,000 population
(b) Annual first admissions and readmissions to State mental hospitals by county of residence and sex with corresponding rates per 100,000 population
(c) Overcrowding: Excess of average daily resident patients over rated capacity of hospital
(d) Administrative staff, full-time, by occupation and ratio of patients to various occupational categories as for example, physicians, nurses, attendants and social workers.
Actual examples of tabulations such as those mentioned above may be obtained by writing to the State Mental Hospital Authority in the list of States in Appendix D for copies of their annual reports or to the Biometrics Branch, National Institute of Mental Health of the Public Health Service.
The annual reports of New York, New Jersey, Virginia and California and the monthly bulletin of the Ohio Department of Public Welfare are particularly useful in this respect.5 Mention should also be made of the annual Census of Patients in Mental Institutions, issued by the National
•The Ohio Bulletin for the months of May 1947, May 1948 and May 1949, and a paper in the American Journal of Psychiatry, Vol. 104, No. 9, March 1948, "New Facts on Prognosis in Mental Disease," by Robert H. Israel, M.D. and Nelson A. Johnson, B.A., contain good examples of tabulations that show the status of a group of annual admissions on the anniversary of their admission.

1. Movement of population by sex
2. First admissions by sex, age and mental disorder
3. Discharges by sex, mental disorder and condition on discharge 4. Administrative stafl as of end of year
5. Expenditures by purpose.
Copies of the Census and of Mental Health Statistics—Current Reports, a series of special studies on mental hospital data and other pertinent subjects may be obtained from the National Institute of Mental Health, Public Health Service, Bethesda 14, Maryland.
Outpatient Psychiatric Clinics
Relatively little has been done in the development of statistical reporting and record systems in outpatient psychiatric clinics. Several States have instituted reporting systems, in particular, California, New York, Ohio, Michigan, New Jersey and Virginia. Copies of record forms and operating manuals may be obtained by writing to the Mental Hospital Authority in each of these States (Appendix D). In the interim, operational information will be collected by the Biometrics Branch, National Institute of Mental Health, and may be obtained, as it becomes available, by letter to that agency.
It is anticipated that in the next few years more work will be done in the development of this important area of psychiatric statistics. As additional data become availablethey will be collected for publicationin future manuals.
B. SUGGESTEDTABULATIONS
Definitions of Terms in Movement Table
First Admission: A patient admitted for the first time to any hospital for the treatment of mental disease, except institutions for temporary care only.
Readmission: A patient admitted who has previously been under treatment in a hospital for mental disease, excepting transfers and those who have been hospitalized only in institutions for temporary care.
Transfer: A patient brought directly from one hospital to another without a break in custody and without being formally discharged from the first hospital and formally admitted by the second.
Trial visit (conditional discharge, convalescent status, convalescent care,
￼60 MENT AL DISORDERS
indefinite leave): 'Status of patients absent from the hospital but still on the books or in its custody.

Ajl first admissions occurring during a given year are considered a cohort. Each person in the cohort is traced for a year. The disposition of each individual patient as of the end of 12 months following admission to the State hospital system is recorded.
1 Similar tabulations should be made separately for white females and for non-white males and females.
* Include first admissions resident in the hospital at the end of the 12 month period following admission. Patients on temporary visit are considered as4in residence.
Include only first admissions discharged from the books of the hospital within the 12 month period following admission.
' Include first admissions who at the end of the 12 month period following admission are on escape, elopement, or out of the hospital against advice
or authorization and who are not discharged from the hospital books.
•Include only first admissions who died while on the books of the hospital within the 12 month period following admission.
T Include patients who are transferred from one hospital for mental disease to another without a break in custody, that is, without a formal dis-
charge from the first hospital or a formal admission to the second.

￼SECTION V
STATISTICAL CLASSIFICATION OF MENTAL DISORDER
As discussed in Appendix A, the International Statistical Classification,1 1948 revision, has been used to convert the entire Standard Nomenclature into a form suitable for statistical purposes. However, certain problems were encountered in making Section V of the International Classification, which deals with mental, psychoneurotic and personality disorders, conform to the concepts of the Psychobiological Unit of the Standard Nomenclature. For
example, the International Classification provides for the coding of Chronic Brain Syndromes with psychotic reaction associated with various diseases and conditions in terms of psychoses of demonstrable etiology under titles 304-3082 and in titles 020.1, 025, 083.2 and 688.1. It does not provide for coding Chronic Brain Syndrome associated with any disease or condition with neurotic reaction, behavioral reaction or without qualifying phrase except in tide 083.1—postencephalitic, personality and character disorders. Nor docs it provide for coding acute brain syndrome within the group of psychotic conditions, except alcoholic delirium (included in 307) and ex- haustion delirium (included in 309).
In the process of converting the above terms and certain others in the section dealing with Diseases of the Psychobiological Unit to the Inter- national equivalent codes, certain amendments and additional 4-digit sub- divisions and three special 3-digit codes were set up for use with the Standard Nomenclature only. Since it was necessary to stay within the basic frame- work of the International Classification, certain limitations were imposed upon the number of additions that could be made. As a result of these limitations, the International Statistical Classification contains some cate- gories which may be too inclusive for adequate tabulation of diagnostic data, especially with respect to diagnostic distribution of patients under treatment in mental hospitals. For example, the categories 307, 308.1 and 308.5 in the International Statistical Classification include the following diagnoses:
307. Alcoholic Psychosis, includes
(a) Acute Brain Syndrome associated with alcohol intoxication (b) Chronic Brain Syndrome associated with alcohol intoxication
with psychotic reaction.

MENTAL DISORDERS
Psychosis of other demonstrable etiology resulting from epilepsy and other convulsive disorders: includes
(a) Acute Brain Syndrome with convulsive disorder
(b) Chronic Brain Syndrome with convulsive disorder with psychotic reaction.
Acute Brain Syndrome associated with other causes not elsewhere classified includes
Acute Brain Syndrome associated with:
(a) Intracranial infection, except encephalitis (b) Drug or poison intoxication, except alcohol (c) Metabolic disturbance
(d) Diseases of unknown or uncertain cause.
In order to provide mental hospitals with a scheme that permits detailed tabulation of diagnostic data as well as easy contraction of the detailed classi- fication into summary form, a code suitable for machine tabulation has been devised for the titles in the Psychobiological Unit of the Standard Nomen- clature. This is presented in detail at the end of this section. The inclusions for each category are cross-referenced with the appropriate International List and Standard Nomenclature numbers. This code consists of four digits in which the first represents the broad class.of mental disorder; the second, major categories within each of these broad classes; the third, subdivisions within major categories; and the fourth, qualifying phrases where applicable.
The new nomenclature is somewhat of a departure from that being used currently in mental hospitals. The use of the terms acute and chronic brain syndromes is new, as well as the use of the qualifying phrases, with psychotic reaction, with neurotic reaction and with behavioral reaction. In addition, the categories dealing with psychoneuroses, psychophysiologic autonomic and visceral disorders and personality disorders are considerably expanded over what was included in the 1934 Classification of Mental Disorders. Be- cause of these differences between the 1934 Classification of Mental Disorders and the present one, it is desirable for hospitals to classify diagnoses by both codes for at least a year in order to determine what differences the new classification will effect in their historical statistical series dealing with ad- missions, discharges and resident patients by diagnosis.
Below is a scheme for presenting tabulations of mental disorder. The arrangement follows essentially the underlying subdivisions of the new nomenclature.

Where no subdivision exists within a major category the third digit should be punched with an "X" punch. Where no qualifying phrase is applicable the fourth digit should also be punched with an "X" punch, except in the Chronic Brain Syndromes where diagnoses without qualifying phrase are coded "0" in the fourth digit.
2 The abbreviation "pt" following an International List Number means that the Standard Nomenclature dde is only one part of the titles included under the indicated International List Number. For example, International List No. 308.5 Acute Brain Syndrome Associated with Other Causes Not Elsewhere Classified includes the following Standard Nomenclature tides:
Acute Brain Syndrome associated with:
(a) Intracranial infection, except encephalitis (b) Drug or poison intoxication, except alcohol (c) Metabolic disturbance

APPENDIX TO THE STANDARD NOMENCLA TURE AND INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL CLASSIFICATION 1
The Appendix lists in numerical order the whole International Statistical Classifica- tion (numbers at left, in italics) together with the Standard numbers which are included in each International number. There are also included many notes and explanations designed to make it easier to find the correct equivalent International numbers for Standard terms listed in the body of the book.
The following items of general application are important but others throughout the International Statistical Classification as here listed are essential also.
Special Use of Asterisk
* An asterisk on any International number in the sections, Nomenclature of Diseases
and Supplementary terms (pp. 85-505), and in Standard etiologic categories, 1, 2, and 3 (pp. 51-62) indicates that some further explanation is given about that International category in the Appendix.
Symbols and Abbreviations Used in the Appendix
t Indicates some further explanation about this category but it does not change the content or code number of any International category.
ft Indicates an additional 4th digit subdivision to an existing International 3-digit code number which should be earmarked as not part of the official International Classi- fication in any publication of statistics based on this number. The same symbol is used to indicate the following 3-digit codes used in the same way and with the same publica- tion practice: 379, 327, and 325, each of which has the same ten subdivisions, .0-.9.
**Indicates an International category for which there is no directly expressed Standard equivalent. It usually supplies additional detail as to site, type, etc., and is to be used if specified in the diagnosis.
NOS—not otherwise specified. Used when site, etiology, or other item which should be specified has been omitted.
NEC—not elsewhere classified. Used when the term is complete but the disease or injury can be classified in the International only in an indefinite category such as "all other" diseases of a given broad type. These abbreviations are used to avoid repetition of the longer phrases for which they stand.
Statistical Classification and Nomenclature
Classification is fundamental to the quantitative study of any phenomenon. It is recognized as the basis of all scientific generalization and is therefore an essential cle- ment in statistical methodology. Uniform definitions and uniform systems of classi- fication arc prerequisites in the advancement of scientific knowledge. In the study of illness and death, therefore, a standard classification of disease and injury for statistical purposes is essential.2

￼88 MENTAL DISORDERS
The purpose of a statistical classification is often confused with that of a nomenclature. Basically a medical nomenclature is a list or catalogue of approved terms for describing and recording clinical and pathological observations. To serve its full function, it should be extensive, so that any pathological condition can be accurately recorded. As medical science advances, a nomenclature must expand to include new terms necessary to record new observations. Any morbid condition that can be specifically described will need a specific designation in a nomenclature.2
This complete specificity of a nomenclature prevents it from serving satisfactorily as a statistical classification. When one speaks of statistics, it is at once inferred that the interest is in a group of cases and not in individual occurrences. The purpose of a statistical compilation of disease data is primarily to furnish quantitative data that will answer questions about groups of cases.2
A statistical classification of disease must be confined to a limited number of cate- gories which will encompass the entire range of morbid conditions. The categories should be chosen so that they will facilitate the statistical study of disease phenomena. A specific disease entity should have a separate title in the classification only when its separation is warranted because the frequency of its occurrence, or its importance as a morbid condition, justifies its isolation as a separate category. On the other hand, many titles in the classification will refer to groups of separate but usually related morbid conditions. Every disease or morbid condition, however, must have a definite and appropriate place as an inclusion in one of the categories of the statistical classification. A few items of the statistical list will be residual titles for other and miscellaneous con- ditions which cannot be classified under the more specific titles. These miscellaneous categories should be kept to a minimum.2
The construction of a practical scheme of classification of disease and injury for general statistical use involves various compromises. Efforts to provide a statistical classification upon a strictly logical arrangement of morbid conditions have failed in the past. The various titles will represent a series of necessary compromises between classi- fications based on etiology, anatomical site, and circumstance of onset, as well as the quality of information available on medical reports. Adjustments must also be made to meet the varied requirements of vital statistics offices, hospitals of different types, medical services of the armed forces, social insurance organizations, sickness surveys, and numerous other agencies. While no single classification will fit the specialized needs for all these purposes, it should provide a common basis of classification for general statistical use.2
The above paragraphs are taken from the Introduction to the International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Injuries, and Causes of Death, 1948. That list represents the result of much thought and work on the part of many committees and subcommittees, and an assembly of representatives of various countries throughout the world. For the most part these representatives were skilled in statistical methods and the classification of diseases and causes of death for statistical purposes. The two-volume book includes not only a numerical listing of the disease and accident categories with a list of repre- sentative diseases and injuries included under each title, but an extensive alphabetical index of diseases and injuries with the proper code number attached.
Although this International Classification is not infrequently designated as a nomen- clature, it is not and was not intended to serve as a nomenclature. The function of a nomenclature is to train the medical student and practicing physician to use the clearest and most acceptable diagnostic terms to describe a particular clinical case; the function of this coding manual is to aid a capable diagnosis coder or record librarian, with occasional medical advice, to assign the terms and disease names used by the attending
￼APPENDIX A 89
physician to the proper category in the list for the purpose of statistical tabulations. The better the nomenclature'the more accurate will be the assignment of diagnoses for statistical purposes.8
The index to the International Classification includes both good and poor terminology because all diagnoses must be given a code number even when the assignment is to an ill-defined or completely unknown cause. It is designed to help a diagnosis coder after the physician has determined the diagnosis to his satisfaction and has recorded it in the proper hospital, clinic, or private records.
Conversion of Standard Numbers into International Classification Numbers
Some description of the details of the conversion process should be given. The cor- responding International number appears in parentheses and in italics at the right of the Standard title. Usually there will be only one International number for a given Standard term, but occassionally there will be two International numbers, and for neoplasms a few categories have three such numbers. Obviously some footnotes of explanation are needed but to avoid confusion between notes pertaining to the Standard and those pertaining to the International Classification, all such explanations pertaining to International numbers appear in this Appendix (pp. 847-1034).
An asterisk on any number in the body of the Standard means to refer to that Inter- national number as it appears in the Appendix for notes and explanations that may affect the International number to be assigned. Probably the most frequent type of explanation refers to what may be designated as "open-end terms" where some item must be supplied by the attending physician before the term can be coded. Any such "open-end terms" can be given only a more or less ill-defined International number until the missing information is supplied. Reference to the International number in the Appendix supplies one or more other International numbers which may be appropriate and the one selected will depend upon the information supplied by the attending physician.
Uses for the Cross-Classification of Numbers in the Two Systems
The Standard Nomenclature is set up for use by physicians, specialists, and hospitals to secure standard and uniform terminology in the diagnosis of the diseases of individual patients. For that purpose it must be detailed and specific, because the attending physician must record the specific disease which he is treating and cannot be satisfied with knowing only die general or semispecific category of diseases of this kind.
The very specificity and detail of a nomenclature makes it cumbersome as a list of diseases for use in statistical tabulations. As already noted, statistical analysis deals with groups of patients rather than individual therapeutic problems. The clinician's problem is the individual patient but the problems of the epidemiologist and statistician are the "herd" or group, and in studying an outbreak of typhoid, influenza, typhus, or cholera, rneir problem is to find the source of the infection and its mode of spread so the epidemic can be stamped out. In this work they want data on groups of persons and they are more quickly summarized in the form of the International Statistical Classification. With the conversion of the detailed Standard Nomenclature into the shorter International Statistical Classification arranged especially for statistical purposes, one can have the advantages of careful and detailed individual diagnoses classified into useful categories for statistical analysis. Some hospitals and institutions are already converting their records of Standard diagnoses into the International Statistical Classi-
' In part from "Manual for Coding Causes of Illness," Miscellaneous Publication No. 32 of the U. S. Public Health Service. Government Printing Office. Washington. 1944.
￼90 MENTAL DISORDERS
fication for statistical analysis. This dual Standard Manual will make that job much easier, and for those hosptals which record diagnoses on punchcards, both the Standard and the International Statistical Classification numbers can be put on the same card for use of the data according to either classification.
As already noted, the International numbers with their titles are listed in numerical order in the Appendix. With each International number and title there is listed every Standard number to which that particular International number has been assigned. A single International code, such as 753.7—"Other congenital malformations of the nervous system and sense organs," includes a considerable number of Standard diagnosis numbers. This situation arises because the Standard lists a different number and title for each specific diagnosis whether it occurs frequently or infrequently, whereas the International Statistical Classification puts many similar but infrequent diagnoses into one category.
V . MENT AL, PSYCHONEUROTIC, AND PERSONALITY DISORDERS
(ttFor mental disorders classified elsewhere, see Titles 020, 025, 026, 083, 353, 688.1, and 794.)
The International Classification, 1948 Revision, provides for the coding of Chronic Brain Syndrome with psychotic reaction associated with various diseases and conditions in terms of Psychoses of Demonstrable Etiology, under titles 304-308.2, and in titles 020.1, 025, 083.2, and 688.1. It docs not provide for coding Chronic Brain Syndrome associated with any disease or condition with neurotic reaction, behavioral reaction, or without qualifying phrase, except in title 083.1—postencephalitic personality and char- acter disorders. Nor does it provide for coding Acute Brain Syndrome, or acute tem- porary recoverable mental disturbances, within the group of psychotic conditions, except alcoholic delirium (included in 307) and exhaustion delirium (included in 309).
Adjustments In The International Classification To Provide Equivalents For Standard Terms
In the process of converting the revised terminology in Section O—Diseases of the Psychobiological Unit—to the International equivalent codes, certain amendments and additional 4th digit subdivisions and three special 3-digit codes (319, 327, and 325) have been set up, for use with the Standard Nomenclature only. Without these new subdivisions and codes it seemed impossible to maintain the concepts of the Psycho- biological Unit of the Standard Nomenclature.
These codes (with tt)&gt; (p- 847) and any others which are in addition to or an expansion of the existing International codes, should always be indicated as being such in published tabulations making use of them. They are listed, also, in their numerical position throughout the appendix with the Standard code numbers to which they are equivalent.
Agencies who so desire may code also the physical conditions or diseases giving rise to the various types of mental reactions.

￼APPENDIX B
DISEASES OF THE PSYGHOBIOLOGIG UNIT * OF THE NOMENCLATURE OF DISEASE
Psychiatrists and members of associated specialties have considered for many years that the psychiatric nomenclature was inadequate for their needs. The American Psychiatric Association undertook to revise the psychiatric terminology. The efforts of this Association and its members assisted by advice and council of interested individuals, culminated in the establishing of the "Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders" (American Psychiatric Association) in the early part of 1951. During the development of the manual, the editors and the committee on psychiatryof the Standard Nomenclature of Diseases and Opera- tions and the committee assigned the task of developing the mentioned manual were in frequent communication and association. Through their cooperative ac- tivities, the psychiatric nomenclature as listed in the manual was included in the "Fourth" edition of the Standard Nomenclature of Diseases and Operations. This resulted in a radical revision of section 0 "Diseases of the Psychobiologic Unit" of the Nomenclature of Disease.
The major change, of course, was the substitution of the newly accepted termi- nology for the old. Many of the new terms were broader in scope than the old to conform to the basic thinking among psychiatrists that some disorders or re- actions formerly considered as separate clinical entities are really expressions of a single disease. This concept of unity is characteristic of the new terminology. Hence a rubric assigned to a new term may include two or more rubrics of former editions. This is not a violation of the basic principle of Standard that a rubric is specific for one clinical entity, but is acknowledgement of the basic holistic implications of many psychiatric disorders or reactions. For example, the "Fourth" edition has the entity 006-580 Psychophysiologic gastrointestinal reaction which includes the three listings of previous editions of 640-550 Gastric neurosis, 604-550 Intestinal neurosis, and 668-550 Rectal neurosis. These neuroses are now considered to be allied clinical expressions of the same psycho- physiologic autonomic disorder.
A second change is the division of a former Standard rubric into two or more rubrics, thus permitting more refined or detailed classification. An excellent example of this change is the division of the entity of the Third edition, 003-516 Psychosis with cerebral arteriosclerosis. In the "Fourth" edition this entity may be classified into four items, the basic category being chronic brain syndrome associated with cerebral arteriosclerosis 009-516. When the clinical picture is significantly altered by superimposed symptoms, the addition of a qualifying phrase (.xl with psychotic reaction; .x2 with neurotic reaction; .x3 with behavior reaction) provides three additional rubrics.
This change is one of the most significant in this revision as it provides for the flexibility and variation which is so necessary in a psychiatric nomenclature classification.
The basic construction pattern of the Nomenclature of Disease has not been changed. The diseases of the psychobiologic unit are grouped in divisions cor-

￼104 MENTAL DISORDERS
responding to the categories of the etiologic classification and the listing of the clinical entities within the divisions follow the alphabetic arrangement. However, decimal digits with their usually assigned definitions are not used in association with diseases of the psychobiologic unit with the exception of the decimal digit x, disturbance of function and the decimal digit .0 to denote chronic infection.
The decimal digit x is used to denote disturbance of function but has been qualified by the addition of a digit in the second decimal place with assigned definition as follows: .xl with psychotic reaction; .x2 with neurotic reaction; .x3 with behavior reaction; and .x4 with mental deficiency. These qualifying phrases may be added to any diagnosis in the psychobiologic unit when needed to further define, describe or clarify the clinical picture. Care must be exercised in their utilization to prevent redundancy. For example, .xl with psychotic reaction would be redundant when used with a diagnosis listed under psychotic disorders; .x2 would be redundant when used with a diagnosis listed under the psychoneurotic disorders; .x3 when used with a diagnosis of a personality disorder and .x4 when used with the diagnosis of mental deficiency. The use of these decimal combinations may be clarified by considering the use of decimal digit x4 as it relates (1) to a diagnosis other than mental deficiency and (2) to the diagnosis mental deficiency per se.
The rubrics of the diseases of the psychobiologic unit may be qualified by the addition of the decimal digit x4 when necessary to denote mental deficiency as associated with the primary disease. For example, the clinical condition "Chronic brain syndrome associated with trauma" is coded as 009-4 . . If mental deficiency is the major symptom of the disorder and it is desired to indicate this in the diagnosis, the decimal digit x4 may be added to the basic code number, thus, 009-4... x4. Chronic brain syndrome associated with trauma, with mental deficiency.
In the old terminology this diagnosis would have been listed as mental deficiency due to trauma (not birth injury).
The clinical entity "Mental deficiency (familial or hereditary)" is classified in Standard as 000-x90. It becomes immediately obvious that the addition of the decimal digit x4 to this code number, thus 000-x90.x4 is a redundancy, as the diagnosis literally interpreted would be mental deficiency with mental deficiency.
The decimal digit x4 may be further expanded to denote degrees of mental deficiency, thus .x41 with mental deficiency mild; .x42 with mental deficiency moderate; .x43 with mental deficiency severe. For example, "Chronic brain syndrome, associated with trauma, with mental deficiency, mild" would have the code number 009^00.x41.
Mental deficiency per se is recognized also in three degrees, mild, moderate, and severe denoted by the addition of the digits 1, 2 and 3 in the rubric for mental deficiency per se, but these digits are in fourth position of the etiologic portion of the code number and are not decimal digits; thus "Mental deficiency (familial or hereditary) severe" would be coded as 000-x903.
While no provisions have been made for the coding of mild, moderate and severe for the decimal digits xl, x2 and x3, nevertheless if desired by the psy- chiatrist, diagnoses qualified as above and coded with the double decimal combi-
￼APPENDIX B 105
nations added may be recorded with an additional digit in the 3rd decimal place utilizing digit 1 for mild, 2 for moderate and 3 for severe, thus:
.xll with mild psychotic reaction
.x!2 with moderate psychotic reaction .x!3 with severe psychotic reaction.
Diseases of the psychobiologic unit in previous additions were classified under captions with subdivisions as follows:
A. Mental Deficiencies
B. Other diseases of the Psychobiologic Unit C. Mental Disorders
Psychoses
Psychoneuroses
Primary Behavior Disorders.
These diseases are classified in the "Fourth" edition under revised captions as follows:
A. Disorders caused by or associated with impairment of brain tissue function
1. Acute brain disorders 2. Chronic brain disorders
B. Mental deficiencies
C. Disorders of psychogenic origin or without clearly defined physical cause or structural change in the brain
1. Psychotic disorders
2. Psychophysiologic autonomic and visceral disorders 3. Psychoneurotic disorders
4. Personality disorders
5. Transient situational personality disorders.
Basic to the terminology is the word "disorder," which is used in its broadest sense to signify a group of related conditions affecting the psychobiologic unit. Each group of disorders consists of psychiatric syndromes or conditions referred to as "reactions." These "reactions" are all disturbances of mental functioning. Conditions which affect the brain and associated or related structures without major disturbances of mental functioning are classified in the Nomenclature of Disease in the section "Diseases of the Nervous System." When the two are associated, both should be diagnosed, coded and recorded.
Mental disorders with known etiologic factors are classified under the first caption "Disorders caused by or associated with impairment of brain tissue function." The brain tissue damage or the cause of it are provided for in the subdivision of the classification. These subdivisions follow the pattern of the etiologic categories. For example, "Delirium due to trauma" formerly classified and coded as 009-42x is now classified as 000-4 .. Acute brain syndrome associ- ated with trauma, specify trauma; "Delirium due to typhoid fever," old code number 009-lyO is now classified as 000-115 Acute brain syndrome due to systemic infection, typhoid fever.
￼106 MENTAL DISORDERS
The classification of Mental deficiency has been restricted to hereditary, or familial and idiopathic. Mental deficiency as a part of the clinical picture associ- ated with organic brain syndromes is compensated for by the use of the decimal digit combination x4.
Psychiatric disorders of psychogenic origin, or without brain tissue impairment are classified under the second caption. A change from previous editions is the expansion of the schizophrenic reactions and the reduction in the number of manic depressive reactions. The major change however, has been the inclusion of the classification of "Psychophysiologic autonomic and visceral disorders." These disorders formerly were classified under the various topographic disease sections of the nomenclature but have now been transferred to this section in recognition of the involvement of both psychic and somatic factors in these con- ditions. Some of the conditions transferred to this section are:

The "Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders" (American Psychiatric Association) explains in detail the definitions of the new terminology and gives by example the relationship between the old and the new terminology. The coder and classifier of diseases of the psychobiologic unit must become familiar with the definitions of the new terminology as expressed in the manual if classification and coding is to be accurate.
To simplify this task and as a guide, the old terminology as listed in previous editions of Standard is tabulated below with a cross reference to the new terminology as listed in the "Fourth" edition of Standard. The code numbers for the old terminology are included as well as the code numbers for the new terminology. (See tabulation following.)
In the maintenance of the disease classification index file it is suggested that new disease classification index cards be prepared at an appropriate time in con- formity with the new terminology and rubrics. It is not considered advisable to transfer the old terms with their rubrics to the new cards. The old cards should be balanced as of the date of installation of the new cards and maintained as an appendix or an addendum to the active disease classification index file until such time as there is no further reference to them. They should then be placed in the inactive disease classification index file.

￼George W. Albee (1921–2006)
￼￼￼George W. Albee, a past President of the American Psy- chological Association (APA) and lifelong advocate of the importance of social change to deal effectively with mental disorders, died in his home in Longboat Key, Florida, on July 8, 2006, after a short illness. Family members gathered at his home to be with him at his death.
His impact on psychology is reflected in the many awards he received in his lifetime, which included the APA Distinguished Professional Contribution Award in 1975, the American Psychological Foundation Gold Medal Award for Life Achievement in Psychology in the Public Interest in 1993, and the Lifetime Achievement Award in Applied Pre- ventive Psychology in 1997. He was a member of nine APA divisions and a fellow of four of them: Divisions 12 (Society of Clinical Psychology), 27 (Society for Community Research and Action: Division of Community Psychology), 35 (Society for the Psychology of Women), and 44 (Society for the Psychological Study of Lesbian, Gay, and Bisexual Issues). With his passing, psychology lost one of the staunchest ad- vocates of prevention as the most important approach to dealing with psychological ills. He was also a lifelong advo- cate for the disenfranchised.
George’s belief that most psychological distress was a result of adverse social conditions—such as poverty, racism, and sexism—and not biology, undergirded his tireless fight for a psychology of prevention. His students could quote in their sleep his mantra “No mass disorder afflicting humankind

Copyright 2007 by the American Psychological Association 0003-066X/07/$12.00 Vol. 62, No. 4, 317–318 DOI: 10.1037/0003-066X.62.4.317
has ever been brought under control by attempts at treating the individual,” and many took up his call and pursued careers in public health.
George was born on December 20, 1921, in St. Mary’s, Pennsylvania. After attending local schools, he graduated from Bethany College in West Virginia in 1943 and served three years in the Army Air Forces during World War II. He earned his master’s degree (1947) and doctoral degree (1949) from the University of Pittsburgh with a dissertation titled “The Relation of Certain Socio-Cultural Experiences to De- lusions in Schizophrenia.” He completed a predoctoral clinical internship through the Veterans Administration (VA) and was among the first wave of psychologists to receive training in VA hospitals. After graduation, he joined the research staff at the Western Psychiatric Institute in Pittsburgh. His early re- search investigated various aspects of schizophrenia and laid the groundwork for his belief in the social causes of mental illness.
He began his lifelong association with the APA in 1951 when he joined its staff as assistant executive secretary. At the time, the APA was housed in seven rooms of the old Amer- ican Association for the Advancement of Science building, and APA’s entire professional staff consisted of four people: Fillmore Sanford, Jane Hildreth, Margaret Harlow, and Albee. Among his responsibilities were public information, public relations, and placement. He started the APA Employment Bulletin to assist with the latter. He hired Michael Amrine, an experienced science writer, to run the press room at the 1952 annual convention. Amrine ended up staying at APA for 17 years, and he and Albee collaborated on numerous public information projects.
George received a Fulbright Fellowship that took him to Helsinki University in 1953. He returned the following year to join the faculty at Western Reserve University (later Case Western Reserve University) in Cleveland, Ohio. There he rose through the ranks to professor and chaired the psychology department three different times. In 1958, he was named the George Trumbull Ladd Distinguished Professor of Psychology.
While at Case Western Reserve, he collaborated with Ellen Lane and their students to publish a lengthy series of studies on the childhood intellectual development of adult schizophrenics. Later, he and Marguerite Dickey published the first study of human resources in the mental health pro- fessions. Following that work, George was appointed to head the Task Force on Manpower of President Eisenhower’s Joint Commission on Mental Health and Illness in 1958. The report of the work of that commission, which was published sepa- rately as “Mental Health Manpower Trends” in 1959, was considered by Nicholas Hobbs to be one of the three most influential publications of the decade. The work of the com- mission led to the Community Mental Health Act and the
￼317
development of modern community mental health centers. George was recalled to service by President Carter and served as coordinator of the Task Panel on Prevention of the Presi- dent’s Commission on Mental Health from 1977 to 1978.
As a result of his experience and research in mental health, George became convinced of two things: first, that mental health problems were not the same as medical problems and could not be addressed by the same methods, and second, that there would never be sufficient human resources to treat all the “cases” of mental illness. He believed strongly that preventing problems was more effective, efficient, and humane in the long run than attempting to treat them with inadequate resources. Eventually, his work as an advocate for prevention would have both a national and international influence.
George joined the faculty at the University of Vermont in 1971 and remained there until he retired in 1992. He established the Vermont Conferences on Primary Prevention at the University of Vermont, which held annual conferences for 17 years and published the proceedings, works that were seminal in promoting prevention programs around the world. Several of his students have become internationally recog- nized experts in prevention and mental health policy. George served as a mentor in prevention for his junior colleagues as well.
Trained at a time when psychology was seen as the step- child of psychiatry, George advocated for independent training centers for psychologists and for legal recognition of psycholo- gists. Never afraid of controversy, he published many articles demonstrating the inadequacy of the sickness model of psycho- pathology, noting instead the contribution of social and political factors to their development. He taught that poverty, racism, and sexism were far more strongly associated with mental illness than were microbes, genes, or twisted molecules. He was an advocate for social change and for strengthening individual resources for coping with adversity.
In line with these views, he even took on the psycholog- ical establishment and published articles recommending that psychotherapy not be paid for by medical insurance, correctly predicting that insurance companies would then begin to dic- tate how psychotherapy should be practiced. He was ada- mantly opposed to the current move to obtain prescription privileges for psychologists, a practice he saw as antithetical to a psychological practice and a boon to the pharmaceutical industry, which already dominates psychiatric practice.
When George retired from the University of Vermont, he moved to Longboat Key, Florida. He was appointed courtesy professor at the Florida Mental Health Institute and visiting professor at the University of South Florida, where he con- tinued advocating for prevention. Recently, the University of South Florida’s National Institute on Multicultural Compe- tence dedicated its Student Mentoring/Early Career Profes- sional Leadership Development Training Program to George with these words: “This new intervention is dedicated to the life and legacy of George Albee, whose advocacy for preven- tion in the fields of counseling and psychology underlies the principles and spirit of the Student Mentoring and Early Career Professional Leadership Development Training Pro- gram.”
George was an avid cook, gardener, and “rancher” (pigs, a cow, chickens), and he lived a green life long before doing so became part of a social movement. Early mornings in Vermont would see him making the rounds of the supermar- kets in his red pickup truck, collecting their discarded food for feeding to his pigs, or fertilizing his gigantic poppies with sawdust and animal droppings from the psychology depart- ment’s animal colony. His garden supported many tables each fall, and his contributions of tomatoes were legendary. He reached the national finals of a cooking contest with his recipe for “Marco Polo Pot Roast” and published a paper, jointly authored with his wife Margaret Tong, on Chinese cooking for Vermonters (titled “Woodstoves and Woks”).
As Steve Goldston, Justin Joffe, and I wrote in 1992, in a Festschrift for George to celebrate his 70th birthday,
[We] have also been invited along with George—to write articles and books, to plan conferences, to kill and dress chickens that were no longer layers, and in myriad other ways to walk with him in his path and to see the world through his lenses: a world free from exploitation and domination of one group by another, a world in which each person has the freedom and the resources to develop her or his resources to the fullest, a world in which the highest goal would be one person’s concern and regard for oth- ers. . . . [W]ith George’s invitation comes the unwritten command to fight the good fight, to smite the unrighteous, to educate the Philistines—with energy, commitment, and enthusiasm.
As far as a life so varied and energetic can be reduced to words, that chapter captures some of the main themes and contributions of George’s professional life and a little of what he was like—some of his humor, his humanity, his dedication to improving the lot of humankind, his intellec- tual energy, and his wide-ranging curiosity.
George was a frequent contributor to an eclectic array of publications: His letters to Ann Landers resulted in an article titled “Ann and Me,” and he also wrote a humor column for the Longboat Observer for several years. But most important, until the end, he wrote about, advocated, and truly battled for prevention. Albee’s memorial service at the University of Vermont on August 20, 2006, began with a five-minute slide show compiled by his daughter-in-law Beth Donovan. The photographs of George in those slides ranged across the years—from an image of him as a baby on his mother’s lap, through his time in uniform during World War II, then farm- ing his land, debating, cooking, milking a cow, receiving APA awards, to very recent portraits surrounded by his grandchil- dren—and were accompanied by a recording of Frank Sinatra singing “My Way,” written by Paul Anka. As we listened to Sinatra, some of us couldn’t help but think that the words might have been written for George himself:
I’ve lived, a life that’s full, I’ve traveled each and every highway. And more, much more than this,
I did it my way.
Albee is survived by his wife, Margaret Tong; his children, Luke Albee, Alec Albee, Marina Albee, and Sarah Albee Willson; and 10 grandchildren.

### Your Biography

Young neuroscientist from Cambridge. In 1971, you haven't even finished your dissertation, which proposes a model of the function of the brain with respect to vision. You come to the APA primarily because of your interest in the work of Miller and Chomsky. You think of the brain as essentially an information-processing device, and you know that Miller and Chomsky both got their start working in information theory during WWII.

You were born in Essex, England, and educated at the private, prestigeous Rugby School. You went to Trinity College, Cambridge on 1 October 1963, where you studied Mathematics for both a BS and an MS. You became interested neuroscience and started a PhD under the direction of Giles Brindley. You are currently working on your Dissertation in the physiology of vision. You've only published three papers at this point, but they have been influential.

You treat the brain as an information processing system. You put forth (in concert with Tomaso Poggio) the idea that one must understand information processing systems at three distinct, complementary levels of analysis. This idea is known in cognitive science as Marr's Tri-Level Hypothesis:

*	computational level: what does the system do (e.g.: what problems does it solve or overcome) and, equally importantly, why does it do these things

*	algorithmic/representational level: how does the system do what it does, specifically, what representations does it use and what processes does it employ to build and manipulate the representations

            <Text>## Thomas S. Szasz, MD

### Your Biography

You are Thomas S. Szasz, MD, Professor of Psychiatry at State University of New York at Syracuse.

In 1960, you published The Myth of Mental Illness (T. Szasz, 1960), which defends your view that “there is no such thing as ‘mental illness’” (p 1).  To you, psychiatry and psychology are the study of human behavior. Scientists who practice these fields engage in the most common of all human behaviors: they talk to people. Their regular use of terminology like ‘patient,’ ‘diagnosis’, and ‘treatment’ obscures this fact and makes us think psychiatrists are doing something other than simply communicating. Worse yet, the use of nouns like ‘libido’ and ‘psychic energy,’ implies objects that can be studied, and hence, when we use them, we think we’re talking about some actual thing rather than just a mere theoretical construct. All of this medicalizes normal human behavior, and makes normal human communication a ‘treatment.’  

Your views have not, shall we say, been received with open arms. In 1961, The Commissioner of the New York State Department of Mental Hygiene publicly demanded that you be fired from your tenured position, on the grounds that your views—as articulated in The Myth of Mental Illness—were inconsistent with your position as Professor of Psychiatry. These events added to your notoriety, making you widely known, but often misrepresented.

You are often accused of ‘not believing in mental illness.’ That isn’t quite right. The phrase ‘mental illness’ is, after all, a noun phrase. That means it denotes an entity or a state of being. You do not deny that there are people who behave in ways that are destructive to themselves and others; nor do you deny that talking to another person—especially one trained in communication—can be very helpful indeed. But you do deny that there is any thing called ‘mental illness.’ That is, you deny that the phrase ‘mental illness’ refers to an entity or a state of being. If it has any meaning at all, it refers to a set of actions or behaviors.

The Philosopher of Science Karl Popper heavily influences your reasoning for this position. Popper famously held that for an area of inquiry to be scientific, it had to make bold, surprising conjectures that were, in principle, falsifiable. This was the criterion of demarcation between scientific inquiry and 'pseudoscientific' inquiry: if a theory was able to explain away any possible phenomenon that might threaten that theory, that theory was thereby pseudoscientific, rather than scientific. To be scientific, a theory must make claims that  might be wrong. The more explicit a theory is in specifying the ways in which it might be wrong, the more that theory is scientific.
  One of Popper’s famous and controversial examples was Freudian psychoanalysis.  According to Popper, Freudianism had developed to such a point that any evidence presented against the theory would be incorporated into the theory by Freudians as evidence for ‘repression’ or ‘sublimation.’ Famously, he pointed out, Freud was never, himself, psychoanalyzed. When asked why, he would retort that he 'did it himself,' but that response was frequently rejected as illegitimate when produced by his patients.

But Popper went a step further. He also questioned the doctrine of ‘historicism’ that he saw underlying much of social and psychological “science” of the early 20th century (Popper, 1957). Popper believed that the founders of the ‘human sciences’ had become enamored with the progress made by the ‘natural sciences’ in the 18th and 19th centuries. This progress rested largely on the belief that for any given event in the physical world, one could fully explain that event by specifying the physical conditions of the world prior to that event. In short, that all physical events were physically determined by pre-existing states of affairs. Early psychologists and sociologists adopted this belief wholesale, and inappropriately assumed that in order to explain the actions of a person or a society, one only need to look at the pre-existing conditions, and wait for the laws of nature to take their course. The most obvious example of this reasoning is the work of Karl Marx, who held that socialist revolution was the inevitable arc of human development.  

The same kind of reasoning exists in Freudian and Jungian psychology. Each of them believes, largely as a hypothesis not a defended conjecture, that a true explanation for a person’s behavior is one that specifies the relevant events in that person’s childhood. This belief can be found in the earliest history of psychiatry and psychology (see the “Psychoanalysis” section of the gamebook).

You reject all of this.  To you, the human being cannot be explained in these historicist or deterministic ways. Communication between people is not determined by psychosocial antecedents.  It is free and voluntary.


Thus, to you, psychiatry should be based on the analysis of what you call ‘sign-behavior’: the manipulation and interpretation of symbols for the sake of communication by humans. Psychiatry constructed in this way, you argue, would less resemble medicine than it would other traditional disciplines focused on the understanding of symbols and their manipulation: philosophy, linguistics, semiotics, etc.  On the other hand, the brain is best understood using the terminology of biology and chemistry, and the new and improving field of neurology and neuroscience. Psychiatry as practiced today is trapped by its own nomenclature, which descends from the unfortunate identification with medicine and the idealization of historicist explanations.

Consider, for example, the following passage in the Myth of Mental Illness:

&gt; There is, as I noted before, a serious discrepancy between what psychotherapists and psychoanalysts do and what they say they do. What they do, quite simply, is to communicate with other persons (often called “patients”) by means of language,m nonverbal signs and rules; they analyze—that is, discuss, explain and speculate about—the communicative interactions which they observe and in which they themselves engage; and they often recommend engaging in the same types of conduct and avoiding others.  I believe that these phrases correctly describe the actual operations of psychoanalysts and psychosocially orientated psychiatrists. But what do these experts tell themselves and others concerning their work? They talk as if they were physicians, physiologists, biologists or even physicists. We hear about “sick patients” and “treatments,” “diagnoses” and “hospitals,” “instincts” and “endocrine functions,” and, of course, “libido” and “psychic energies,” both “free” and “bound.” All this is fakery and pretense whose purpose is to “medicalize” certain aspects of the study and control of human behavior. (p 4-5)

Another common theme in your work is the comparison between advocates of psychiatry and religious zealots. In the Myth of Mental Illness, you claimed:

&gt; While Freud criticized revealed religion for the patent infantilism that it is, he ignored the social characteristics of closed societies and the psychological characteristics of their loyal supporters. He thus failed to see the religious character of the movement he himself was creating. It is in this way that the paradox that is psychoanalysis—a system composed of a historicist theory and an antihistoricist therapy—come into being. (p 7)

In this case, Freud himself is at fault for failing to anticipate the fervor with which his followers would pursue his theory. It is the psychoanalysts of today who have turned psychiatry into an ideology.

Your most recent book, The Manufacture of Madness: A Comparative Study of the Inquisition and the Mental Health Movement, argues that society constantly worries about the unknown and threatening, whether those come from outside or inside the particular society. Throughout the ages, charlatans have offered society comfort and security in the form of witchcraft and religion. By classifying and controlling a perceived threat from the ‘mentally ill’, psychiatry has taken over this role as ‘protector’. And hence, is not significantly different than those who prosecuted the Spanish inquisition (T. S. Szasz, 1970).

### Victory Objectives

Take your role as gadfly seriously. Question everyone and everything. Object strongly to speakers to assert, without evidence, explanations that appeal to non-existent entities, or that classify actions (behaviors) as states of being.
The re-writing of the DSM is an important moment in the history of psychology. While you agree with many of the critiques of the DSM-II, you worry that those leading the charge for a new DSM have ulterior motives. The economics of medicine is increasingly dependent upon both medical insurance (a new entity in the American economy) and pharmaceuticals.  Both of these entities are highly regulated; and both insist on careful categorization and 'scientific reliability' before paying for treatments.  You suspect that some of the individuals (including Robert Spitzer) involved in the rewriting of the DSM are motivated not by a dissatisfaction with the scientific validity of existing categories like you, but rather to create a diagnostic manual that will meet the requirements of the insurance and pharmaceutical companies. A DSM that results from these pressures, and not intellectual virtues, will reflect more the demands of economic policy than concern for patients well-being.

At the same time, you want to promote your theory of psychiatry as analysis of sign-behavior as a relevant alternative to psychoanalysis. To that end, you strongly support anything that characterizes psychology as talk-therapy, but reject any attempt to replace talk therapy with psychoactive drugs.

When, and if, the game reaches a point of attempting to define mental illness, you need to propose, and work to pass, an official statement from the APA that states:

	&gt; There is no 'thing' called 'mental illness,' only  sets of behaviors that may be destructive to an individual and his or her society.

#### Game Strategy

Your notoriety is a double-edged sword. Yes, people listen when you talk. But most people at the APA publicly disagree with everything you say. That does not mean that they don't privately agree.

You are, in many respects, like the Socratic gadfly. You question the hidden assumptions upon which the entire industry of psychiatry and psychology is built. So while some may privately agree with your arguments, they suspect that your position would undermine their livelihoods, and hence will do nothing to support you in public.

It is important then not to make grand public pronouncements that will alienate your colleagues. The fact is that you believe that psychiatry, correctly constructed, does have an important role to play in contemporary society. You are thrilled that the APA has decided to drop the DSM II. But you are deeply concerned about what will replace it. You need to find ways to work with your colleagues to ensure that the new version of the DSM avoids hollow, meaningless terminology ‘libido’, avoids pseudoscientific (i.e. not falsifiable) claims, and remains cognizant of the dangers of medicalizing normality.

### Specific Assignments

Present a version of your argument in Myth of Mental Illness in 1971. This is already on the schedule, so you should get working now.

Propose either a paper in which you critique the medical model used by psychiatry, or collaborate with G. Albee on a symposium on the medical model. This would be best presented in 1972, before the DSM-III is in the works.

Oppose the proposal to create a special committee on the psychology of women and the committee on women in psychology, NOT because you are sexist, but for three reasons (1) it isn't clearly distinguished from other areas of psychology, such as 'social psychology', (2) the name itself is separatist and exclusionary and (3) the organization seems to be a pressure group affiliated with feminist political causes. (the last of these can be tied to the Leona Tyler principle).  GAME NOTE: There is no evidence that the real Szasz actually put forward any arguments like these, or that he is against the women's movement. Quite the contrary: he has long been a supporter of the empowerment of women. But it is consistent with his outspoken libertarianism and his views on science to avoid the rigidification of terms (such as 'woman') when they are put into policy. Thus, you must NOT articulate an argument against women's empowerment, but rather about the ways in which codifying a classification in the official language tends to exclude and reify the identity of a group of people, which then excludes others and leads to self-limitations.

Warning: Your arguments against psychiatry are almost entirely against psychoanalysts.  You argue that ‘mental illness’ cannot be a disease because it has no basis in physiology. But the growing success of psychopharmacology threatens to derail your argument. In short: you hold that if it is a disease, it must have a physiological explanation. But here’s where you might have a problem: if neuroscience and/or psychopharmacology were capable of providing a coherent explanation of schizophrenia, for example, would you allow schizophrenia as a genuine mental illness? Or would still hold that ‘mental illness’ is only a metaphor for human behavior?

            <Comments>The careful reader will notice that your critiques here parallel the 'idols' outlined by Francis Bacon in his classic Novum Organon. See the discussion of Bacon in the 'History of the Definition of Mental Illness' in the gamebook.
Actually, this is historically inaccurate. Popper did, in fact, use Freud and Adler, along with Marx, as his primary examples of pseudoscientific research in Conjectures and Refutations (1962), which was published after Szasz' The Myth of Mental Illness. Popper's work before 1960 includes his The Logic of Scientific Discovery (1959), which lays out the theory of falsifiability as demarcation criterion, but does not illustrate it with Freudianism. In the same way, his 1945 The Open Society and Its Enemies—which Szasz cites as influential—contains a few off-hand comparisons between Freud and Marx, but does not articulate the connection in a systematic way.
The historian of ideas may notice that this view is Kantian in nature: human language, which is the essential, identifying ability of humanity, is itself uncaused and spontaneous.</Comments>

            <Text>## George Miller, PhD
### Your Biography

You are George Miller, PhD, Professor of Psychology at MIT, founder of cognitive psychology and (with Noam Chomsky (MIT-Linguistics), Herbert Simon and Newell (Carnegie Mellon –Computer Science)) cognitive science.

You were born in 1920 in Charleston, West Virginia, where you lived until you enrolled in George Washington University in 1937. You transferred to the University of Alabama in 1938, where you completed your BA and were appointed Instructor of Psychology in 1941. You started Graduate school at Harvard in 1943.

While at Harvard, you joined the Psycho-Acoustical Laboratory where you worked on speech communication over static on radios.  At that time you met and befriended a brilliant young linguist named Noam Chomsky.

You were elected to the position of Vice President of the APA in 1970, and take the role of President for the meeting of the APA in 1971, the first year of game play. You were 50 at the time of your election, which is young by professional standards.

You made your research ‘name’ with your famous paper “The magic number seven plus or minus two” (Miller, 1956). It is a must-read for all psychologists today. In 1960, you published Plans and the structure of behavior, which sets out your vision of psychology as a cognitive science (Miller, 1960). In fact, you founded the Center for Cognitive Studies at Harvard in 1960.

You are also a student of the history of Psychology. In 1958, you were approached by the historian of Psychology E.G. Boring, whose tomes *A History of Experimental Psychology* and *Sensation and Perception in the History of Experimental Psychology* adorn the desks of many psychologists and philosophers. You were brought to the project by Boring himself, who had been scheduled to produce an update to his histories, but was unable to do so. At the time, you had been planning a new set of introductory psych courses at Harvard at the time, so you thought that this might be an opportunity for sympathetic research.

You took a leave of absence for the academic year 1958-1959 and spent the time at the Center for Advanced Study in Behavioral Sciences at Stanford. When you returned to Harvard, you worked with your colleague Jerome S. Bruner to create an introductory course titled “Psychological Conceptions of Man.” By 1961, you had finished the book which was published as Psychology: The Science of Mentality (Miller, 1962).

### Game Objectives

Promote your vision of cognitive psychology as an alternative to behaviorism. You should actively work to funnel funding to projects that attempt to make inferences about underlying mental mechanisms, and away from those that deny the existence of such mechanisms (i.e. radical behaviorists).

As a student of the history of psychology, you are also very keen to place yourself in the narrative arc of psychology –which means that you will keep a close eye on those who are characterizing historical figures in inaccurate ways, or ignoring historical achievements that are often forgotten. Both the behaviorists and the psychoanalysts have a tendency to dismiss aspects of the history of psychology as 'non-scientific.' You are not so sure.

There is much in the work done by early experimentalists like William James that anticipates your work. And while you're wary of being labeled an 'introspectivist' and dismissed as a neo-Wundtian, it is important to point out that cognitivism has historical antecedents, and it may be behaviorism that is the historical anomaly. Watson and Pavlov are clearly important psychologists, but the history of psychology has not always been behavioristic, and you are keen to ensure that it is not portrayed as such.

You are neutral on **the issue of the definition of mental illness**, but be ready to oppose any definition that is clearly behaviorist or psychoanalytic in nature.
### Game Strategy

Your position as first president gives you great power, but also great responsibility. Your first speech sets the tone of the entire game, not just the first session. So while there will be a great temptation to spend your time beating up behaviorism and promoting cognitivism, you should work hard to reconcile the warring factions.  You are the first president from the cognitivist side – the behaviorists are worried that your election signifies a massive shift in the kind of research that will be valued and funded.  You need to allay those worries, and work for understanding of the mind, not petty disciplinary politics.

Much can be done towards this end by maintaining a good, highly visible working relationship with your elected successor Anthony Bandura.  Remember that like him, you were ‘raised’ a behaviorist. The people in that faction are your friends and colleagues. What’s more, some commentators have pointed out that Bandura’s theory of ‘social learning’ in the bobo doll experiment can be interpreted to support a cognitivist position, rather than a behaviorist one. If you changed your mind, perhaps Bandura can as well? The same holds for Evelyn Hooker, who was schooled in the 'Tolman' tradition of behaviorism.

### Specific Assignments

You chair the Board of Directors during the first APA.

You will open the game with a presidential address based on George Miller's actual speech “Psychology as a means of promoting human welfare.”

Look up Miller’s actual presidential speech (Miller, 1969). You’ll notice that it is actually not about the conflict between behaviorism and cognitivism. It is about what the psychological community can agree upon, not about what you disagree. Take a cue from the actual history here, and follow in his lead.

In the first week, the gamemaster will introduce a 'mental rotation' experiment based in Shepard &amp; Metzler 1971. You should be prepared to present the data – if your class is using the online psychology laboratory, report your classes' data. If not, report the data from the original.

Advocate for the role of psychology in social issues, supporting both Chomsky and others in their efforts.

When Bieber and Socarides submit their report on sexual deviation in 1972, you should reject it as assuming too strict a Freudian perspective.

**Fission**: Found the Cognitive Science Society with Noam Chomsky and David Marr (if he is a character).

### Your Biography

You are Robert Hopcke. Your character is actually a bit of a historical anachronism.  

The other characters in this game are were actually around in the early 1970s, typically in their 40's and 50's at the time. You were not. In fact, your first book doesn't appear until 1989. That means that today, in 2011, you are active in psychoanalytic circles.  Your autobiography is available online at http://www.robhopcke.com/MyProfessionalExperience.en.html. I'll quote the summary here:

&gt;I have two degrees in counseling: a Master of Arts in Theology, with a Pastoral Counseling emphasis, from Pacific Lutheran Theological Seminary, which is the degree under which I received my Marriage and Family Therapist license in 1986, and a second Master of Arts in Clinical Counseling from California State University, Hayward (now Cal State East Bay). My background encompasses a number of different models and approaches.  I am most known for being a Jungian-oriented therapist but also important to my professional identity has been formal training in pastoral counseling and spiritual direction, long-term object-relations psychodynamic treatment, cognitive-behavioral approaches to depression, health and sexuality concerns, and many years of being an "out" gay male therapist and activist in the Bay Area GLBT community. I am a best-selling author, public speaker, teacher, supervisor and professional consultant.

We've included you in the game to voice a gay-positive Jungian perspective. Jung, himself,  was not very gay-friendly. And those who follow his theory strictly continued that tradition throughout the 1970s.  Thus, in order to find a gay-positive Jungian, we have to break the historical accuracy of the game. As a matter of actual history, you didn't publish this perspective on Jungian psychology until the late 1980s, but that is not important here.

### Game Objectives

Working with your fellow psychiatrists (MD's), create a proposal to limit the treatment of the mentally ill to medical doctors.  This should be presented in 1972. Expect a furious response from Albee, and maybe even Szasz. You may choose to work out a compromise with Albee via E. Hooker, who, like you, has multiple degrees.

Your role in this game is to represent the aspect of the Jungian psychoanalytic tradition that was friendly to homosexuals. Jung himself was not.  Your primary work has been to reformulate a version of Jungian theory that is consistent with the new taxonomy of sexuality in the DSM. You should present that vision as a paper in 1975.

You should oppose any attempt to remove psychoanalytic language or categories from the DSM. At the same time, you should make sure that the Jungian perspective is protected in the manual.

*When, and if, the game reaches a point of trying to define mental illness*, you must pass a psychoanalytic interpretation of mental disorder / illness.

*Fission*: Split to the ApsaA

Onl.y in the consultation roorn does the horlosexual reveal hinrself nnd his world. No other data. statistics. or statenrents can be' itccepted as setting lbrth the true nature of ho- nrosexuality. All othel sources may be heavily weighted by face-saving devices or rationalizations or, if they issue from lay bodies, Iack the scien- tific and medical background to
support their views- The best that can be said for the well-intentioned but unqualified observel is that he is misguided because he does not have and can not appl.y those iech- niques which would make it possible to discern the deep underlying clin- ical disorder or to evaluate the emo- tional patterns and interpelsonal events in the life of a homosexual.
T'here are many doctors who. by ignoring and disregarding hornosex- uality. hope to render it invisible and nonexistent. To acknowledge it would be tantamount, they fear, to permitting it.

Homosexuality-Socandes 1199
￼a conservative estimate is that be tween 2,500,000 and 4,000,000 adult American males sufier from this con- dition. By way of comparison, a Public Health Service report esti- mates the four major illnesses in this country (1963 to 1965) as: heart disease, 3,619,000; arthritis and rheumatism, 3,481,00O; impairment (except paralysis) of the back and spine, 1,769,000; mental and nervous disease, 1,767,000.u
The female homosexual finds her- self in a paradoxical situation. Al- though suffering in essence with the same disorder as her male counter- part, little concern has been manifest by either the medical or legal pro- fessions about her condition. She too, however, needs special medical, legal, and sociological consideration.
Many writers prefer to use the term "lesbianism" to describe the clinical condition of female homo- sexuality. This reflects an attempt to romanticize and minimize it. Ho- mosexual relations between women are often considered superficial and some sources do not regard female homosexual contacts as sexual at all despite intense orgastic experiences between the women involved. Never- theless, their plight is as grave if not more so than that of the male homo- sexuals. For example, the loss of a homosexual partner can lead the bereft female homosexual to severe depressions and suicide with greater frequency than in the male.
I have dealt intensively with the illnesses diagnosed as perversions,'' '5 especially with homosexuality, fol the past 15 years-both in clinical practice and in teaching. Our first step is to ask ourselves "What is a homosexual?" fn essence, a homo- sexual is a person who consistently and from inner necessity engages in homosexual acts. This pattern arises from faulty sexual identity, a prod- uct of the earliest years of life. Typ- ically, we find a pathological family constellation in which there is a domineering, crushing mother who will not allow the developing child to
achieve autonomy from her and an absent, weak, or rejecting father.
There are two categories of home' sexuality: obligatory (true) homo- sexuality and episodic homosexual behavior. The latter is characterized by isolated homosexual acts without the stereotypy, the corhpulsivity, of the former and is due to the con- scious desire for variational experi- ence, the achievement of "sPecial gains," such as power and Prestige, or the quest for unusual sensations. Such transient behavior may occur in specific situations as well; it may be rampant in prisons, remote set- tlements, or during other tYPes of confinement where persons of the opposite sex are not available. Ex- cept for those already predisposed to homosexuality through early psy- chological trauma, the individual reverts to heterosexual behavior when members of the oPPosite sex are again available. Current research points to the fact that a person does not become a true obligatorY homo- sexual if the initial design is not laid out by 3 years of age, that is, during the preoedipal period of develoP- ment.
There is a high incidence of Para- noia or paranoid-like symptomato- logy in overt homosexuals. This is related to the medical fact that overt obligatory homosexuality is either a fixation or regression to the earliest stages of ego development. As a re- sult, archaic and primitive mental mechanisms belonging to the earliest stages of life characterize the homo- sexual's behavior. Also, homosexual- ity, obligatory or not, can be seen in the schizophrenic in his frantic at- tempt to establish some vestige of object relations as an expression of the fragmented and disorganized psychic apparatus with which he has to struggle.
It is misleading to classifY homo- sexuality as a sociopathic disorder. Not all homosexuals or perhaps even a majority display the "absence of conscience" mechanism so charac- teristic of the so-called psychopath.
The compulsivity of the sexual pression, its insistence for despite all dangers to the
and all risks, gives the
that one does not care about lished social institutions or oneself. The annals of political tory include personalities at very highest levels, men with exceptionally well-developed

2. Homosexual obiect choice is .not innate or instinctual nor is hetcr- cexual object choice since botlr are learned behavior. The choice of sex- rul object is not predetermined by
chromosomal tagging. Heter&lt;lsexual object choice is determined from birth due to cultural and environ- mental indoctrination. It is support- .ed by universal human concepts of lnating and the family unit with the omplementariness and contrast be-
the two sexes- It is further determined bv zVz billion years of
evolution and is a producl of sexual differentiation, at first y based on reproduction but widened to include sexual ification, eg, from one-celled
al fission the development of two-celled sexual reproduction to
rate entire organ differentiation finally to the development of rate individuals reciprocally
to each other anatomically. nologically, psychologically,
in many other ways.
Only massive childhood fears can
ge and disrupt the standard female pattern. Such early un- ious feals are responsible for
later development of homosex- ty.
3. Homosexual behavior which is igatory ( episodic t is prac- by individuals through choice a variety of motivations and ld not be confused with true
xuality. These motivations as complex as any other moti- which may influence humnn ior: personal gain. power, Farch for a variational experience (an extra sexual "thrill" r, pr.eferred and position, etc. This form not caused by unconscious fears ensuing guilt but is due to con- deliberate choice. One must ull.y differentiate between the tory and the nonobligatoly as latter type would like to mask
behind true honrosexuality in order to save plidc and iustify its occur- rence.
4. Since thc obligator.v lromosex- ual is suflering fronr an illness it is obvious that hc should not be lren- alized fol tlre consequent activities carried out in private, not oflensive to public decency, and in Jlartner- ship with a consenting adult. He should not be made to suffer special penalties because of the manifesta- tion of his illness so long as it is not
ac&lt;omp:rnied b-y antisrrcial or crim- inal behavior.
The view that obligatory homo- sexuality per se is punishable by law and thc view that it is, in fact, a medical problern are antithetical and this matter requires revision. How- ever. any change in the legal code should be accompanied by a clear- cut statement as to the nature of obligatory homosexualit.y, its diag- nosis as a form of mental illness, and a universal declaration of support
for its treatment by qualified medical practitioners.
The Wolfenden report'' succeed- ed in having legislation passed in England redressing the inequities Iaced by the homosexual but it re- grettably failed both the homosexual and the public by not making it ex- plicit that homosexuality is an emo- tional illness and, therefore, lies within the province of medicine. One might have recommended this addition to the Wolfenden report:
Homosexurtlitv is a form of e'motional disorder q'hit'h mav cause such grave clisruptiori to the equililrrium of thc in- dividual that all meaningful rt'lation- .ships in life are damaged from the outsel anrl peculiarly susceptible to breakdou'n :lnd destruction. Furlher. attitudes tou':rrd the olrllosite s€x ar€ so fille&lt;l q'ith dislrust, abhorrence, hate. anrl revulsion as tcl render thcnr imp&lt;lssiblc of anv relationshilr except on the' mo.st superficial and briltle basis, if then. The.sc characteristi&lt;'s are an outcome of childhood fears u'hich r.ripl&gt;lr, the individual in his total ad:rptation.
All nrale homosexuals suffer, para- doxically, fronr the yearning to be a
mart, not a woman ils conlmonly as- sumeal. They ho1;c to :rchieve a "shot" of nrasculinity in the homo- sexual act. Ostensitrly they ma.\'l)e- have in an alTcctionitte and kindly way towtird the sexuirl parttter bttt this is a veneer, a rationillization, to cover the life-saving, ego-saving o1t- er{rtion of obligatory homosuxualitv. The homosexuill must carry out his act; unless he does he will sufler in- tolerable anxiety and experience massive threat to his psychic organ-
ization nnd functioning. Like the addict, he must have his "fix."
In the light of clinical research the honrosexual symptom can be seen as an intricately designed de- fense whose purpose is to maintain the equilibrium of a severely disturb- ed individual. Tampering with his psyche by unqualificd persons is to be condemned as he may become seriously disorganized if a prema- turc attempt is made to interrupt his homosexual activities. Conversely, an individual, however impelled to- ward them, who has refrained from homosexual activities may be tragi- cally pushed into them by unwise guidance.
5. There is no obligatory homo- sexual who can be considered to be health.y. The very existence of this condition precludes it. Despite the appearance at any given time of adequate life performance, there is always extreme conflict present which threatens to disrupt this frag- ile adiustment.
6. As oblig:rtory homosexuality carl not be considered to be a legal isstre, so it can not be viewed as a problem of morality. As with psy- chosis and neurosis, it can not be regarded as n consequence of im- molality ol a manifestation of evil spilits occupying the body for which special tortures were devised and special legal punishment was ex- acted.
These misconceptions must be corrected. It would, however, be the utmost folly to remed.Y then.r and then disrniss or overlook the deeP

￼psychological disturbance which is the basis of the homosexual condi- tion. Some well-intentioned groups would have us not only do away with legal and moral issues but have us announce that homosexuals are not ill at all. They point to disturbances among heterosexuals and attempt to make a comparison. While the ex- istence of psychosis and neurosis are, of course, found in heterosexual- ity, the heterosexual orientation is not, of itself, an indication of path- ological condition while homosex- uality always is. The inability to function heterosexually and the ex- treme hostility toward the opposite sex originating in the fear of one's impulses toward the mother has led to a wholesale flight from the female forever and to a compromise adapta- tion of choosing a male for sexual gratification and to save the self from intolerable anxiety.
We practice today in the atmos- phere of a sweeping sexual revolu- tion. Together with the mainstream heterosexual revolt has come the an- nouncement that a homosexual rev- olution is also in progress and that homosexuality should be granted total acceptance as a valid form of sexual functioning, different from but equal to heterosexuality. Such acceptance of homosexuality, as being a simple variation of normal- ity, is naive, not to say grounded in ignorance. Equally misleading is the idea that it is merely an asPect of normal development, a transient stage of adolescence, without mean- ingful sequallae. That we, as phy- sicians, could be persuaded to overlook such tcnden&lt;'ies among our young people is a harmful fantasy as shown by the fact that colleges can be pressured to charter homo- sexual groups on campus with all the privileges of other scholastic alrd social organizations, thereby lending tacit approval.
The implications of such trends are profound. I'or the adolescent, they make him uncertilin and con- fused. Even for an adult, struggling
to strengthen what may be a frail heterosexual- organization, the vi- cissitudes of maintaining sexual adequacy may drive him into a self- despising homosexual pattern. He does not know how else to resolve the deep conflicts which have per- sisted and tortured him since early childhood. Homosexuality is a fore- doomed attempt to find a panacea for the tormenting fear which origi- nated in early childhood and like any unrealistic solution remains un- satisfactory at all times and disas- trous much of the time.
It is vitally important to realize this fundamental point: the diag- nosis of homosexuality can not be self-made, imposed by jurists, ar- ticulated by clergy, or speculated about by social scientists. True ob- ligatory homosexuality is a complex condition and has to be difrerenti- ated from episodic homosexual be- havior entered into for a variety of conscious motivations as stated.
If the homosexual is to be granted his human right as a medical pa- tient, issues which becloud his status should be clarified. Above all, the homosexual must be recognized as an individual who presents a med- ical problem.
The whole issue of homosexuality must be transformed into one more scientific challenge to medicine which has time and again been :rble to alleviate the plaguing illnesses of man. With this respected leadership on the part of the physician, we will see a surge of support for the study and treatment of the disorder by all the techniques and knowledge nvail- able through the great resources and medical talent of the United States.

### Your Biography

#### Charles Socarides' Biography

When you were 13, you read a biography of Sigmund Freud and immediately decided to become a psychoanalyst. You were trained in Psychoanalytic Medicine Columbia University Center for Psychoanalytic Training and Research, graduating in 1952.

You have been practicing psychoanalysis in New York City since 1954, focusing on the treatment of homosexuality. You report that 'about a third' of your patients became heterosexual after psychoanalytic treatment. Following Freud, you believe that homosexuality is a neurotic adaptation to unresolved conflict, usually originating in the Oedipal stage of development.  You do not argue that homosexuality is immoral in the sense of 'against god's will' or anything like that, you simply believe that it is a maladaptation to normal development. You actually see yourself as an advocate for homosexuals, for you do not believe homosexuality is criminal or immoral, you believe it an illness like any other.

According to a 1995 interview in the NY Times “Socarides offered the closest thing to hope that many gay people had in the 1960s: the prospect of a cure. Rather than brand them as immoral or regard them as criminal, Socarides told gay people that they suffered from an illness whose effects could be reversed.”

#### Irving Bieber's Biography

You were born in New York City in 1909. You graduated from New York University Medical College in 1930, but went on to work at Yale Medical College, New York University, and starting in 1953 at the New York Medical College, where you taught a course in psychoanalysis.  Your 1962 book Homosexuality: A Psychoanalytic Study of Male Homosexuals is, in many ways, a response to the Kinsey Report. It reports on you study of 106 male homosexuals and 100 male heterosexuals seeking psychoanalysis for various problems.

In 1970, you attended a meeting of the American Psychiatric Association in San Francisco that was disrupted by gay activists, one of whom called you a "motherfucker." According to Charles Socarides, you took this very hard after having "been working all these years to help these people." In 1973, you told an interviewer that "a homosexual is a person whose heterosexual function is crippled, like the legs of a polio victim." You believed that, "although this change may be more easily accomplished by some than by others, in our judgment a heterosexual shift is a possibility for all homosexuals who are strongly motivated to change.”

### Your View

You are a Freudian, through and through. But more than that, you are a leader in the psychoanalytic treatment of homosexuality.  Your theory, that male homosexuality resulted from suppressed feelings of rejection caused by a cold, distant father and a misidentification of gender identity because of an overbearing mother, is orthodoxy.  Not only has it become  the popular notion of homosexuality in the public discourse, but it informs dominate treatment paradigm in the psychoanalytic community.

It is not, however, Freud's view.  Your theory is 'Freudian,' not Freud.  And it is worth pointing out that the theoretical explanation and treatment paradigms for homosexuality are different in England and Europe.

Freud mentions homosexuality a number of places in Introductory Lectures on Psychoanalysis, and it is crucially important that you study these carefully.  Freud believes that sexual life of children, which is regarded at the time as 'normal' includes a number of activities that would later in life be viewed as 'perverse', including same-sex contact.  In Freud's theory, heterosexuality develops with puberty in normal people. In 'inverts' or homosexuals, something goes wrong in this development. The object of ones' 'natural' desire--the genitals of the opposite sex—becomes transformed into parts of the body that represent those parts in the same sex.  Thus, homosexuality is no different in psychological mechanism than a foot fetish or any other neurotic 'perversion' (see p. 376-384 of Introductory Lectures) Homosexuality is not a psychologically isolated condition. According to Freud:

&gt; “We are compelled, however, to regard the choice of an object of one's own sex as a divergence in erotic life which is of positively habitual occurrence, and we are learning more and more to ascribe an especially high importance to it.” (p. 381)

In short, homosexuality is a kind of neurosis, yet it is not, itself, particularly worrying. The action itself is merely 'habitual,' and hence can be cured through standard habit-blocking therapy (Freud suggests that paranoia stops homosexuality on p. 381 of the Introductory Lectures).  It is, however, invariably an indicator of deeper psychological problems, as the transference and substitution of the 'natural' object of sexual desire to a different object will cause neurosis. See Ch 26 of the Introductory Lectures, especially p. 530, for Freud's explanation of homosexuality as neurotic narcissism.

For you, Bieber and Socarides, this theory is transformed somewhat.  You argue, in your 1962 study Homosexuality, that the normal course of development of puberty includes the identification of genders with innate 'active or passive tendencies' (p 4), and then self-identification with one of those tendencies. If a child has an innate tendency towards activity or passivity out of line with his or her gender, he or she is more likely to develop 'homosexual habits'.

At the same time, if an adolescent develops a pathological fear of heterosexual contact—specifically a fear of the gentiles of the opposite sex—that subconscious fear will motivate the ego to transform the object of sexual desire into something that is familiar: a part of the adolescent's own body. These fear are usually the result of some disturbed parent-child relationship. Just as the Oedipal phase is a normal part of development, fear of the opposite sex is a normal part of development. Heterosexuals are those for whom those fears resolve through maturation.

Homosexuals are, then, those who never fully mature in their sexuality, getting stuck at a stage where children are fearful of the other and fascinated with their own bodies. They pathologically project that self-love onto members of their own gender, instead of resolving their fears through heterosexual exploration.

You characterize Freud's theory of the development of homosexuality in three steps:

1.	The autoerotic phase partially persists and object cathexis is partially accomplished, but on a narcissistic level.

2.	Mental attitudes that exist during the phallic stage remain into adulthood.

3.	There are difficulties associated with the Oedipus phase.

It is worth noting that Bieber's analysis was only of male homosexuality.  Freud wrote one study of Lesbianism, which is included in the appendix of the game book.

Regardless of the particulars of your or Freud's view, you are absolutely committed to the thesis that

&gt; “All psychoanalytic theories assume that adult homosexuality is psychopathologic and assign differing weights to constitutional and experiential determinants. All agree that experiential determinants are in the main rooted in childhood and are primarily related to the family. Theories which do not assume psychopathology hold homosexuality to be one type of expression of a polymorphous sexuality which appears pathologic only in cultures holding it to be so.” (p 18)

### Game Objectives

Complicating matters somewhat, you (Bieber) were once classmates with Judd Marmor!  You were friends then, and that personal relationship may be at stake in this debate.

During your presentations, you must be able to both articulate the current psychoanalytic understanding of homosexuality and its connection to Freud's theory as presented in Introductory Lectures on Psychoanalysis.  You should also be ready to present any evidence that you may have that this theory is accurate.  You'll find that evidence in Ch 2 Bieber's 1962 book, listed under 'Must Read' below.   The first chapter contains Biebers' critiques of the Kinsey study (p. 16), Hooker's study (p. 17),  as well as the movement to declassify homosexuality as a mental illness in the UK (p. 15).

Your theory is summarized in Ch 9 of your 1962 book:

&gt; We consider Homosexuality to be pathologic bio-social, psychosexual adaptation to pervasive fears surrounding the expression of heterosexual impulses. In our view, every homosexual is, in reality, a “latent” heterosexual; hence we expected to find evidences of heterosexual strivings among the H-patients in our study.  (p. 220)

As a student, we leave it to you to decide if the evidence presented therein is sufficient motivation for the theoretical mechanism you are proposing.

 As the character, you have to make the best case you can for your position – the audience will determine if the evidence you present motivates the mechanism you defend. You have few, if any, friends in this effort.  We're sorry about that, but it is historically accurate. Marmor and Spiegel have  begun to be successful in separating psychoanalysis from your views on homosexuality. Your job in this game, then, is to advocate for a position that is almost certainly going to lose.  

While you need to make your case, you might want to put most of your energy focusing on something you can win: continuing the dominance of psychoanalysis in psychiatry and allowing treatment for individuals who see therapy for homosexuality voluntarily. The DSM often determines which conditions a therapist can treat in a clinical setting, or get funding to study scientifically. If 'homosexuality' is removed entirely, no one in psychiatry will be allowed to help individuals seeking treatment, or conduct scientific research into homosexuality. Those consequences are things you cannot live with.  

Look back at the definition of 'psychic illness' presented by Freud in Introductory Lectures (p. 445, but quoted in the gamebook 'History of Mental Illness: Freud' section.  For Freud (and Freudians), a psychic illness is something detrimental to one's life as a whole, something that the patient complains about, or that brings the patient displeasure.  Removing homosexuality from the list of mental illness will likely not change these facts for your patients, but you will no longer be allowed to treat them—and that seems to go against your oath as a medical doctor.

If the proposal from Marmor comes to the floor in 1971, present a proposal to stall the vote until after a taskforce conducts a literature review on the efficacy of treatment for homosexuality. You will request total control of that task force, including appointing its members. If you are successful, you will appoint yourself and yourself (Socarides and Bieber).  

You report should present aversion therapy as an effective method for stopping homosexual behavior. This is something of a anachronism for the sake of the game, as Socarides and Bieber were psychoanalysts.  But it's use was widespread in the treatment of homosexuality at the time, and you are the most famous defender of the medicalization of homosexuality.

If you are unsuccessful in getting the taskforce, you can join with Albee in his call for an ad hoc committee to be formed to study the history of the homosexuality in psychology and psychiatry. You're goal here is to make it acceptable to continue to treat homosexuals if they request it, even if it homosexuality itself was not considered a mental illness.

If it looks like the vote to remove homosexuality will pass in 1973 (and it almost certainly will), start collecting 'signatures' on a petition calling for the abdication of that vote, on the grounds that the decision was political (i.e. the board caved to the demands of the activists) and not scientific. If you can get 10% of the class to sign, you *may* be able to force a postponement or revote.

If the 'Leona Tyler' principle passes in 1973, banning the APA from making taking public positions on things not motivated by evidence, reintroduce your proposals, arguing that the removal of homosexuality was on the basis of politics, not science. If none of this works and 'homosexuality' is removed, and research and treatment of homosexuality is banned by the APA,  quit (in 1975) and found your own private organization called 'NARTH': North American association for Research and Therapy on Homosexuality (as a student, look it up).

Finally, *when and if the game gets to a point where the APA attempts to create a definition of ‘mental illness’*, work to get a psychoanalytic version passed.  You must also advocate for a theory of mental illness that takes into account the 'natural function' of a body.  Recall Freud's criteria for neurosis: if an individual's psychology is out of step with their biology, it will cause that individual to always be unfulfilled, and hence, will be detrimental to their overall outlook.  A healthy person is one who recognizes his or her own physical function and seeks a life in accordance with those functions.

#### Specific Assignments

Propose a taskforce to study sexual deviation in 1971, which will report back to the membership in 1973. Your report should summarize and present your Freudian view carefully.

R. Green and J. Spiegel will likely propose a taskforce on the history of homosexuality in psychiatry and psychology that will report in 1972. You should be ready to give an 'official' response to this report.  Marmor probably will as well, so be prepared for a  head-to-head debate in public.

*SECRET*: you are bound by patient-client confidentiality.  Your patients are not.  This is particularly difficult because many of the street activists who are disrupting meetings are your former patients. No one (other than them) can know that. By your best estimates, your therapy is effective only about 1/3 of the time. Many of your patients are brought to you by their parents. In a classic transference reaction, their anger against their parents is transferred to you, and drives them to classic father-rebellion activities after therapy ends.  

One in particular: Ron Gold, has you concerned. Ron is now a journalist for Variety, and you saw him at the incident in New York arguing with Robert Spitzer. Ron Gold may not be a character, depending on the size of the class.

*DSM III*: Vehemently oppose any attempt to remove psychoanalytic language from the DSM.

LGBTs Upset With
Obama
BY BOB ROEHR
Sen. Barack Obama’s presidential campaign has stirred great discontent within the LGBT com- munity by giving a forum to an award-winning gospel singer and minister known for his antigay rhetoric. The series of gaffes has continued to echo within that community, though the main- stream press has been slow to report or under- stand its signi cance.
The growing  restorm kicked off Oct. 20 when Earl Ofari Hutchinson wrote online in The Huf ngton Post, “Barack Obama ripped a page straight from the Bush campaign playbook with his announced upcoming three date barnstorm tour through South Carolina with notorious gay basher, gospel singer Donnie McClurkin.

Program of
Howard Brown
BY AMY WOOTEN
￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼The Lesbian Community Cancer Project is becom- ing a program of Howard Brown Health Center with the new name of Lesbian Community Care Project, still with the initials LCCP.
The original LCCP, which has been housed within Howard Brown since 2004, announced Oct. 24 that it will join forces with the agency. The heads of both organizations described the decision as a logical next step toward the con- tinuation of a symbiotic relationship.
“We will serve our community better together than we are doing separately,” said LCCP Board Chair Dominique Leonardi, who will now become a Howard Brown board member while the re- maining board members form an advisory com- mittee. Leonardi and others feel the merger will help expand lesbian healthcare in the area.
LCCP was founded in 1990 to address the healthcare needs of lesbian and bisexual women. Howard Brown has been serving the needs of the LGBT community since 1974, and is one of the nation’s largest agencies.
“This is a good day for Howard Brown, this is a good day for LCCP and this is a good day for the community,” Howard Brown President and CEO

The struggles
of Homeless Trans Youth
BY CHARLSIE DEWEY
Homeless LGBT youth face increased dif culties compared to their heterosexual counterparts both on the streets and within the shelter sys- tem, according to a study the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force report, “Lesbian, Gay, Bisexu- al and Transgender Youth: An Epidemic of Home- lessness,” which was released in January 2007.
According to the report, LGBT homeless youth are more vulnerable to mental health issues, sub- stance abuse, risky sexual behavior and victim- ization. The report states, “A study of homeless youth in Canada found that those who identify as LGBT were three times as likely to participate in survival sex than their heterosexual peers,” and The National Runaway Switchboard report- ed, “LGBT homeless youth are seven times more likely than their heterosexual peers to be victims of crime.”
Shelter systems do not ease many of these risks for LGBT teens. “The majority of existing shelters and other care systems are not provid- ing safe and effective services to LGBT homeless youth,” the report states.
For trans youth the barriers increase. “Trans- gender youth are disproportionately represented in the homeless population. More generally, some reports indicate that one in  ve trans- gender individuals need or are at risk of need- ing homeless shelter assistance. However, most shelters are segregated by birth sex, regardless of the individuals gender identity, and homeless transgender youth are even ostracized by some agencies that serve their LGB peers,” according to the document.
Trans youth experience and fear violence, ha- rassment and discrimination within the shelters
and, for many, staying in a shelter can be less safe than spending the night on the street.
Over the past few years, individuals working with homeless youth in Chicago note several positive changes for LGB teens, as more shelters work to understand the complex issues facing these youth; however, trans youth are still expe- riencing disturbing dif culties.
“I think all of the youth shelter programs are cognizant of the fact that LGBT youth are a huge proportion of this epidemic, and I think they’re trying harder than ever, especially in the last 5 to 7 years, to make sure their spaces are af rm- ing and safe for LGBT individuals. I think the trans piece is still the complicated piece,” ex- plained Joe Hollendoner, director of the Howard Brown Broadway Youth Center.
“I feel like they are very committed to making space that is safe to LGBT young people, how- ever, I think again, that the shelter system re-  ects a larger societal issue, if we have a culture that perpetuates heterosexism, homophobia and transphobia then, clearly our shelter program is going to perpetuate that, compounded with is- sues of race and class,” he said.
Myrl Beam, also of Howard Brown, echoes Hol- lendoner’s statements, explaining how issues of employment discrimination, violence at school, homophobia, transphobia, and racism as well as police harassment create several more barriers towards healthy development for trans youth.
Employers do not understand transgender in- dividuals and compounding that with homeless- ness also creates a nearly impossible situation in the work place. Barbara Bolsen, vice president of programs for The Night Ministry, explained what she has seen over her many years serving home- less youth, “I think when you are a young per- son and you are trying to understand yourself, your identity and who you are, it can be a hard thing to be doing that and also to be homeless and trying to  gure out how to support yourself. I certainly saw for some of those young people, it was hard for them to get jobs and keep jobs. Particularly if they were at a period where they
Jen Rude, a youth outreach professional with The Night Ministry, at a recent youth street outreach event in Lakeview.
were just starting to  gure out which identity to be and to live as.”
Another signi cant barrier is police harass- ment. Beam said that the LGBT community could help protect trans youth by holding police ac- countable. She also said, “As a queer community we need to really take on the work of transform- ing our minds and our lives in our communities and our businesses and actually make opportu- nities available for trans people. We need to take on the cause of dismantling transphobia.”
Funding for more beds and services is also a vital component to help homeless youth. “The need far outweighs the resources in the crisis moment, when young people need some place to go in the dead of winter, there is nowhere, so it forces young people to make unsafe decisions, which puts them in contact with the criminal justice system through no fault of their own, be- cause there are no other choices. So, increasing the number of beds is critical and then making sure those beds are accessible to trans youth,” Beam explained.
At this point, federal and local funding for homeless youth shelters and services does not come close to meeting the projected need, which means that while many individuals working with homeless youth here in Chicago agree that LGBT
speci c shelters and services would greatly in- crease the safety and healthy development of LGBT teens, and trans teens especially, funding just isn’t available. Presently in Chicago, there are no LGBT-speci c shelters and none planned for the future.
Hollendoner said, “I think in the current land- scape of things it’s important that we ensure that the beds that exist now are safe for LGBT individuals and speci cally for trans individuals. I think the experiences of trans youth within shelter programs are particularly concerning to me and to my colleagues. I think it is critically important that our existing beds are safe for ev- eryone. I also believe that if resources became available that having a shelter program speci - cally for LGBT youth would be a wonderful asset to the community ... [but], I think it’s really important not just to develop an LGBT homeless youth center and say okay well that’s where all the homeless LGBT youth go and not hold other shelter programming accountable to making sure LGBT youth are safe in their shelter.”
Another aspect of providing safe housing is transforming the way the shelter systems cat- egorize youth. Hollendoner said, “I think that so often our shelter programs are based on a binary gender system and I think that through- out the youth community you see that binary gender systems aren’t the way in which youth describe their bodies and that there’s a  uidity around gender now and I think that the shelter programs are now just beginning to understand that.”
Sol Flores, executive director of La Casa Norte, explained how the Solid Ground Supportive Housing Program, a project-based housing unit speci cally serving male youth aged 16-21 that is part of La Casa Norte, is approaching hous- ing transitioning youth: “We created eligibility guidelines in the transgender area that say if you identify and are living currently as a male you can come into the program, because it is a male intentional program...we could have some- one who is going through the transition as long as he is identifying as and living as a male.”
Solid Ground’s private room system also pro- vides privacy for its residents, which Flores be- lieves has a positive impact allowing for privacy that many sheltered youth don’t’ receive.
Training and education for staff was also cited as a way to decrease discrimination. “I certainly think that training is a very positive thing. ... It creates a better environment for everybody,” Bolsen said.

Homeless
Confab
BY AMY WOOTEN
Local organization Teen Living Programs was the only Chicago agency to attend the recent  rst national advisory council meeting on LGBTQ youth homelessness.
The event, which took place Oct. 19, was “long overdue,” said Dr. Ozella Phillips who at- tended the conference. She serves as a member of Teen Living Programs’ leadership team. At the meeting, agencies discussed the growing problem of LGBT homelessness, the lack of gov- ernment funding and more.
Teen Living Programs works with homeless youth in the Chicago area, and is an agency committed to inclusion.
Although the East and West coasts appear to be more progressive when it comes to tackling the problem of LGBT youth homelessness, Phil- lips said she learned that Chicago is de nitely ahead of the game compared to other Mid-
western cities because it has more welcoming agencies. The third largest city in the country, however, is struggling to address the growing problem of LGBT youth on the streets.
Phillips said that her passion for inclusion was “further ignited” after leaving the national meeting, especially because she was surround- ed by discussions of the ongoing Employment Non-Discrimination Act controversy.
“It’s easy to marginalize those who are al- ready marginalized,” she said.
In Phillips’ opinion, LGBT agencies shouldn’t be the only ones responsible for solving the problem of homelessness among its youth. She agrees that although they play a large role, LGBT organizations shouldn’t be the only ones working towards a solution. “They need strong support, and I don’t think they can do it alone,” she said.
In order for progress to be made in the Chi- cago area, “partnership has to happen,” Phil- lips stressed, adding that agencies, community members, politicians and others need to work together and create a solution and alleviate the issues LGBT homeless youth face. Most im- portant, Phillips said, is that the community listen to what LGBT youth need and want.
“Our young people’s voices need to be heard,” she said.

LCCP from cover
Michael Cook said. Cook said the two agencies decided after a few years of dating to “ nally get married,” describing the relationship as “love at  rst sight.”
Over the past few years, while housed at Howard Brown, the organization has “achieved more than we thought possible,” said LCCP In- terim Executive Director Catherine Jefcoat.
Jefcoat will join Howard Brown’s senior man- agement team as Director of the Lesbian Com- munity Care Project.
The lesbian healthcare organization has walked hundreds of women through cancer screenings, created a smoking cessation pro- gram, conducted studies, trained more than 1,000 healthcare workers and reached out to thousands of women since it moved in to How- ard Brown.
Both Jefcoat and Cook are con dent the new relationship will expand lesbian healthcare in the area. Since LCCP has moved into the agency, the number of women served at Howard Brown Health Center has doubled, Jefcoat said. The organization also plans to build and expand programs.
Cook believes both organizations will become stronger because of the merger. When asked if the merger speaks to lesbian agencies not be- ing able to stand alone, he replied, “This is and should be one community.”
Community leader Art Johnston was in at- tendance at the announcement, and expressed concern over whether or not the organiza- tion will continue its focus on cancer. Jefcoat promised that the focus on cancer would con- tinue, and that the name was changed to re-  ect LCCP’s opportunity to expand its services and programs.
“We aren’t abandoning the cancer issue,” Cook said, adding that the only change is the expansion of care.

sources become tighter, the merger allows both Howard Brown and LCCP to reach out to more women, and only strengthens them both.
Former LCCP Executive Director Jessica Halem was around for the agency’s move into Howard Brown’s building in 2004, and said the ulti- mate goal at the time, if all went well, was a merger. She told Windy City Times she has “zero concerns” about the new relationship, and is “thrilled” to hear the news.
“I think it’s a great day for people in the community,” Halem said, adding that it would be “unethical” for LCCP to not take advantage of the large, holistic healthcare environment Howard Brown has to offer. She hopes that the merger will bring in trans individuals and women by the droves.
Former board member Renae Ogletree also said the news didn’t surprise her. “I predicted that [they would merge] three years ago” when LCCP moved into Howard Brown Health Center, she said.
Ogletree expressed some concern over how much LCCP might change as an organization in the long run, and whether or not Howard Brown will include more women on its board in order to account for the merger.

Eric Alva:
Courage
Under Fire
BY JEAN ALBRIGHT
Former Marine Staff Sgt. Eric Alva, along with Rochelle Crump, former Assistant Director of Veterans Affairs for the State of Illinois, will speak at the American Veterans for Equal Rights (LGBT Veterans) Veterans Day Dinner, Sun., Nov. 11, 5:30-9 p.m. at the Center on Halsted.
Alva was following in the footsteps of his father and grandfather when he joined the Ma- rines at the age of 19. He had been a Marine for 13 years and was serving in Bagdad when— on March 21, 2003, the  rst day of Operation Iraqi Freedom—his right foot found a land mine next to his Humvee. One arm was shat- tered, and one leg was destroyed. Alva became the  rst casualty of the Iraq War.
On his return to the states and during the early days of his recovery, he was visited by and photographed with Donald Rumsfeld and other dignitaries. He was awarded a Purple Heart by the president. As he adapted to the loss of his leg and returned to health, he be- gan public speaking on both military service and sports participation for the disabled. He appeared in and on everything from the Oprah Winfrey Show to People Magazine to the Run- ner Triathlete News.
In late 2006, he bagan to look for opportu- nities to support another group of which he had been a member—gays in the military. Al- though he was out and honest with many Ma- rine friends, he said his gay identi cation had not  gured as a primary consideration while he was serving.
“As a Marine, I was all about the work,” he said. “If I ever decided to try to meet someone of the same sex for a relationship, I knew that would have to come later in my life.”
But, while still in the spotlight as the  rst injured Marine of the con ict, it bothered him that under the military’s Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell policy an average of two servicemembers a day, many of whom have key skills, were being discharged and that those facts are not widely understood.
In 2006, Alva’s partner, Darrell Parsons, was already involved with the Human Rights Cam- paign (HRC) and suggested that Alva offer his services to the organization.
“We were interested in the civil rights work and I sent an email asking if there was anything I could do. I assumed that it would be some- thing like running a pride booth. After they’d looked into my credentials, they saw what the opportunity was and asked for a meeting.”
He has since traveled widely for speaking engagements and local and national media ap- pearances. He was featured on the Legacy of Service Tour and spoke at the February reintro- duction to the House of Representatives of the Military Readiness Enhancement Act.
In March, when Gen. Peter Pace, then-chair- man of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS), said that he supported Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell based on his own beliefs that homosexual acts “are immor- al,” Alva was a prime candidate to respond.
These remarks by the chairman of the JCS, “...were disrespectful and insulting to the thousands of men and women who are serving in the military at this current time under the policy,” he told CNN’s Paula Zahn.
As he has gone on to educate the public on the rami cations of the Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell, Alva said that few questions from the audi- ence surprise him now but some do lead him to spend his time at home on research and get- ting deeper into related topics.
“You can tell by audience reaction that it is necessary, that it is news to them, by their eyes, their body language.” he said. “It has been a blessing to survive the war and now to do this work, helping spread the word about what Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell really means in the lives of those affected by it.”
Some of those questions concern the future of the policy.
“As I watch the debates, and hear support from the Democratic candidates for overturn- ing Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell—and none from the Republican ones—I’m looking for the next Commander in Chief, “ he said. “Can they say, ‘I support the troops, but, wait, no, if you are not straight, you cannot hope for the same things in life’?
“I’ve earned their thanks for my service, but how far does that go? This limitation shows that we still accept discrimination. We’re at- tempting to be a model country for the rest of world, and gays serve openly and well in other countries. How much longer are we going be hypocritical?”
Tickets to the Nov. 11 event are $40, which covers cocktails and dinner. For info or reservations, call Jim Darby at 773-752- 0058.

McKeon Receives Foundation
Grant
Allen A. Schuh, president of The Anderson Prize Foundation, has announced that longtime Illinois activist Larry McKeon is the recipient of the 2007 Stonewall Award, which recognizes his longstanding service to the LGBT community. The $30,000 unrestricted cash award was pre- sented to McKeon after an anonymous nomina- tion process.
The Anderson Prize Foundation has awarded its Stonewall Awards since 1991 to GLBT and HIV activists. Established by Paul A. Anderson of Chicago before his death of AIDS-related causes in 1992, the Foundation is overseen by Allen A. Schuh, Anderson’s companion of 13 years and an attorney residing in San Francisco and Chicago.
“Larry was not only the  rst openly gay rep- resentative in the Illinois legislature,” Schuh said. “More courageously, he was one of the  rst elected representatives in the U.S. who acknowl- edged being HIV-positive. By his presence and
example as a gay and HIV-positive individual working day-to-day on both [LGBT] and ordinary legislative business, Larry overcame widespread homophobia in government, achieving the larg- est majority in support of gay and lesbian rights in Illinois history. The Anderson Prize Founda- tion is pleased to give something back to Larry for his sel ess commitment to our community.”
“To be honored with The Anderson Prize Foun- dation’s award is especially meaningful, because I knew Paul Anderson and appreciated his im- portant philanthropic work in our communities two decades ago,” McKeon said. “The Prize he funded before he died has recognized many ac- tivists over the years who might otherwise have gone unacknowledged, and I am honored to be among them.”
Among McKeon’s legislative achievements is an amendment to the Illinois Human Rights Act, passed in 2005 after 30 years of attempts to achieve state-wide legislation banning discrimi- nation against LGBT citizens. “I am very proud of my success in passing the Human Rights Amend- ment during my career as a lawmaker,” McKeon said.
In addition, McKeon sponsored and achieved passage of revisions to the Illinois organ donor act that allows transplantation of organs be- tween individuals who are co-infected with HIV and viral hepatitis.
McKeon, 63, is an Idaho native who began his public service career more than 40 years ago. He was elected to  ve consecutive two-year terms in the Illinois House, representing the 13th dis- trict on Chicago’s North side, “one of the most diverse in the State of Illinois,” according to McKeon. He has also served as a director of the City of Chicago’s Commission on Human Rela- tions and as Mayor Richard M. Daley’s liaison to the Chicago’s Gay and Lesbian communities, among other posts.

On a ‘Personal’
Mission
BY AMY WOOTEN
Out lesbian co-chair of Personal PAC’s upcom- ing 14th Annual Awards Luncheon, Gail Morse, thinks everyone should be an activist.
After all, she said, issues such as a woman’s right to choose impact everyone—even the gay and lesbian community—in some way.
The Annual Awards Luncheon, which takes place Nov. 5, honors pro-choice activists and supporters. The event is the largest fundraiser for Personal PAC, a bipartisan statewide organi- zation that supports pro-choice candidates for of ce. Marcie Love, who founded Personal PAC at her kitchen table in 1978, will receive the Irving B. Harris Spirit of Choice Award for her activism. (Tracy Fischman and Faith Pennick will receive Pro-Choice Leadership Awards.) This year, the special guest of the event is ac- tress and activist Kathleen Turner.
“She’s great because [Turner’s] not only a well-known name, but she’s also a passionate advocate for women’s and children’s health,” Morse said.
Personal PAC started as an organization that combatted anti-choice legislation. “As it’s become more successful, it has been able to become more proactive and supportive legisla- tion and candidates,” said Morse, who serves on the organization’s board.
Morse is very active in the community, in addition to practicing tax law as a partner at Jenner &amp; Block. She is active in the Women’s Bar Association of Illinois and serves on the board of directors for The Women’s Treatment Center, Vital Bridges and The Illinois Women’s Institute for Leadership. She is also a com- missioner on the Cook County Commission on Women’s Issues.
As someone who is so active, Morse doesn’t understand the complacency so many people have when it comes to political issues.
“We will lose the right to choose if we don’t have an organization like Personal PAC out there,” she said.
One only needs to look at what happened in Aurora over the opening of a Planned Parent- hood clinic, she provided as an example. Ac- cording to Morse, apathy and the belief that a women’s right to choose can’t be taken away simply because it’s 2007 is a dangerous way to think. The right to choose, she feels, requires “constant vigilance.”
“As a lesbian, it’s not only that I’m a woman and this is important to me from a health and choice perspective—these are the same people out there who say gay people don’t have a right to exist,” she said. “Or that we shouldn’t be recognized in any formal manner.”
Morse, who grew up in the ‘70s, was inspired by the women’s liberation movement. “We thought that was all behind us, but it’s not,” she said.
As she grew up, Morse was surrounded by ac- tivism. Her aunt, who she considers her politi- cal mentor, was a union organizer in southern California. She can’t remember a time when she wasn’t an activist, which is just one more reason why she can’t understand widespread apathy.
“Politics affects everything we do from the moment we wake up, to the moment we go to bed,” Morse said. “If you think that it doesn’t, you’re naïve.”
“Government is supposed to do what it is supposed to do, which is to provide safety,” she said. “It’s not supposed to be in my bed- room.”
Personal PAC hopes to see a lot of support from the gay and lesbian community at the luncheon. “This issue impacts us not just as gays and lesbian, not just as women, but also as individuals,” said Morse.

BY ANDREW DAVIS
Dan Majewski, co-owner of the leather bars Cell Block (Chicago) and the Eagle (Detroit), passed away Oct. 21 in Detroit of a massive heart attack. He was 45.
Majewski was the beloved son of Dorothy and the late Ervin Majewski; the loving broth- er of David (Gwen) and Kenneth; and the loving partner of Frank Blondale and Thomas Stabnicki. He was also the dear uncle of Tom, Jamie, Kenneth and Marc.
Visitation was held Oct. 24 at Charles R. Step Funeral Home in Redford Township, Mich. There was no funeral because Majewski requested to be cremated.
In a letter that has been posted on sev- eral Web sites, including ChicagoDen.com, Blondale said that “[t]he one thing that Dan- ny WAS passionate about was bartending.”
Blondale added that “[Majewski] was, at various times, my lover, my best friend, my critic, and my supporter—and he has always been my partner in the unique way that we de ned.”
When asked what he would miss most about Majewski, Blondale told Windy City Times that it was “being able to go to him with my ideas, and have him temper and guide them.”
Blondale—Majewski’s business partner as well as a life partner of 26 years—said that a memorial is being planned at the Cell Block in early December, near Majewski’s birthday. Details will be made available after they are  nalized.

THAT’s NUTs!:
The Fight for
Our sanity
BY ERIC MARCUS
Sometimes I think I’m crazy. I’m often anxious, occasionally hypochondriacal. And a deep sense of foreboding  ows through my veins as it did through the veins of my great-grandparents, who  ed Eastern Europe ahead of pogroms and the Nazis because they knew at a cellular level that bad things were going to happen (there are advantages to expecting the worst when it gets you out of harm’s way).
My therapist tells me I’m perfectly normal for a mildly neurotic, middle-aged Jewish gay guy who has just buried his mother, grandmother, and both in-laws over a period of 24 months. But I’m not sure I agree with his benign as- sessment because I often felt a little crazy long before this current run of bad luck.
If this were 1967 instead of 2007, my suspi- cions about my sanity (or lack of it) could have easily been con rmed in the pages of the Di- agnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Dis- orders (DSM). Right there in black and white the American Psychiatric Association (APA) said unequivocally that as a homosexual I was by na- ture mentally ill.
Kidding aside, I know that the kind of crazy I sometimes feel is no different from what a lot of perfectly normal people experience and it has nothing to do with the fact I’m gay. And by 1973 the APA came around to this idea, voting in that year to remove homosexuality from its list of mental disorders. As one local Philadel- phia newspaper archly proclaimed on its front page following the of cial change of heart: “20 Million Homosexuals Gain Instant Cure.”
It’s a little hard to imagine today the heavy burden of the “sickness” diagnosis. You could be  red from your job or not hired in the  rst place. After all, you couldn’t possibly employ someone who is mentally ill to teach children, care for the sick, or prepare your taxes. And pity the gay parent trying to hang on to her or his kids in a divorce proceeding.
The sickness diagnosis also meant there was something to cure, which gave rise to a whole industry whose purpose was to help homosexu- als recover from their disorder. So in the name of science and the medical and mental health pro- fessions, untold numbers of gay men and women were subjected to everything from endless years of fruitless psychoanalysis and devastating elec- tro-convulsive therapy to hormone treatments, aversion therapy (“Now why don’t you sit back

The majority of gay women and men were lucky enough to escape the clutches of the mostly well-intentioned professionals, but they were still condemned to the mental torture of living with the knowledge and stigma that they were classi ed as mentally ill. And for those who tried to cure themselves, the futile pursuit of ban- ishing same-sex attraction was enough to drive even the most grounded gay person over the edge.
While the 1973 de-listing might in retrospect look like a common sense and easy decision, it was in reality a very contentious process and it was years in the making. The seeds of our sanity conversion were, in fact, planted more than six decades ago by a gay, part-time college student, named Sam Fromm. And it was nurtured by a small group of persistent, mostly straight, psy- chologists and psychiatrists.
Sam Fromm got the ball rolling in 1945 when, after befriending his UCLA psychology professor, Dr. Evelyn Hooker, he urged her to make a study of “people like us.” As Dr. Hooker explained to me in a 1989 interview, “This bright young man, somewhere in his early thirties, had obviously been thinking about this for a long time. And by ‘people like us’ he meant, ‘We’re homosexual, but we don’t need psychiatrists. We don’t need psychologists. We’re not insane. We’re not any of those things they say we are.”
Realizing that no one had ever thought to ques- tion the homosexual sickness label, Dr. Hooker decided to take up Sam’s challenge and began her pioneering— and for the time—extremely bold and professionally dangerous research.

To bathroom cruisers, this means, “Come closer to the wall so I can touch you.” In a post-arrest interview with the arrest- ing of cer on June 11, Craig said, “I remember reaching down once; there was a piece of toilet paper back behind me, and picking it up.” This NBC interview and one the same evening on Boi- se’s KTVB added the element of the toilet paper being underneath or stuck to Craig’s shoe.
“WHILE MANY AMERICANS MAY ONLY BE VAGUELY FAMILIAR WITH THE IDEA OF ‘CRUISING,’ there is a secret world of sex be- tween men that exists in public places across the country. ... Public places like men’s rest- rooms, in airports and train stations, truck stops, university libraries and parks, have long been places where gay and bisexual men, particularly those in the closet, congregate in order to meet for anonymous sex. Over time, people familiar with cruising told ABCNEWS. com, gay men began using a codi ed system of signals to indicate to others that they were interested in sex.” — ABC News covering the Sen. Larry Craig toilet-sex scandal, Aug. 28.

￼￼￼￼￼￼OBAMA from cover
“McClurkin [is] black, he’s popular, and gospel plays big with blacks in South Carolina, especial- ly among evangelical, and many of them openly and even more of the quietly loathe gays.”
The candidate and the singer reportedly met at a September fundraiser for Obama hosted by Oprah Winfrey at her California mansion.
H. Alexander Robinson, CEO of the National Black Justice Coalition (NBJC), said on October 23, “For Sen. Obama to align himself with pub- licly antigay individuals is both hurtful and dis- appointing. Rev. Donnie McClurkin once stated that he was at ‘war’ with the LGBT community, stating, ‘The gloves are off and if there’s going to be a war, there’s going to be a war...I’m not in the mood to play with those who are trying to kill our children.’”
The coalition was one of many groups within the gay community who called upon Obama to distance themselves from the antigay rhetoric.
Obama’s response
The campaign issued a statement from Obama saying, “I strongly believe that African Ameri- cans and the LGBT community must stand to- gether in the  ght for equal rights. And so I strongly disagree with Rev. McClurkin’s views and will continue to  ght for these rights as President of the United States to ensure that America is a country that spreads tolerance in- stead of division.” The singer remained on the program.
The campaign posted the statement on the GLBT segment of the website, but not among the general news releases.
The response prompted blogger John Aravosis to write on Americablog.com, “That’s nice Sena- tor. You strongly disagree with the bigot who thinks I need to be cured, and who has declared ‘war’ on me and my people, but you’re going to put the guy on stage with you anyway in order to make a few bucks. Nice. I wonder what Obama would say if Hillary invited [Nazi/racist] David Duke to speak at an event but then said, not to worry, she really loves black people—kisses!”
The Human Rights Campaign was more diplo- matic, but not molli ed. It expressed apprecia- tion of the gesture by the campaign, but also disappointment that it had not done more. Pres- ident Joe Solmonese said, “There is no gospel in Donnie McClurkin’s message for gay[s]. That’s a message that certainly doesn’t belong on any presidential candidate’s stage.”
The Obama campaign belatedly tried to “bal- ance” the situation by adding an openly gay minister to the program. Rev. Andy Sidden is pas- tor of Garden of Grace United Church of Christ, in Columbia, S.C. It is a former parish of the Metropolitan Community Church. The campaign rejected possible black ministers suggested by the NCBJ.
That created a new set of problems—Sidden is white. Pam Spaulding, writing on her blog pam- shouseblend.com, said, “It boggles the mind that the Obama campaign would select a white pastor to deal with a situation that is awash in black homophobia. Politics 101...Barack Obama is clearly showing he doesn’t understand the need of the religious black community to see one of their own deliver that message.”
“The last thing a crowd of black folks who have a problem with homosexuality needs is: 1) to be ‘told’ by the Obama campaign that a mes- sage about tolerance must be delivered from a white voice of faith, and 2) to have their beliefs con rmed that being gay is ‘a white man’s per- version.’ Coming from a white pastor under these circumstances, can only be seen as paternalistic and patronizing; the shields of defensiveness will go up, the message will be ignored.”
The campaign’s born-again 25-year-old direc- tor of religious affairs, Joshua DuBois, held an Oct. 25 conference call with leaders of the South Carolina Gay and Lesbian Pride Movement to try to defuse the situation. It didn’t work; 15-20 members ended up staging a vigil outside the event on Sunday night.
kin stoked the  ames further in the closing seg- ment of the concert. “Don’t call me a bigot or antigay when I have suffered the same feelings” he told the audience. “God delivered me from homosexuality. God is the only way.”
As John Aravosis wrote the next morning, “In the end, Obama let his ‘best’ and ‘favorite’ artist slam gays to thousands of African Americans, in his name, and neither he nor his hand-chosen white gay preacher said anything in response.”
Political ineptitude
Chicago political consultant Michael Bauer, who has personal ties to Obama, was appalled by the ineptitude of the campaign staff. He said a principal responsibility of the staff is to make sure that such mistakes do not happen and draw the candidate and media off the message of the day.
But there have been repeated incidents of such gaffes with the gay community and with a broader audience, such as earlier this year in making a weak response to then-Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Peter Pace’s character- ization of gays as “immoral.”
He blames it on the staff more than the candi- date, but acknowledges that Obama must shoul- der the ultimate responsibility. Bauer’s principal questions are who is going to be held account-
able and who is going to be  red for the political ineptitude.
Bauer made the comparison with George Bush and the President’s loyalty to people like Alberto Gonzalez and Donald Rumsfeld who were kept on despite continued screw-ups. “Barack is sup- posed to be different,” said Bauer, “but nobody is getting  red, nobody is being held account- able.”
Academician Ken Sherrill said, “Obama may have been caught by surprise with expressions of outrage came from LGBT leaders. The critical point, I fear, is that he didn’t know to handle the dispute. For better or worse, he didn’t tri- angulate and he didn’t mediate. He didn’t show those qualities of leadership and he didn’t show decisiveness.”
“Obama’s campaign promised to break with the politics of the past, but his behavior in this case is a classic example of the politics of the past,” Sherrill said. “I think it’s an example of the not-ready-for-prime-time aspect of Obama’s candidacy.”
The latest Los Angeles Times/Bloomberg poll shows that Obama “has lost strength in such groups as those with higher education and the af uent, which were the mainstays of his candi- dacy.” This latest misstep is not going to help.
Rather than let the matter die down, McClur-

￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼Obama the vote-whore with ‘ex-gay’ at his side
It was intended to be an unprecedented example of how Democratic presidential hopeful Barack Obama’s grassroots political campaign could win over just as many religious conservatives as Re- publicans can. Instead, it has run afoul with lesbi- an, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer support- ers, as well as others, who bought into Obama’s rhetoric as a healer and consensus builder.
At the Values Voter Summit in Washington last weekend, Obama’s campaign announced that they, too, could help conservative voters have a voice in the presidential campaign. They then an- nounced they would be hosting the “Embrace the Change! Gospel Series.” It’s a gospel fest to run in three South Carolina cities—Charleston, Green- wood and Columbia— this coming weekend with gospel mega-star Pastor Donnie McClurkin as part of the concert line-up.
It appeared to be an innocuous announcement showcasing some of gospel music’s most suc- cessful artists that would mark the  nal days of Obama’s “40 Days of Faith and Family” campaign in South Carolina. But it’s actually outing some of the black gospel chitlin’ circuit’s closeted gays ministers and biggest opponents of queer civil rights.
A reporter at the New York Daily News wrote me in an e-mail asking, “I’m writing a piece ... about Sen. Obama’s gospel tour and the fact that one of the performers, Donnie McClurkin, has suggested that gay tendencies can be ‘cured’ or resisted. ... I’m wondering how you feel speci cally about Mc- Clurkin acting as an ambassador for Obama to the
The Center responds
Dear Editor:
In response to the Letter to the Editor in the Oct. 24 issue of Windy City Times regarding Cen- ter on Halsted,  rst let me assure the writer that “an enormous, proud, colorful, identifying rain- bow  ag” is on its way. Displaying it alongside the American  ag has always been part of the design plan. We have been waiting for the proper city permits to erect the  agpoles, and approval (granted just this week) has taken a bit more time than we expected.
Additionally, we are actively promoting— through various means such as ongoing town hall meetings, community surveys and staff accessi- bility—opportunities where thoughtful comments and feedback are welcomed and appreciated.
While acknowledging Mr. Goodman’s many posi- tive references to our building, I must, however, address some of the assertions in his letter. Our lobby proudly displays banners, billboard-size signage and stacks of printed materials all pro- claiming that Center on Halsted is for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and questioning people diverse in age, race, color, gender and gender ex- pression, family composition and myriad other human qualities. Center on Halsted is also for allies of our community. We are delighted that straight mothers with babies in strollers eat lunch in our lobby (not that we can con dently identify whether those mothers or their children are gay or straight) next to openly affectionate gay and
African-American Southern Chris- tian community.”
Well, let me tell you. Mc- Clurkin is the poster boy for African-American ex-gay minis- tries. “There’s a group that says, ‘God made us this way,’ but then there’s another group that knows God didn’t make them that way,”
McClurkin has told the media. “Love is pulling you one way and lust is pulling you another, and your relationship with Jesus is tearing you.”
In the highly competitive race for black evangel- ical votes in South Carolina, McClurkin just might give Obama the needed edge. However, that edge will come at a cost far greater than having McClur- kin at his side. It comes at revealing how Obama is not only a vote-whore, but a race-card user as well.
The Obama/McClurkin alliance introduces Obama to McClurkin’s black and white Southern evangeli- cal base, which thinks Obama is neither Christian nor black enough.
And many observers are starting to realize just how much of a vote-whore Obama is. For example, MSNBC talk-show host Tucker Carlson suggested Obama’s faith is “suddenly conspicuous,” saying that Obama has only recently begun addressing his religious background as part of “a very cal- culated plan on the part of the Democratic Party to win” religious voters in the 2008 presidential race.
And though religion came to Obama late in life, and he was reared in a non-religious house- hold, he came to understand “the power of the African-American religious tradition to spur social change.” And how much Obama really covets the power of the black church for his own political aggrandizement, rather than for its religion, has raised questions in the minds of many.
When he ran for the U.S. Senate in 2004, Obama campaigned at the Salem Baptist Church on Chi- cago’s South Side. It’s the 22,000-member black mega-church of Rev. James Meeks, who has called homosexuality an evil sickness. Outside of the hal- lowed walls of church the Rev. James Meeks is State Senator James Meeks.
Obama knew to pander to his base.
Obama will continue to speak and write about the special relationship he has with his pastor, the Rev. Dr. Jeremiah Wright of Trinity United Church of Christ in Chicago, as long as it doesn’t run afoul of his ambitions. When news got out about Wright’s Afrocentric theology and Sunday sermons that disparagingly speak ill of whites and Israel, Obama immediately distanced himself. Yet these same sermons were not a problem for Obama when they were spiritually nurturing him into becom- ing a public  gure. And when news got out that Wright was to deliver the invocation when Obama formally announced his candidacy in February, Obama canceled his appearance.
Many African Americans also suspect Obama of using the “race card” to win their votes, but his emotional detachment with issues blacks care about is a big turnoff. African-American journalist and CNN contributor Roland Martin stated, “You can’t  nd one major moment where black voters have embraced him and showered him with love. I was highly critical of his performance at the June debate at Howard University because that was his crowd. But he failed to ignite the room. One huge Obama supporter told me that his daughter went to the event backing him, and came out loving [Hillary] Clinton.”
According to a recent CNN poll, Clinton leads Obama among black registered Democrats, 57 percent to 33 percent. African-American women overwhelmingly support Clinton 68 percent to 25 percent, whereas African-American men favor Obama 46 percent to 42 percent for Clinton. But it is African-American women who hit the polls in much greater numbers than African-American men.
McClurkin is not the only singer on the gospel tour who has publicly spewed vitriolic statements against LGBTQ people. But he is the biggest one Obama can use to try to win over black evangeli- cal voters.
So once again, Obama is proving that his cam- paign marketed as “The Audacity of Hope” is really based on the audacity of hypocrisy.

￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼lesbian couples. Indeed, by design, the lobby of Center on Halsted is an intersection between the Center and its neighborhood, between diverse seg- ments of the LGBT community and between LGBT and non-LGBT people. The lobby is a unique space in which straight people will view life through the LGBT prism, which can only lead to greater under- standing, awareness and equality.
Although we appreciate and stand on the foun- dation built by the Stonewall rioters and many activists since, and although we do not judge anyone’s desire for a “gay-only” space, we did not create the Center to be exclusionary (as most places once were for us). Our mission is to af-  rm the LGBT experience, not to be heterophobic. Moreover, while we applaud the author’s open- ness and his commitment to the community, for others whom we serve, acceptance of their own sexual orientation remains a struggle. The com- munity center was purposefully designed so that those wanting anonymity (for example, some participants in our youth program, or a middle- aged married man here to see a therapist) could enter the lobby more comfortably and discreetly through Whole Foods.
We are grati ed that we are able to serve so many different LGBT groups and constituents at the Center, from trans art collectives to gay men’s and lesbian volleyball leagues, from questioning teenagers to elders seeking social interaction. We welcome ALL people and are proud to do so. Modesto Tico Valle
Executive Director, Center on Halsted
No to public sex
Dear Editor:
I like to think of myself as middle-of-the-road when it comes to politics. President Eisenhower warned us that taking that position will open you up to the extremes of both sides of an issue. Maybe, because of the fear of being arrested, I never allowed myself to be involved in unlawful activities. In San Francisco during the 1960s, I was invited to a gay-rights group called SIR (Soci- ety for Individual Rights) and many of their mem- bers advocated having open public sex, whereever and whenever. Needless to say, I did not join the group then, and feel now that public sex, whether gay or straight, is unlawful. Maybe instead of us- ing plainclothes police in stings, they should con- sider placing uniformed of cers near or in places that are used for public sex.

Dance Preview: Dance Chicago
BY ERIC EATHERLY
Before we get into the frenzy of holiday madness and Sugar Plum Fairy overload, there is one last dance tradition of the season for us to enjoy. That tradition is Dance Chicago, the month-long dance festival that brings some of Chicago’s most vibrant talent together on one stage. What started in 1995 as an audience development project for dance artists has blossomed to an institution unlike anything else in the nation. This year the Dance Chicago season kicks off on Nov. 2 and runs through Dec. 2 at the Athenae- um Theatre, 2936 N. Southport. Audiences are offered 13 different programs of predominantly brand-new work, highlighting the richness and diversity of dance art in the Windy City.
The opening weekend (Nov. 2-4) and the grand  nale (Dec. 1-2) programs run the gamut on dance genres and include the crème de la crème of companies and artists, including River North Chicago, Deeply Rooted Productions, Giordano Jazz Dance, Istanbul Dance Theatre, Lucky Plush Productions, the Joffrey dancers and more. These programs are a great way to get a little sample of everything, ranging from jazz and modern to hip-hop, tap and Irish step-dancing.
New this year to Dance Chicago is the “Any- thing Goes” program (Nov. 29), a tribute to the late dance critic Ann Barzel. This program includes dance, comedy and cabaret, focusing on the most humorous elements of stage per- formance. A panel of judges will award the best performance with a $1,000 prize, so performers will undoubtedly be stepping it up. For audi- ences hungry for side-splitting physical theater and off-the-charts entertainment value, this program is the one.
Also new this year and certainly not to be missed is the “International Rhythms” program (Nov. 10-11). This unique line-up combines live

music with a global combination of dance styles. Highlighting the program is Ulele, an indepen- dent Chicago band blending ska, salsa and rock- and-roll, led by Winston “Stone” Damon. Also featured are an array of ethnic dance ensembles and live musicians that cover Latin, African, Turkish, Irish, Indian styles and more. The per- formance is arranged in one continuous  ow, creating an evening of multicultural inspiration, high energy and non-stop entertainment.
Returning to the Dance Chicago menu this year is the always popular “Jazz Fusion” program (Nov. 23-25), which exposes audiences to not only the best of the city’s jazz dance ensem- bles—like River North, Giordano Jazz Dance and Jump Rhythm Jazz Project—but also includes artists specializing in tap, hip-hop, urban street dance and every contemporary mixture thereof.
The audiences more intrigued by modern dance will probably enjoy the “New Moves” program (Nov. 8, 9, 15) and the “Best Moves” program (Nov. 17, 30). “New Moves” grants exposure to Chicago’s up-and-coming artists, the kind of talent most audiences haven’t had the treat of seeing very much before. The “Best Moves” events highlight more established companies or works from more seasoned choreographers. Either way, there will be plenty of enjoyable dancing to be seen.
What would Dance Chicago be without its sig- nature program, “Dance Slam”? “Dance Slam Part 1” (Nov. 13, 20, 27) works like American Idol for dance. This innovative and audience-interactive evening allows dancers, usually large ensembles that focus on precision work, to compete with pieces that are no more than  ve minutes long for the best audience reaction. “Part 2” (Nov. 28) brings  ve or six works from each of the three Part 1 programs together for the ultimate dance-off.
Dance Chicago once was a stationary dance festival. But now the organization hits the road with a repertory of only the best Dance Chicago works in “Stars of Dance Chicago.” This program, which works like a touring pick-up company, in- cludes choreography by some of the most in- ventive dancemakers working today, including Laurie Stallings, Eddy Ocampo, Melissa Thodos and more. (Look for a feature on Ocampo in an upcoming issue of Windy City Times.) Chicago- ans get to see the program on Nov. 16 and 18 before it dazzles the residents of other cities.
That’s hardly where the fun ends. Other pro- grams include the family-friendly “Dance for Kids, Too” (Nov. 3, 10, 17); the “Extended Views” program (Nov. 7 for contemporary, Nov. 14 for hip-hop) that features multiple works by dif- ferent award-winning choreographers; and the “Holiday Kids Show” (Nov. 24, Dec. 1), which includes excerpts of the most beloved holiday dances.
Dance Chicago is far from a run-of-the-mill dance showcase. Because every single night of its month-long run includes a different col- lection of artists (including multiple nights of the same program), it’s one of the best ways to gain insight into the talent and creativity of es- tablished and emerging artists, all in one spot. Dance Chicago has been a building block of our city’s choreographers and a launching site for our brightest performers for thirteen years and there’s no sign of slowing down.

￼￼Christine Ebersole Gets ‘Intimate’
BY JONATHAN ABARBANEL
Tony Award-winning musical star Christine Ebersole is in town Fri., Nov. 2, to perform “An Intimate Evening with Christine Ebersole” as a bene t for the Auditorium Theatre of Roosevelt University, with legendary pianist Billy Stritch accompanying her. Ebersole grew up in Winnetka and attended New Trier High School before attending the American Acad- emy of Dramatic Arts in New York.
“I left college when I was 20 and moved to New York City—by myself,” she said. “My very  rst job singing—one of my very  rst auditions—was at the Continental Baths. And I worked as a jazz singer at this place called Gypsy’s. Then after that I worked as a wait- ress, and it was from there that I got a Broad- way show. It wasn’t a musical, it was a play called Angel Street with Dina Merrill. And, of course, when the show closed in three weeks I was back begging for my old waitress job.”
Individual tickets to “An Intimate Eve- ning with Christine Ebersole” are $500- $750. Call 312-922-2110, ext. 368, or amartinez@auditoriumtheatre.org.

to be a Catholic. Luke (Tyler McGee, channeling his inner K-Fed) goes for Vanilla Ice-style street cred, rapping about bling for the King and bust- ing one jaw-dropping dance move after another. Abraham (Nick Verina) is the Jew in the group and the lyricist behind such pro-abstinence bal- lads You Make Me Wanna Wait. And Juan (Adam Zelasko) is the hot-tamale Mexican senor whose dance moves are as spicy as his Frito Bandito accent.
If you’re offended by any of this, you might want to leave before the Boyz bring out the ro- sary beads, cruci xes (cruci xii?) and Stars of David for the big dance off/exorcism.
“We are the Altar Boyz/and we’re gonna alter your minds,” they warble in one wondrously lame lyric. If they don’t exactly succeed on that front, they do offer up 85 minutes of the most fun one can have this side of the seven deadly sins.
tus of free citizens while their guardians lived. It’s helpful to know these things going into M.E.H. Lewis’ play because her characters, though ostensibly raised within their region’s “particular institution,” seem as unaware of its intricacies as if they had been dropped in from another planet. Not only do the young slaves, Tom and Cora, want things they are unlikely to get but they want them now, their impatience leading them to reject what practical means of attaining their goals are at their disposal in fa- vor of methods guaranteeing unnecessary risk. Their elders, both Black and white—who ought to be advising them of other options—likewise exhibit a curious ignorance of their own social
dynamics.
Lewis’ super cial view of her dramatic universe
often leads us to entertain suspicions regarding the characters’ motives. If quadroon Cora and plantation owner Lucius harbor genuine affec- tion for one another, then his offer to care for her and their illegitimate child is a generous one, given their circumstances. But her deci- sion to abort the baby she carries paints her as an opportunist piqued at the failure of her seduction-and-pregnancy scheme. And if we are to sympathize with Tom’s hideous fate, we must turn a blind eye to his own disregard for self- preservation. Yes, young people are often reck- less, but what about adults who do nothing to ward off the inevitable suffering?
This InFusion production supplies suf cient spectacle to blur its text’s comic-book ambi- ence: choreographer Kimosha P. Murphy and a corps of athletic dancers contribute African-in-  uenced kinetic interludes, an uncredited stag- eside percussionist punctuates the action with ticklish rhythms, Eve Breneman’s dialects are irreproachable and Don Tieri delivers a mentorly performance as the gentleman plantation-owner no worse than his times. But without a plau- sible story, we cannot bene t from the facts re- counted in this elementary school-level history lesson.
THEATER REVIEW
The plot is communion wafer-thin: The Boyz are giving the  nal concert of a world tour dur- ing which they’ve been saving souls with the help of corporate sponsor Sony and a fancy (Sony) contraption known as the Soul Sensor DX12. At the start of the show, the Soul Sensor indicates (with plenty of drama-inducing stage fog and neon and shiz) that a whopping 500 souls in the house are damned. Through song, dance and bad jokes about Mel Gibson, the Boyz bring that number down to zero.
Musical director Alan Bukowiecki has the boys miked to sonic-boom levels, which means that Gary Adler and Michael Patrick Walker’s hooka- licious score slams into the eardrums and sets them pounding like you’re in the front row at an Alice Cooper concert—which is a good thing. And while the Boyz mesh vocally into a single entity during ensemble numbers, each member has a distinct personality.
Matthew (Nick Lachey doppelganger Devin De- Santis) is the blindingly earnest lead singer, an All-American Eagle-Scout-on-white-bread heart- throb. Mark (Brian Crum, prettier than Miss America—and I mean that in a good way) is the fantabulously  aming homo whose soul-baring, coming out anthem, Epiphany, makes one proud

With harmonies that are tighter than, oh, a vir- gin’s butt and dance moves as irresistible as a big ol’ slab of sirloin on the last Friday of Lent, the Altar Boyz could probably turn the Apostles’ Creed into a TRL hit. Both a send-up of the pop- tastic wonders of boy bands and a satire on the genre wherein prettiness is more important than vocal chops, the Altar Boyz roars from start to  nish in a blaze of delightfully super cial glory.
Thanks to Stafford Arima’s play-it-broad-as- Mount-Sinai direction and Christopher Gatelli’s spectacular choreography, Altar Boyz is so stupid it’s smart, and it pops with the kind of athleticism that wouldn’t be out of place at an elite-level gymnastics meet.

“Créole” technically refers to descendants of foreign-born colonialists in the American South, but soon acquired speci c connotations of “mixed-ethnicity” lineage. Forget that Europe- ans and Africans on the Mediterranean rim had been intermarrying for centuries—the New World racial distinctions were based in the economy of commercial growers requiring a large resident la- bor force drawing only room and board for their wages. A slave who mothered a child sired by her owner might enjoy favored status among the servants, and the offspring privileged to learn a trade or even pursue an education—but under no circumstances would they be granted the sta-

BY SCOTT C. MORGAN
Near the end of Jersey Boys, the 2006 Tony Award-winning Broadway musical based upon the lives of Frankie Valli and The Four Seasons, one guy says being inducted into Rock and Roll Hall of Fame is the greatest honor you could ever receive. I disagree.
I feel being immortalized in a hit Broadway musical is a greater way of being celebrated than having your hit tunes stored in a Cleveland museum or culled for oldies CD compilations sold on TV. Think about it: Would the jazz great Fats Waller or stripper Gypsy Rose Lee have such a legendary status today if their work wasn’t constantly being celebrated and dramatized re- spectively in stage revivals of Ain’t Misbehavin’ or Gypsy?
By being transformed into musical theater characters of amazingly talented New Jersey guys who skyrocket to fame on their unique rock-and-roll sound, Frankie Valli and The Four Seasons will live on and on as Jersey Boys keeps on being staged.
Broadway is littered with jukebox musicals that crashed and burned despite having song cata- logues of Elvis Presley, Bob Dylan or The Beach Boys to name a few. What sets Jersey Boys apart is book writers Marshall Brickman and Rick Elice keep the songs sequentially attached to their creators instead of trying to shoehorn them into other contexts like the brainless ABBA campfest of Mamma Mia.
Having a dynamic director like Des McAnuff (The Who’s Tommy) who knows how to keep all the great stage pictures and heartfelt emotions moving at a constantly cinematic pace is price- less, especially in Klara Zieglerova’s whiz-bang set of moving locales lit to moody perfection by lighting designer Howell Binkley.
It also helps to have a tireless cast who per- form marathon singing with strong acting chops showing the dif culties that come with mas- sive fame, fortune and mob ties. Drew Gehling as songwriter Bob Gaudio, Michael Ingersoll as bass Nick Massi, Jeremy Kushnier as wiseguy Tommy DeVito and, especially, Jarrod Spector as Frankie Valli are all great performers, dispelling the slightest notion that you’re watching what is essentially a super-talented tribute band.
Jersey Boys. Photo by Joan Marcus
Great character work also comes from Craig Laurie as effete record producer Bob Crewe, Ra- shad Naylor in a slew of characters alongside the trio of Jenny Lee Ramos, Lauren Marshall and Lyndsey Cole, who dizzyingly play all the women’s roles.
Right now what overwhelmingly helps Jersey Boys is the heartfelt nostalgia of aging baby boomer audiences who once danced to, grew up with or fell in love alongside these distinctive tunes. I guess it’s a generational thing, but I wasn’t moved to instantly applaud as other au- dience members recognized song hits like Walk Like a Man or Can’t Take My Eyes Off You. My  rst
exposure to The Four Seasons was hearing Sherry on TV commercials for cherry licorice and Big Girls Don’t Cry as a Sesame Street educational parody, Big Birds Don’t Fly.
Even if Jersey Boys is a by-the-numbers stage bio, it’s so slickly produced and entertaining that it’s still an energizing night of theater. Frankie Valli and The Four Seasons couldn’t have asked for better show-biz immortality than Jer- sey Boys.

Twilight of the
Golds
Playwright: Jonathan Tolins
At: Apple Tree Theater, 1850 Green Bay, Highland Park
Phone: 847-432-4335; $38-$48 Through Nov. 11
BY SCOTT C. MORGAN
The scienti c community is a long way off from discovering if there is a “gay gene” or a bio- logical cause for homosexuality. But that hasn’t stopped us from speculating that such a discov- ery would bring either greater acceptance—or a  nal solution-type push to  x or eradicate any- one with same-sex inclinations.
This debate is what spurred Queer as Folk writ- er Jonathan Tolins to pen his ham- sted and semi-dated 1993 Broadway drama Twilight of the Golds, now being revived by Apple Tree Theater. If you think the title sounds deliberately close to Richard Wagner’s  nal Ring Cycle opera Göt- terdämmerung (Twilight of the Gods in transla- tion), you would unfortunately be correct.
Tolins symbolically apes Wager’s operas of the corrupt Norse gods’ destruction and subse- quent cleansing of the earth to aggrandize his
own drama, which is actually more like a poorly written what-if TV movie-of-the-week. Oh yeah, Twilight of the Golds was, in fact, turned into a cable TV movie with Brendan Fraiser and Jen- nifer Beals in 1997.
The play explores how expectant Jewish New York yuppie couple Rob Stein (Steven Marzolf) and his wife, Suzanne Gold-Stein (Elise Kauzla- ric), deal with futuristic medical technology that shows all biological and genetic signs sug- gesting that their son will grow up to be “like David,” Suzanne’s stereotypical opera-loving gay brother (Eddie Collins).
The news sends the whole family into a tail- spin, including Suzanne’s parents, Walter (Larry Wiley) and Phyllis Gold (Brigid Duffy), who al- ready had to deal with raising a gay son. Su- zanne and Rob weigh whether or not to abort, which causes the close-knit family to rupture.
This issue is certainly an important one to ponder, especially given that Nobel Prize-win- ning DNA scientist James Watson, the same ge- neticist who suggested years ago that women should be able to abort gay children, made recent headlines with racist genetic comments toward Africans. But the script of Twilight of the Golds is just inconsistent when it comes to its shallow and self-absorbed characters (it’s also unclear whether David is HIV-positive, which would explain some of the more insensitive fam- ily comments). The script also hasn’t aged well, especially with 1980s Wall Street insider trader Ivan Boesky being used as a punch line.
All this could be partially forgiven if director Tim Gregory had assembled a stellar cast at Ap- ple Tree Theatre. Unfortunately, the substandard dramatic material defeats this game and slightly miscast ensemble who can’t convincingly plumb the depths of the characters’ hidden biases that get blurted out (except for maybe Collins as Da- vid).
Twilight of the Golds is clearly a  awed piece of theater. But at least it gets people thinking and talking about what they might do in that situation and urges you to take sides.

￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼THEATER REVIEW
Ever After  nds the girls casting pages from their lives into a context of fairy-tale arche- types. Directed by Ann Boyd and written and performed by Sanders, Dorothy Milne, Clare No- lan and Pamela Webster, the collection of inter- locking stories twirls around motifs of witches, princesses and universal yearnings.
Ever After doesn’t break new ground: Mater- nity, men and the wonder and vulnerability of childhood are not new themes. But as mined by Sweat Girls, they gleam with bright clarity and brim with fearless authenticity. There’s a con- tagious gusto to the production, a full-hearted rambunctious verve that comes from embracing life in all its exasperating, exhilarating messi- ness. The Girls pull the audience through raging traf c snarls and weeping, lonesome sorrows, from the roaring catharsis of adolescent howls to the suburban tragedy of the sorceress next door.
The last opens and closes Ever After, in No- lan’s beguiling two-part tale of Hecate, the pas- tor’s wife who made the irredeemable mistake of celebrating her witchhood during Sycamore’s annual Pumpkin Fest Parade. Milne’s devilish explications of her magical powers over angry motorists, feral animals and boys who might be vampires is equally enchanting as is Webster’s evocation of the gales and gusts that de ned key moments of her life. And then there’s Sand- ers, part of the storied couple who longs for a child, but in a world where magic beans are hard to come by. It’s a tale that leaves one primed for whatever comes after Ever After.
his newfound love. Not too heavy and not too light, this is perfect opening night fare. The 8 p.m. screening will be preceded by a 6 p.m. sur ng-themed party (with hors d’oeuvres and open bar), appropriate given Shelter’s California beach locale. Both will be held at the Chicago History Museum.
The festival’s  rst week Spotlight Presentation (Nov. 9 at Landmark’s Century Centre Cinema) is A Four Letter Word, writer-director Casper An- dreas’ sequel to 2004’s Slutty Summer. In this installment, sexy party boy Luke  nds himself (gasp!) committing the gay mortal sin of falling in love. As the set-up would suggest, this falls right in line with other gay sex comedy romps like Another Gay Movie and Eating Out 2: Sloppy Seconds. If male eye candy is your thing, A Four Letter Word is your movie. An after party with hors d’oeuvres and cocktails follows the 7:30 p.m. screening.
Jamie Babbit, director of lesbian favorite But I’m a Cheerleader and last year’s underappreciat- ed The Quiet, returns with the black comedy Itty Bitty Titty Committee. Babbit’s movie follows a young innocent as she’s indoctrinated into an underground feminist group. This special event, on Nov. 16 at 7 p.m., is at Film Row Cinema at Columbia College and will be followed by a 9 p.m. after party at Crimson Lounge, 333 N. Dearborn, that will include food, cocktails, live entertainment and giveaways from “The L Word.” Stars of the Showtime series and the  lm may be on hand as well.
2 Minutes Later is Reeling’s second Spotlight Presentation. The  lm, which is described as a cross between  lm noir and a buddy movie, equally balances gay and lesbian characters. The 9 p.m. screening at Film Row Cinema will be fol- lowed by an after party at River East Art Center, 435 E. Illinois, that will also feature an art ex- hibit.
The festival’s gala closing night will again be- gin with a 6 p.m. reception at the Chicago History Museum followed by the 7:30 p.m. screening of The Curiosity of Chance, a charming, off-beat, queer-themed homage to ‘80s teen comedie. The  lm stars the adorable Tad Hilgenbrink (an Illi-

BY CATEY SULLIVAN
“Can I just make up a word here?,” Sweat Girl Martie Sanders asks midway through her autobi- ographical monologue on trying to have a baby. Can she ever: “Flabbergastation.” The word is the perfectly simple and completely complex punch line for a situation that’s simultaneously hilarious and heart-tugging. It wouldn’t do to reveal the context here so, suf ce to say, Sand- ers’ tale of a toe infection and an ER room doc reveal both the jaw-dropping depths of “ignora- manicality” physicians are capable of and the need for an addition to the English language.
“Flabbergastation” is one of the many perfect- ly assembled words that propel Sweatily Ever After, the latest offering from the monologists collectively known as The Sweat Girls. The Girls (the name is the result of a long-ago, late-night barroom confab) have been performing for 14 years, spinning the days of their lives if not into gold, then certainly into ingeniously com- pelling stories threaded through with wisdom, humor and insight. There’s an honesty to the Sweat Girls that eludes many another monolo- gist: Let the Spalding Grays (R.I.P.) of the world spin stagecraft from swimming to Cambodia and other such wildly melodramatic stuff; the Sweat Girls lack all pretension as they illuminate the extraordinary within the usual and the profun- dity in the everyday.

nois native), a high school senior and transfer to a new school who is the immediate target of the typical bullying jock. Tad, abetted by a group of other outsiders,  ghts back with queer panache and ingenuity, all the time nursing a crush on his super-hottie next-door neighbor (Eating Out 2: Sloppy Second’s star Brett Chukerman, yet an- other Illinois native). The  lm percolates along nicely, helped enormously by a hot soundtrack of some atypical ‘80s tracks. An after party begin- ning at 9:30 p.m. at Andy’s Jazz Club, 11 E. Hub- bard, features entertainment by Mercedes Hall who—in a nice bit of serendipity—is the mother of ‘80s icon Anthony Michael Hall.
The fest has dozens of  lms and shorts worth checking out. Here are a few notable high- lights:
—Butch Jamie (screens Nov. 9 at Landmark’s Century Centre Cinema) is a cute lesbian varia- tion on Tootsie in a winning debut from writer/ director/star Michelle Ehlen.
—Blueprint (screens Nov. 9 at Film Row Cine- ma) is a sexy and romantic story of two African- American queers falling in love in one day, from queer  lmmaker Kirk Shannon-Butts.
—Socket (screens Nov. 11 at Landmark’s Cen- tury Centre Cinema), a dark sci-  thriller along the lines of David Cronenberg’s Crash, is about a group of sexed-up folks addicted to, um, elec- tricity. Local fave Alexandra Billings is featured.
—Naked Boys Singing! (screens Nov. 13 at Landmark’s Century Centre Cinema), the screen adaptation of the long-running musical-sketch comedy hit features all those hit songs and all those naked boys. Bruce Vilanch, who contribut- ed special material for the  lm, makes a special appearance.
—The Gendercator (screens Nov. 14 at Center on Halsted) is a short gender-bending tale that uses Rip Van Winkle as its inspiration. A panel discussion follows this and its companion short, One in 2000.
—Starrbooty (screens Nov. 14 at Lakeshore Theatre) is the long-awaited full-length version of RuPaul’s superagent parody (Pam Grier meets Russ Meyer)—the character that  rst brought Supermodel of the World little Ru Ru renown in
the New York club scene. RuPaul is expected to attend the screening. An after party featuring karaoke will take place at Goose Island Brewery, 3535 N. Clark.
—Outing Riley (screens Nov. 15 at Film Row Cinema) is the Chicago-made sophomore effort from Project Greenlight’s  rst winner, writer- director Pete Jones. He also stars in this comedy about an architect from a typical Irish Catholic family who  nally gets up the courage to come out to his family, with surprising results.
—The Walker (screens Nov. 15 at Landmark’s Century Centre Cinema) stars Woody Harrelson as Carter Page III, the impeccably dressed, well- mannered and highly sought society escort of the wives of Washington powerbrokers (played by Lauren Bacall, Lily Tomlin and Kristin Scott Thomas). In between evenings at the opera and the latest bene t, Harrelson—as the gay Carter —enjoys a weekly card game and juicy gossip with his favorite swans. But when Carter gets mixed up in a murder case, his reputation and friendships are suddenly on the line. This inter- esting curio from writer-director Paul Schrader is a sort of gay variation on his American Gigolo —minus the sex. It’s slow-moving but a fasci- nating character study, nevertheless.
—Queerborn &amp; Perversion: An Early History of Lesbian &amp; Gay Chicago (screens Nov. 16 at Chicago History Museum) from documentary  lmmaker Ron Pajak wasn’t available for screen- ing but promises a fascinating look at local queer history during the years 1924-1974.
Screenings for the festival will be held at the Chicago History Museum, 1601 N. Clark; Landmark’s Century Centre Cinema, 2828 N. Clark; Film Row Cinema, 1104 S. Wabash, Third Floor; Center on Halsted, 3656 N. Hal- sted; Lakeshore Theater, 3175 N. Broadway; Leather Archives &amp; Museum, 6418 N. Green- view; and at Chicago Filmmakers, 5243 N. Clark.

Reeling 2007 Overview
BY RICHARD KNIGHT, JR.
Hollywood scorecard’s with regard to LGBT mov- ie fare has been poor to non-existent this past year further emphasizing the anomaly of 2005’s Brokeback Mountain, Capote, et al. But with Reeling 2007, Chicago’s International Gay and Lesbian Film Festival, our cup of LGBT-themed movies is about to run over. On Nov. 8-18, Chi- cago will be gay movie central, with movies and short subjects from 28 countries in virtually ev- ery genre.
This is Reeling’s 26th year, and a stellar event is planned. Celebrities from RuPaul to Bruce Vi- lanch will provide star wattage and the festival has added more pre- and post-screening parties. Shelter—the tale of Zach (Trevor Wright), a poor young artist and surfer who unexpectedly  nds himself in lust and in love with his wealthy best friend’s older brother (Brad Rowe of Billy’s Hollywood Screen Kiss), is the opening-night selection. Saddled with the responsibility of helping to raise the son of his party-girl sister, Zach tries to juggle the dif culty of coming out and making a life for himself as an artist and

Hearty
BY TRACY BAIM
Chicago-based Hearty Boys Dan Smith and Steve McDonagh have gone from caterers to restaurant owners and then on to stardom once they won The Next Food Network Star. They have remained at the top of their game, with HB: A Hearty Boys Spot, the Party Line Cooking Show, and now a new cookbook, Talk with Your Mouth Full: The Hearty Boys Cookbook.
We sat down with the longtime couple, both born in Queens, N.Y., as part of a new history project I am working on. For a more complete interview, see www.windycitymediagroup.com.
Tracy Baim: You two  rst met when you were both in theater in New York.
Dan Smith: We met in New York in 1986, and we both auditioned for The Fantastics, and it was a road show. So they had the auditions in this really kind of seedy place on the second  oor over a hot dog stand or something like that on Eighth or Ninth Avenue. It was kind of a cattle-call thing where everyone was in the room at the same time.
Steve McDonagh: It was a turning point in my life, but for you it was another notch. We were both at this audition, and Dan walked in the room, and I gasped, I literally made a gasping noise.
DS: You were choking on something [laughs].
SM: I was choking on my heart. It was  lled with love. But, if you want to put me down as I’m pouring out my heart [whispers] go for it. He walked in and I just gasped, and I was like, please let us both get in this show. He was wear- ing a wedding ring, so I just assumed he was

straight. ... So we went together, and we both got cast which was really exciting, and then I remember I asked him why he was wearing the ring, and he told me he got it from his boy- friend, [to Dan] you were really ahead of your time, because like we said that was like 1986.
DS: Yeah, well you know I never really dated. Ididn’tdatealotofguys....So,Ihadaboy- friend out of college, I met him in college, and so we were in a relationship, I think we were together for four years. And it was coming to an end when I met Steve.
SM: We both got cast, and it was a great time in rehearsal. Dan and I have always immediately connected, we just have an internal connection. We both got cast and we went away to ...
DS: ... Delaware.
SM: We dated that whole summer, knowing that Dan was in this relationship, and he’s like, well I’m breaking up with him. Of course, he did break up with him, and then subsequently broke up with me, because you just can’t go from one to another.
DS: Steve at that point was ready for a rela-
tionship, and I wasn’t.
TB: So fast forward, how many years later was it that ...
DS: We lost touch completely for  ve years, even though we both lived in New York City, we were both non-equity actors, we didn’t run into each other at all. Five years later, I ran into him on the street, in front of his apartment.
SM: We very very strongly believe in fate, there is no doubt in my mind that Dan and I were meant to be together, there is no doubt in my mind that I would put our relationship against the most staunchest religious right Republican who would say, you should not be together. After we bumped into each other in front of my apartment, it was just a matter of months before I moved to Florida, never to move back to New York, and Dan moved to Maine; if we hadn’t bumped into each other in front of my apartment, we never would have seen each other again. ... We made a real good friendship connection, and another  ve years after that, we became a couple again, and Dan moved to Chicago.
DS: We spent the second  ve years writing letters back and forth, from Maine to Florida. Before the Internet.
TB: Being East Coast guys, what brought you to Chicago?
SM: I came to Chicago not for any really inter- esting reason other than I didn’t want to live in New York anymore. You lived in New York, and ... one day it turns and it starts to suck you dry, and you just have to move. I wanted grass, and a place for my dog, and I wanted a healthy relationship and a little more space. I still love New York, I just didn’t want to live there any- more. So as a stage actor, my second choice was Chicago.
DS: I lived in Maine, I had a business in Maine, a café and a catering business. I was also in a relationship up there, which was a mess, so, you know I’ve been in three relationships in my life, and I don’t imagine that I’m going to be in another one. ... So when that ended, we again had been in touch for those  ve years, and I thought to myself, now is the time to make the move, because I always thought that Steve was the one that I shouldn’t have pushed away and walked away from, so I wanted it back. So we got back together when we both broke up with our exes, and I moved to Chicago.
SM: I moved to Chicago like ’91 probably, may- be ’92. I was 29 years old, I was here for just a matter of months before I had my thirtieth birthday party.
TB: So let’s talk about the incarnation of the Hearty Boys.
DS: I moved here in ’97 and I still owned the café back in Maine, I had leased it out, but I wanted to start the catering business here. I had worked for myself by that point for a good four or  ve years, I didn’t want to work for anybody else. So we started the Hearty Boys here, out of our eight-by-eight apartment kitchen in ’97.
SM: We were in Lakeview, on Hudson and Bel- mont, right by the lake. ... I was doing theater ever since I got here. I also knew that when I was between jobs, I didn’t want to work for anybody else anymore, working as a waiter or whatever, so it was easy when Dan got here to just say, let’s just start our own catering busi- ness. So we printed up little  iers with little tear sheets at the bottom with our number on it.
DS: It happened pretty quickly, and this is the deal with the Hearty Boys. We wanted to do what we know. As a gay couple, I wanted to go to somebody’s house, because we’d catered parties for other people, for other gay people. And you come in there, and it would be us and a straight guy, or you know just some random, somebody else. We wanted to say, we’ll make you comfortable in your house ...
SM: [With] gay-friendly staff, and we know you, we know your lifestyle, we’re going to cater to that. What’s really funny is, we weren’t going after a niche market ... we’re saying this is who we are, this is who you are, we just want to work
with what we know. And it took off really quick- ly, because it was a niche thing with disposable income, and honest to god, it’s funny to see the larger caterers now, all going for that. ... We just wanted to literally serve our community.
TB: How soon did the restaurant come into play?
DS: The restaurant took a while, we took like this, kind of [winding] path. We catered out of the Hotel Florence down in the Pullman dis- trict.
SM: Because they just called us one day and said, we’ve heard about you will you just take this kitchen over for us?
DS: So we saw a good opportunity there as well, because we thought, we can cater out of this kitchen as well ... we worked out of the Pullman kitchen for like six months, but in that time [around the year 2000], we were able to save up enough money, by running that restau- rant as well, that we were able to  nd that space in Lakeview on Halsted. ... In Boystown, which was a godsend. ... It wasn’t a ton of money, so we did most everything ourselves. We rehabbed the space ourselves. It was an old coffeehouse. We opened up as a gourmet takeaway at  rst. We had the catering business out of the back kitchen, and we had the front space.
TB: Let’s talk about the big break, I mean, the TV show.
DS: The TV show happened two and a half years ago, somewhere around there. We’d gone from gourmet takeaway to a café in the same space on Halsted. Steve, up until that point had still been acting ... .
SM: They say, we’re looking for the next Food Network star, send in your tape. You don’t really, because who’s really going to win that, right?
DS: So we though oh what the hell, we’ll just put a tape together and we’ll send it in and see what happens.
SM: [To] get a call and  nd out that we’re one of eight, we were concerned, because it was 10,000 entrants, so to be one of eight was the hard part, then we just had to, you know, knock the rest off systematically.
DS: It was ... really scary the  rst time, meet- ing everybody, because you didn’t know who you were going to be up against. But we held our own, and I felt good about that because I’m not classically trained, I never went to school to learn how to cook ... . I always thought that we would probably get to the  nal two, but we would never win because it was an America vote. America votes for the next food network star, and I thought, OK they’re not going to vote for the gay guys, it’s not going to happen. We’ll get to the  nal two and that will be great.
SM: Because we were also very much “out” on the show. The very  rst episode, our very  rst task was to make eggs. I was running through this in my head, and I thought, screw it. Screw it, I’m going to say this. We got up and I looked at the camera and I said, you know we have an unfair advantage because you’re asking us to make eggs and as gay boys, we know brunch. I was like, that’s either going to  y, or sink.
DS: They kept it in.
SM: And it took off because that’s who we are. The other thing was, we had been planning for a long time, we’re thinking how can we get a TV show, a cooking show? Because there are no cooking shows with a gay couple. How many gay people of either sex are in the kitchen? Tons, you know. I thought, this is a no-brainer, and if we don’t do it, somebody else is going to do it. We managed to do it through this weird sort of backdoor talent search.
DS: The thing about it though was that, on Food Network’s Web site during Food Network Star, they had all of these threads of conversa- tions that people could start, and the biggest thread that they had was about us. It was about us being gay, and a lot of people would write in and say, “I couldn’t even eat their food because they’ve touched it.”

Lambda Legal
Attorney Honored
BY AMY WOOTEN
Senior Attorney Camilla Taylor, the architect of Lambda Legal’s Iowa marriage victory, was a special guest at the organization’s latest Wine, Women and Lambda networking event.
An informal reception was held at Joie de Vine on Oct. 25 for the senior attorney who currently represents several lesbian and gay couples in an Iowa marriage lawsuit, Varnum v. Brien. Camilla made headlines in August when same-sex marriage became legal in Io- wa’s Polk County. However, that development lasted less than a day because the same judge who made the historic ruling later granted a stay. One couple was able to of cially get hitched during the short time frame.
Taylor shared her experiences with fellow attorneys, and answered questions regarding her strategies. At the event, Taylor said that even though Iowa isn’t the  rst state that comes to many people’s minds when same-sex marriage is discussed, Lambda Legal had been planning it for “quite a while” because they are very con dent of the outcome. She added that victory for same-sex marriage in Iowa could have a great “ripple effect” all over the Midwest and across the nation.

Tori Amos:
Queen of
Quirky
BY CHRIS AZZOPARDI
She’s a beloved gay icon. So, it was only a matter of time ’til the MILF’s daughter would start asking, ‘Mommy, what’s a homo?’
Tori Amos isn’t herself lately.
She’s Pip, a confrontational warrior. She’s
Isabel, a political photographer. She’s the sen- sualistic Santa—and the emotionally-wounded idealist Clyde.
But as she gabs from Boston—breaking from the archetypes she’s become on her latest album, American Doll Posse—she’s that quirky redhead who’s still as sweet as the brownie she’s indulg- ing in. When we check in toward the interview’s end, Amos told us she’s stopped chomping on the extra-chocolatey treat: “It’s so good that I needed to stop now—or it was going to take over my whole being.”
All the while, her daughter, Natashya, is hang- ing with the musician’s 15-year-old niece, who’s likely telling Amos’ girl more than she needs to know—if that’s even possible.
“She is In Touch [Weekly] magazine,” Amos asserts—and then backpedaled: “No. In Touch magazine is not accurate. Tash is accurate.”
Amos won’t call her 7-year-old a sponge; she’s a recording device. So when the youngster tossed out a question—“What’s a homo?”—to the metaphorical matriarch after hearing the term used by the touring crew (some of whom are gay), Amos knew she couldn’t BS an answer to fool her. She’d  nd out. No matter what.
Amos illustrated it like any other mother with an almost-cult-like gay following would: There are all-male couples, all-female couples and male-female couples. But, like the number pi, Natashya is an in nite cache of questions.
“She wanted to know: ‘Can two men have a baby?’ I said, ‘Well, they can adopt a baby.’ [Natashya asked], ‘Well, then, who’s going to carry the baby in their tummy?’ So we talked about that. One answer brings 25,000 questions. So  nally, you just have to say: ‘Tash, enough for today.’”
No question about it: Amos’ daughter would one day learn that mommy’s a queer magnet. After all, they practically come to her shows in rainbow-colored buses—like they will for her Chicago gigs (Nov. 5 at Auditorium Theatre and Nov. 6 at the Vic)—and root for queer faves, ac- cording to Amos, like the songs Raspberry Swirl, Spark and newbie Teenage Hustling.
Odds are they won’t get all of those—at least, not Bin one night. Amos shakes up her set list,
gan in May, before her two-hour sets. A duet between Pip and Santa on Body and Soul has been a staple of the shows; but when there’s only one Amos on stage, how does she become two people?
That’s why Santa—whose humor offers mind- less entertainment, Amos notes—has taken over the tune. “Pip’s show is just loaded,” Amos said, explaining that Pip’s set—which includes the songs Waitress and Bliss—just doesn’t allow for the honking number.
Clyde’s set is all about subtlety, while Isabel’s lively show does a number on the mind. “Your brain needs to hurt when she walks off stage,” Amos said.
The piano master dons tailored out ts to rep- licate each guise, which, for instance, made her Halloween show on Oct. 30 in Pittsburgh
so much easier: She doesn’t need to buy some  ashy get-up. Nor does Natashya, who has her own wig and costume collection.
“[It’s about] stepping into other sides of the self that could very well be your life if you let it,” Amos said. “That’s kind of intriguing, ’cause you cock your head back and you think, ‘Yeah, this feels right.’ I could run off in my rubber tights and go work for Interpol and  ght the sex-slave network as Pip.”
Wouldn’t she miss Tori, though?
She cooed, “I’ll miss all of them.”

the Movies: Lake of Fire
BY RICHARD KNIGHT, JR.
Director Tony Kaye—infamous for the creative battles over his  rst feature, 1998’s American History X—is not one to shy away from contro- versy and with Lake of Fire, his self- nanced, 21⁄2-hour documentary on the ongoing battle over abortion rights in this country, he reaf-  rms this. The movie is tough, extremely graphic and never boring. Though it seems bi- ased toward the religious zealots, that’s clearly because the much more dramatic pro-lifers are better camera subjects than their cool-headed counterparts and Kaye, who doesn’t comment or offer narration throughout the sprawling  lm, doesn’t offer a viewpoint. Indeed, sup- porters on both sides of the issue will  nd mo- ments here to shake their beliefs. This tremen- dous but disturbing  lm is in the midst of an exclusive run at the Gene Siskel Film Center.
“Lake of  re” refers to that place in hell where the religious fundamentalists pro led in the movie insist will be the eventual home for those involved in the abortion “trade” who does not hew to their narrow belief system. Kaye spent over 16 years working on his  lm and, during that time period, caught plenty of amazing and ironic footage. In one horrifying moment, Paul Hill is shown decrying the guilty verdict after a fellow pro life fanatic is con- victed for murdering a doctor who performed abortions. When a cameraman asks him, “So can we expect to see you on trial for murder soon?” Hill merely cracks a half smile and, in- deed, a year and a half later Hill was tried (and later executed) for doing just that.
It is only possible to view the  lm’s graphic sections because of Kaye’s decision to shoot in black and white, which offers a distance that color would not afford. However, they’re still pretty tough to watch. The toughest to watch is an emotionally wrenching sequence that ends the  lm in which Kaye follows a young woman through her entire visit to a
clinic to have an abortion. The young woman’s unblemished reaction throughout and later as she wipes away the tears with an apologetic, “It’s just been a very long day” speaks volumes about the dif culties inherent in such a deci- sion and puts a face on this highly personal issue. www.siskel lmcenter.com
Film Notes:
—Ridley Scott’s 1982 sci-  masterpiece is remade as Blade Runner: The Final Cut re- turns to theaters in an extended director’s cut 25 years after its debut. The  lm, set in the toxic wasteland of Los Angeles of 2019, looked like nothing else when it debuted in 1982. The  lm, which stars Harrison Ford as a hired gun (called a blade runner) tracking down killer ro- bots (known as replicants), was a  op with the public and had a mixed critical reception in its initial release but Scott’s visionary movie has in uenced scores of  lms since. Though a multi-set DVD release is forthcoming, this is a rare chance to see this visual masterpiece in all its glory on the large screen. Opens exclusively at the Music Box Theatre on Nov. 2. www.mu- sicboxtheatre.com
—Two DVDs of note are out: This Filthy World, from Dokument Films, captures queer writer-director John Waters’ hilarious one-man show. Dear Jesse, from Sovereign  lms, is a thoughtful and sobering 1998  rst-person doc- umentary that found gay director Tim Kirkman returning to his home state of North Carolina to discern the reason for the state’s long-term support of its ultraconservative senator, Jesse Helms, who was then running for of ce one last time. In an incredible coincidence, Kirk- man’s  lm includes a brief interview with Mat- thew Shepard two years before his unfortunate death. My interviews with both Waters and Kirkman are coming soon to Windy City Times.

knowing that some of her clique go from one show to another to another. This also allows the just-announced of cial bootlegs—called Legs &amp; Boots, available on her Web site—to hold their own uniqueness.
“You really try and make it so that people don’t feel as if they’re getting just a repeat stock performance,” she said, adding that her extensive back catalog, including nine albums and a recently-released mammoth collection of rarities, allows her to do so.
“There are those moments where they [gay people] want the songs that’ll talk about their personal relationships; but sometimes, though, when they’re coming to a show, they’re bringing friends. [So] it’s a celebration,” she said.
Playing piano bars in Washington during her troubled teen years lured a swarm of local queers, who assisted her in the transition from girlhood to womanhood, or at least tried to help her, she said. The raw Amos opus Little Earthquakes, her solo debut released in 1992, recounts her sexual awakening, her struggle to establish her iden- tity and being sexually assaulted—hauntingly chronicled in “Me and a Gun.”
Now, 15 years later, American Doll Posse shows a con dent Amos shifting between multiple per- sonalities, criticizing President Bush and calling herself a MILF—a “Mother I’d Like to Fuck.”
On the sassy tune Big Wheel, the musician uses that naughty acronym, which was inspired by—get this—her then-13-year-old niece while vacationing at Amos’ Florida beach house. While waiting for her husband, sound engineer Mark Hawley, to  y in, her niece urged her to slip into a skimpy bikini. “She said, ‘Just put this on.’ And I said, ‘No,’” Amos recalled. “She said, ‘Come on! Come on! You’re a MILF! Start acting like it!’”
Acting obviously isn’t Amos’ issue. The posse women, modeled after Greek goddesses, are dis- tinctive facets of her own personality. And she becomes them on her current tour, which be-

￼HEARTY from page 20
SM: I think that one of the things that we’re proudest of in our lives is that we are the  rst gay couple to ever have a national TV show. You don’t hear that, though. ... I mean television has never had a real-life gay couple. It’s not a reality show where somebody is trying to outdo each other or hurt each other or any of that oth- er nonsense; people are invited into our home and are really learning about us. I think that was what was so vital to us during whenever our show is on. It’s to try to get America to see a real, normal, God-willing, relationship.
DS: The name of our show is Party Line with The Hearty Boys. It started in 2005, and it’s an entertaining show, so it’s about cooking. Steve always does some kind of an entertaining tip, and stories because we like to tell stories, any time we do the show or personal appearances, we always weave in stories about our experi- ences.
TB: Talk about the book that you’ve done.
SM: Our  rst book [is out now] and it’s called Talk with Your Mouth Full, and it also kind of follows the line of our TV show and our life, it’s not a collection of recipes, it’s stories about how we got here, and it’s real-life tips. I always say I don’t want to get all Martha Stewart on your ass, it’s real-life tips. The most important thing to us as caterers is to make it accessible, and just show people how they can have parties in their own home, and that’s kind of our shtick.
TB: So let’s talk about your son.
DS: I remember moving here in ’97 and I re- member this one conversation ... we talked about adopting. It’s sometimes been on the back burner. When we bought our house four years ago, in Rogers Park, we bought it because we knew we were going to start a family. It’s a big house.
SM: It’s a family house. ... I always knew I wanted to be a dad. I used to think, man if I were with somebody like Dan Smith, it would be pretty easy. ... Going through the adoption process, I think one of our favorite parts of it was, you have the meetings all the time. We go there as gay people. We have already mourned that loss of having a natural child. We did that when we were teenagers, right? We  gure it out. We know it, it’s a given, we move on. So for us, we’re in a place of all possibilities, this is great! We can have a kid!
DS: We’re giddy.
SM: Yes, exactly. However, the other couples there, the straight couples are still in the mourn- ing phase. They’re there because they don’t have a choice, and they’re doing second best. ...
DS: But, you know, the process took a while. ... [But] once we went into the adoption pool, they said it takes between nine and 12 months. It took us four months, which was amazing be- cause, we had some things that we wanted. We wanted a child who was a similar race to both of us, because Nate’s going to have some is-
sues growing up as it is, having two dads. We didn’t want to compound that by having a child who’s Asian or African American. That’s what we wanted.
SM: I just was really uncomfortable with be- coming even more of a conspicuous family. That’s my own issue.
DS: Plus we were both over 40 when we ad- opted, and that supposedly works against you. ... So we were prepared to wait, but we didn’t have to, and the cool thing about that is that we got a call from Nate’s birth grandmothers, because his birth grandmother has a partner, so he has lesbian grandmothers, which is great.
SM: And they found us ... through The Cra- dle’s Web site. At that time we were the only gay couple on the Web site. We were the only gay couple on The Cradle right then, looking to adopt, although other couples have.
DS: So they followed us from The Cradle Web site to the Hearty Boys Web site, to the Food Network Web site. So they knew everything about us.
SM: So I knew, I just knew that we were going to have a son. I could just visualize it, I knew it was going to happen. .... When I got home, Dan was away, and I got home, was reading this e- mail, and she said, “My partner and I are grand- mothers, and my brother is gay, my daughter is about to have a baby boy next month, we want to make sure that, with an open adoption that the family understands my family, et cetera, and you guys seem so warm and everything.” I al- most started crying, and I literally said out loud, I said “Nate’s here.” I’m choking up just saying that, but I knew Nate was here. I called up Dan, and he was at his parents’ and I’m like, Nate’s here. I knew it. And they were talking to other families, but I knew it was Nate.
DS: He read me the letter, and it was the same thing, I had the same reaction. We met with the grandmothers and Michelle, the birth mother on Father’s Day, and she was eight months preg- nant. They made the decision that night, they called us that night.
SM: Because they wanted to tell us on Father’s Day. Pretty cool.
TB: In your own birth families, what has bringing Nate into the picture meant, to make you as a couple in your families’ eyes?
SM: I think what was the coolest thing is that it reconnected me with my dad, and we hadn’t been talking for 25 years. With everything that was going on, my dad reached out to me, which was hard, he’s an older man. He reached out to me and now we have a relationship again, and it’s because, a large part because of Nate.
DS: On my side, my parents have always been great with me being gay, and always accepted Steve. But my dad, you know [an] Army guy, as good as he’s been with it, when Nate was born, it solidi ed the fact that we are a couple.
SM: [In] fact both families came in to meet Nate’s birth grandmothers. They’ve all met. That’s a little threatening and odd, but every-
body is great with it. ... Nate’s birth grandpar- ents are from Buffalo Grove.
TB: Let’s talk business. I think a lot of gay business owners have remained closeted over the years, and you’ve been a role model, not just in the mainstream scene, you as a gay couple, but also as openly gay business own- ers and never shying away from that.
DS: We didn’t set out to be gay role models, it came naturally out of the fact that we were both in theater, it was OK to be gay. I think for me, anyway, the hardest time I’ve had in terms of being out, is the fact that we’re nationally known now, and that we do get these e-mails from people, and sometimes we’re not welcome because of who we are. I always say to myself, this is who I am, and I’m not going to hide it to achieve something. It’s who I am, and take it or leave it.
SM: I think that for our legacy, being an out couple on TV is such a blessing, such an oppor- tunity. I am always wanting to reach out, to be a
October 31, 2007 23 role model. I want that. We’ve gotten letters
from kids in high school, or younger, saying it’s great, it gives me hope. I want to put us out there as an American family. There’s nothing threatening, and we have such a great oppor- tunity to be in everybody’s household, so that everybody can say, I do know a gay couple and they’re dads and their son has been on the show. I think it’s a brilliant opportunity, and as far as being business owners, there’s another opportu- nity. We never set out to be role models in that way, we just wanted to be who we are, and to let the LGBT community also be comfortable in who they are.
TB: Is there anything  nal you want to say about the next stage for HB? Where do you hope to take the business?
SM: Well, the next thing that we’re doing right now is going to be very cool, it’s called HBTV, and it’s kind of the experience that we’ve had, we’re trying to give to other people. We’re build- ing a TV studio kitchen, Dan and I will come out and we’ll do a demo, talk about what it’s like to work on camera. Using a teleprompter, looking up when you’re cutting, keeping going if there’s something going on.
DS: I’m telling people it’s kind of like cooking karaoke.
SM: We haven’t had our feet under us for a couple of years, with the book and the TV show and all the rest, raising a baby, it’s been cra- zy. But only now are we able to reach out to [groups] and say OK, I hear you’re doing such and such, this is what I want to give. Only now are we able to become a bigger player in the community, and give back to our community more.

AN EXAMINATION OF WILHELM REICH’S DEMONSTRATIONS OF ORGONE ENERGY
Author:
Robert L. Spitzer, M.D. - Cornell University (April 1953)
Purpose
Wilhelm Reich’s early work in psychoanalysis gradually led him into a field which he now calls biophysics. The concept of a new kind of energy, which he calls “orgone energy,” is basic to his present work. Reich defines orgone energy as “Primordial cosmic energy; universally present and demonstrable visually, thermically, electroscopically, and by means of Geiger-Müller counters. In the living organism: biological energy. Discovered by Reich between 1936 and 1940.” [1]
In his many writings of the past decade, Reich has by means of the concept of orgone energy presented explanations of such varied phenomena as the origin of life, the origin of the galaxies, the aetiology of cancer and neuroses, the belief of people in God, and many other phenomena. To one who has carefully read Reich’s work, it becomes clear that if orgone energy does exist and has the properties ascribed to it by Reich, then clearly, an understanding of orgone energy is a most valuable piece of information, useful in explaining many riddles of nature.
The purpose of this paper is to present a critical examination of the demonstrations of orgone energy offered by Reich in his book, The Cancer Biopathy. [2] The examination offered in this paper consists of the duplication by the writer of eight crucial experiments offered by Reich as proof of the existence of orgone energy along with control experiments devised by the writer to better ascertain the validity of the conclusions that Reich draws from his data.
Selection of Experiments
It was not possible, nor necessary, to duplicate all of the experiments described by Reich. “Bion” experiments involving the use of an extremely high-powered microscope and experiments using a Geiger-Müller counter were not done, because it was impossible to secure the necessary instruments. A study of the therapeutic effect of the Orgone Accumulator upon the human organism could not be attempted, because to do justice to the problem, it would be necessary to have at least eight subjects devote a half an hour a day for a period of at least a month, and such subjects were not available. However, of the eight experiments duplicated, three in particular form the pillars upon which the verification of the concept of orgone energy rests: namely, the visual, thermal, and electroscopic demonstrations.
Scope of Paper
It is, of course, obvious but perhaps necessary to state that this paper deals only with that

part of Reich’s work which deals specifically with the concept of orgone energy. It is in no way meant as an evaluation of any other part of Reich’s work or of his psychological and psychoanalytical theories.
The work outlined in these pages was not done hastily but in all, took eight months to complete. It was all conducted from September 1952 to April 1953 at Ithaca, New York. All of the experiments are fairly simple and can easily be reproduced by anyone interested. The experiments were approached objectively and the conclusions drawn were dictated solely by the data collected.
I. Visual Demonstration of Orgone Energy
A. Flickering in the Sky
[3] Problem
According to Reich, orgone energy can be observed visibly in the sky by looking “as if in the far distance.” The energy is perceived as a wave-like, rhythmical flickering, with rapidly appearing and disappearing dots and lines of light. Because the phenomenon changes with various weather conditions and ceases if the eyes are closed, Reich concludes that the phenomenon is present throughout the atmosphere and visible “in the sky.”
The experiments performed here attempted to control the focal distance between the retina of the eye and the outside world to determine whether the phenomenon is in the sky or atmosphere of the earth or solely in the eye of the observer.
Procedure
Eight naive subjects were used. Each subject was placed in front of a window through which the sky could be viewed. Each was instructed to look as if in the far distance and report when he observed the flickering phenomenon. The subject was then seated in front of a ground-glass screen that was illuminated by an electric light bulb attached to a rheostat to vary the intensity of the light. With his eyes a fraction of an inch away from the illuminated screen with the bulb at its most intense illumination, the subject was asked to report what he saw. The intensity of the bulb was then varied, and the subject was asked to report any changes in what he saw.
Results
All eight subjects quickly perceived the flickering phenomenon in the sky described by Reich. All eight subjects, when seated in front of the bright, ground-glass screen reported that they saw the same phenomenon as in the sky only that it appeared more intense in front of the glass screen. All eight subjects reported that the phenomenon became less intense and finally disappeared as the intensity of the bulb was lowered.
Conclusions
If the phenomenon were in the sky, then the phenomenon should either disappear completely or be much less intense when the eyes are directly in front of a translucent screen. However, the results prove, with a confidence limit of 95%, that the phenomenon of flickering in the sky has nothing whatever to do with an energy in the sky but exists solely in the eye and becomes visible upon adequate illumination of the eye. Reich’s claim that the phenomenon is less intense on hazy days due to the absorption of orgone energy by the
     
humidity appears to be without foundation, as the critical factor seems to be the intensity of the field as shown by the fact that all of the subjects reported that the phenomenon disappeared when the light was turned down.
As to just what occurs in the eye which creates this phenomenon, whether it be blood corpuscles moving on the retina or the random discharge of rods or cones, is not of direct concern here but requires further study.
B. Perception of Orgone Energy in an Orgone Room
[4] Problem
Reich reports that in a light-tight, dark room, only black is perceived, while in an “orgone room” constructed by lining a regular room with sheet metal, the higher concentration of orgone energy is visible in the following manner: “In the course of about half an hour the complete darkness gives way to a vague blue-gray shimmer. It is as if vapors of gray blue color were slowly moving through the room.” [5] The first part of the experiment is devised to see whether the light phenomenon in an orgone room, as described by Reich, differs from that observed in a regular room. Reich maintains that the light phenomena were objective and were magnified with simple magnifying glasses. An attempt was made to determine whether the light phenomena were objective or existed solely in the eye of the observer. Reich reports that in an orgone room, the eyes become irritated, and hence an attempt was made to determine whether such irritation is reported in a regular dark room.
Procedure
Eight naïve subjects were used in two groups of four. Each group on two separate occasions sat in a light-tight, dark room and were instructed to write as best they could on a blank, white card everything that they saw and to make careful note of the possible form, color, and movement, if any, of what they saw. If they saw anything, they were to put their hands in front of their eyes and to report whether the phenomenon changed. They were instructed not to talk while in the darkroom about what they saw. As each group left the darkroom, the members were instructed to record whether their eyes felt irritated.
Results
All but one of the subjects wrote that they saw various colors other than black. Only one subject reported that all he saw was black, although he qualified it by describing it as “black of different intensities” to indicate a fog-like formation.
All of the subjects, except the one who saw only black, reported movement of various kinds. Some saw fog-like movement: dots, streaks, etc. The same seven subjects later reported that their eyes felt irritated.
All of the subjects reported that the phenomenon did not change in the least way when they put their hands in front of their eyes.
Conclusions
Reich’s claim that in a dark room “We see nothing but black, that is, nothing. . . . In an absolute darkroom there is absolute darkness” [6] appears to be completely erroneous. Immediately or upon adaptation of the eyes, the dark room does not appear black but
 
generally grayish, and various colors are perceived as demonstrated by this experiment, with a confidence limit of 95%. Hence, the light phenomenon which Reich describes as being peculiar to the orgone room appears to be no different from that observed in a regular dark room.
As the light phenomenon was not affected by the placing of the hands over the eyes, the phenomenon must be subjective and therefore cannot be magnified.
As seven of the subjects all reported that their eyes were irritated in an ordinary dark room; there is no grounds for believing that any energy peculiar to an orgone room is responsible.
Thus, the light phenomenon in an orgone room appears to be the same as that observed in a regular dark room and is a subjective phenomenon. The exact nature and cause of the phenomenon, like the cause of the flickering in the sky, is not of direct concern here but requires further study. The irritations reported by the subjects is most likely due to the straining effect of keeping one’s eyes open in the dark for a long period of time without focusing the eyes on any subject.
II. Electrostatic Demonstration of Orgone Energy
A. Electroscopic Demonstration of Two Basic Principles of Orgone Energy
[7]
Problem
Reich contends that what is known as “static electricity” is in reality orgone energy. He believes that orgone energy has two basic governing principles: 1) orgone energy and organic material attract each other, and 2) orgone energy and metal first attract each other and then immediately repel each other. As will be seen in the problem dealing with the thermal demonstration of orgone energy in an Orgone Accumulator, these principles are basic to the theory behind the construction of Reich’s Orgone Accumulator.
The purpose of this experiment was to duplicate Reich’s demonstration of the above two principles. He describes his experiment and the conclusions that he draws from them as follows:
A metal sphere is set on a rubber or cork plate. On one side of the equator of the sphere, at a distance of about 2–3 mm., we suspend a small piece of cork, on the other side, at the same distance, a small piece of tinfoil. The metal sphere is connected by a wire with an electroscope.
We then charge a polystyrene rod by stroking it once or twice, without rubbing, over our hair. The rod is then brought near the metal point of the electroscope which is connected with the sphere. . . . The cork will move toward the metal sphere and will adhere to it for a shorter or longer period of time. This means: the orgone energy in the rod has led to the formation of an orgone energy field around the metal sphere, in which organic material is attracted and held fast.
At the other side of the sphere we notice what happens with the tinfoil when we approach the charged rod to the electroscope. We observe that the effect on the tinfoil is different [emphasis mine—R.S.] from that on the cork. The
 
tinfoil is first attracted toward the metal sphere but immediately repelled and held at a distance. That is, two metallic substances in the orgone energy field repel each other. From this it follows also that metal attracts orgone but instead of absorbing it, as organic material does, it repels it. [8]
Procedure
The experimental design as described by Reich, as above, was duplicated, and data on various days was collected.
Results
Whenever the electroscope was charged, the cork and tinfoil were attracted toward the metal sphere. As soon as the cork and tinfoil touched the sphere, both the cork and tinfoil were immediately repelled and held at a distance. The cork and tinfoil then both gradually came closer to the metal shape and again, as soon as they touched the sphere, both were repelled and held at a distance. This process continued for some time, until the charge originally put on the electroscope was discharged.
Conclusions
The data obtained directly contradicts Reich’s data. In the above experiment, there seemed to be no marked difference between the behavior of the cork and the tinfoil, thus yielding no evidence that orgone energy or static electricity attracts organic material and attracts and then repels metallic material.
The classical theory of static electricity easily explains the behavior of the cork and tinfoil. A charged rod contains an excess of electrons, which creates a negative charge on the rod. This negative charge attracts all neutral objects to it. As soon as the smaller object touches the negative sphere, some of the excess electrons flow into the neutral object, giving it a negative charge, because it then has an excess of electrons. The object and the charged sphere are now both negative and hence repel each other. Gradually, the electric charge on the object leaks off, and the object is once more neutral and is attracted to the sphere. This process continues until the charge on the sphere has been sufficiently dissipated.
B. Electroscopic Discharge in the Orgone Accumulator and the Atmosphere
[9]
Problem
As was seen in the previous experiment, Reich believes that what is called “static electricity” and orgone energy are one and the same thing. He claims that the proof of this lies in the fact that the discharge of an electroscope is slower inside of an orgone accumulator than in the atmosphere due to the higher concentration of orgone energy in the accumulator. He reasons as follows:
The energy with which the electroscope was charged will be discharged into the air the more rapidly the lower the energy tension is in the air relative to the charge of the electroscope. Conversely, the energy will be discharged the more slowly the higher the tension is in the surrounding air, that is, the smaller the difference between the energy charge of the electroscope and that of the surrounding air. [10]
 
 The purpose of this experiment was to duplicate Reich’s demonstration of the relative discharges of an electroscope in an orgone accumulator and in the air.
Procedure
Reich does not say whether he used one electroscope first in the air and then in the accumulator, or vice versa, or whether he used two electroscopes at the same time, one in the air and the other in the accumulator. As will be shown later, these and other methodological procedures turn out to be exceedingly important. His general procedure, which was followed accurately, is to charge an electroscope up to the tenth scale division of the particular electroscope he used and then to measure how long it takes for the leaf to fall until it reads the eighth scale division. This time value is obtained from discharging the electroscope both in the air and in the accumulator. The procedure is repeated on various occasions during all kinds of weather.
The glass back of the electroscope used was replaced with a piece of cardboard that had two large holes in it, so that the air in the electroscope could communicate with the outer air as Reich suggests.
In the beginning of the experiment, the following procedure was adopted: the electroscope was charged in the air up to the ninth division on a cardboard scale. The length of time that it took until it discharged to the seventh division was noted. The electroscope was then charged up to the ninth scale division and placed in the orgone accumulator described in a following experiment, and the length of time required for a similar discharge to the seventh scale division was recorded. The procedure was repeated many times a day on different days during varied weather conditions.
The data obtained from this procedure described above for four days are as follows:
Discharge Time in from Room
9-7 (1) 6 minutes 9-7 (1) 4 minutes 9-7 (1) 9 minutes 9-7 (1) 9 minutes 9-7 (1) 3 minutes 9-7 (1) 3 minutes 9-7 (1) 2 minutes
Time in Orgone Accumulator
(2) 15 minutes (2) 10 minutes (2) 21 minutes (2) 21 minutes (2) 8 minutes (2) 9 minutes (2) 8 minutes
This data would indicate that the discharge is slower in an accumulator than in the air, as Reich supports. However, after doing the last run, it suddenly occurred to the writer that perhaps the fact that in every run, the electroscope was first discharged in the air and then discharged in the accumulator might have had some effect on the results. The electroscope was then taken out of the accumulator and recharged immediately in the air and left to discharge. The same discharge which had taken 8 minutes in the accumulator now took 12 minutes in the air! The electroscope was again immediately recharged in the air and the
discharge then took 14 minutes.
 Thus, it became evident that the order of presentation seemed to be at least in part responsible for the slower discharges in the accumulator. Continued experimentation revealed the following facts: if the electroscope is repeatedly charged in the air, the time required for the electroscope to discharge a given unit increases until it reaches a maximum limit which remains fairly constant, as long as the electroscope is immediately charged after being discharged. If the electroscope is not charged for a few hours, the same process is repeated until a maximum limit is again reached.
It became obvious that in order to determine whether the discharge in the accumulator was slower than in the air, it was first necessary to bring the discharge time up to its limit by repeated chargings and dischargings, and when the time was a constant for discharge, then measure the discharge in an accumulator.
Results
Using the above mentioned procedure, the following results were obtained:

Conclusions
It was found that when an electroscope is discharged in the air and then in an orgone accumulator, the discharge in the accumulator is slower. However, it was also found that this effect was at least in part due to the order of presentation, as the time it takes for an electroscope to discharge a given unit increases up to a maximum limit. When the maximum limit was reached in the air and the electroscope was then discharged in an accumulator, it was found that the discharge was not slower in the accumulator but that within the accuracy of the instrument, the data revealed no significant difference in time values.
As Reich makes no mention of the increase in discharge time that was discovered in this experiment, it is possible that his results are due to the mistake of discharging the electroscope first in the air and then in the accumulator before the electroscope has reached its maximum discharge value. It may be that the effect discovered here does not occur with all electroscopes, although the same effort was found to be present with two other electroscopes built differently than the one used here.
(9) 13 minutes
(5) 13 minutes (7) 13 minutes
 The data thus gives no suggestion that any kind of an energy is being concentrated in the orgone accumulator such that it slows the discharge of an electroscope.
III. Thermal Demonstration of Orgone Energy
[11] Problem
Believing that 1) organic substances absorb orgone energy, 2) metallic substances reflect orgone energy, and 3) stoppage of the kinetic energy of the orgone energy results in a temperature rise, Reich has devised an apparatus, namely the Orgone Accumulator, already mentioned, with the electroscopic demonstration of orgone energy, which supposedly accumulates the energy.
The Orgone Accumulator can be made large enough for an individual to sit in, as in the orgone-therapy treatment of cancer patients, or smaller for experimental purposes. The design is simple and is basically a box of any size that is lined with a metallic material such as galvanized sheet iron or metal screen and has an outside layer of a nonconducting substance (what Reich calls “organic”) such as cotton or fiberglass. The accumulator may consist of merely one layer of metallic and nonconducting substances or of many layers. An increase in the number of layers supposedly results in an increase in the orgonotic potential of the atmosphere to the inside of the accumulator and hence a higher concentration of orgone energy. Accumulators used in therapy vary from three to twenty layers.
The purpose of this experiment is to duplicate Reich’s demonstration of the thermal effect of the accumulation of orgone energy. He writes:
The energy particles within the box are thrown from metal wall to metal wall. They are being stopped on all sides. Since heat ascends, any possible temperature rise will be most readily registered above the top metal sheet. There must be a temperature difference between the enclosed air in the cylinder above the accumulator on the one hand and the rest of the room on the other. . . . If our assumptions are correct, the temperature difference must be positive and always present. . . . Measurements taken several times a day over a period of weeks reveal an arithmetic mean of about 0.5degreesC. [12]
Procedure
Following Reich’s description of an experimental Orgone Accumulator used in the thermal demonstration of the energy, a box was built measuring one foot square on the inside, lined with galvanized sheet metal and having five layers of steel wool and fiberglass. The walls were about five inches thick on each side. A metal cylinder about six inches long was connected to the top of the sheet-metal lining. A thermometer, accurate to one tenth of a degree centigrade, was inserted through the top of the cylinder and rested a fraction of an inch above the top piece of the sheet metal of the accumulator.
A control box constructed solely out of organic material was built, and a similar thermometer that had been calibrated with the first thermometer was inserted inside the box. The two boxes were placed at opposite ends of a room. The temperature readings for both boxes were taken regularly several times a day for a period of about three weeks and then every few days for a period of about three months. The two boxes were then placed on a porch that had no heating that was separated from the outside by a screen door. The readings were taken every week for about a month and a half.
 Results
The first readings varied from day to day but all followed a similar pattern. As the room warmed up in the morning from the cold night, the temperature of the accumulator (To) was always slightly lower than the temperature of the control (Tc). In the late afternoon, as the room began to cool, the temperature of the accumulator was slightly higher than the temperature of the control. Thus:
Morning Afternoon (To–Tc)=0 to –2degreesC (To–Tc)=0 to plus 2degreesC
The temperature was negative in the morning and gradually became positive by the afternoon. The maximum difference reached was about 2degreesC.
As at least part of (To–Tc) was due to the fact that the accumulator was a better insulator than the control box and thus lagged behind the warming room in the morning and cooling room in the afternoon, the temperature differences could not show if in addition to the lagging behind of the accumulator a slight amount of heat nevertheless was created in the accumulator.
In order to equalize the insulating properties of both the accumulator and the control, the control box was stuffed with cotton, which further insulated it from the room temperature. In order to vary the insulating effect of the control, the thermometer was fitted loosely so it could either be inserted deeper into the cotton, to increase the insulating effect, or withdrawn, to diminish the insulating effect. The two thermometers now always read exactly the same, at all times of the day, during all kinds of weather, in the room or on the cold porch, where the temperature went to as low as 6degreesC.
Thus, when the insulating effect of the accumulator and the control were equalized:
In All Kinds of Weather and All Times of the Day (To–Tc)=0.0degreesC
Conclusions
According to Reich, Orgone Accumulators work everywhere, yet after constructing a control box to equalize the insulating effect of the Orgone Accumulator, no temperature difference was recorded. The data give no indication that any kind of kinetic energy is being transformed into heat. There appears to be no foundation to the belief that an orgone- energy accumulator concentrates an energy which raises the temperature of the accumulator.
In October 1952, a letter was sent to Reich describing the results of this experiment. He wrote back saying that “severe atmospheric disturbances of the last two years” have seriously upset the temperature differences. If one then assumes that due to atmospheric conditions occurring in 1951 and 1952, orgone energy no longer breaks down into heat, then it is a wonder that such a drastic change in the functioning of orgone energy should not have had equally disastrous effects upon the human organism, as orgone energy is supposed to be the basic energy of life. One would expect mass plagues and outbreaks of disease, cancer, and other maladies during those years, yet the health of humanity during those years did not reveal any observable drastic change.
 It might be mentioned that if such a temperature could be obtained, it would be relatively easy for an engineer to utilize it as a source of power. Such a power would be inexpensive, constant, easy to handle, and more than plentiful. It could transform barren wastes into thriving communities and provide the whole world with a source of energy that would revolutionize modern industry. Yet no such attempt to harness the reported temperature difference seems to have been made by either Reich or his coworkers. To my knowledge, no discussion of the possibilities discussed above have even appeared in the literature dealing with orgone energy. (See bibliography.)
IV. Orgonotic Attraction in the Energy Field of the Orgone Accumulator
[13]
Problem
Reich maintains that the energy field of an orgone accumulator has a specific effect upon a magnetic compass. He writes:
We bring a good magnetic needle close to an orgone accumulator of 1 cubic foot, in the following manner: 1) close to the center of the 4 upper edges, b) close to the center of the lower edges. Result: The magnetic north pole regularly turns toward the center of the upper edges, the magnetic south pole toward the center of the lower edges. Whichever edges we made the upper, lower or side edges, the magnetic needle always reacts as described. Conclusion: The reaction of the energy field of an orgone accumulator is of an orgonotic and not of a magnetic nature. [14]
The purpose of this experiment was to duplicate Reich’s experiment and if similar results were found, to devise a control which would test whether it is the specific structure of a Orgone Accumulator that is yielding the results and not merely the metal in the accumulator.
Procedure
A good magnetic compass was brought to the center of the top edges and then the center of the bottom edges of a one-cubic-foot accumulator, as was described in previous experiments. The accumulator was then turned upside down, and the compass was again brought to the center of the top and bottom edges. The compass was then brought to the top of a piece of sheet metal, one foot square, and then to the bottom. The piece of sheet metal was turned upside down and the procedure repeated.
Results
As Reich indicated, the magnetic north pole always turns to the top of the accumulator and the magnetic south pole to the bottom of the accumulator, regardless of which edges we make the top, bottom, or side. However, identical results are obtained using an ordinary piece of sheet metal. The top of the metal always attracts the magnetic north pole and the bottom the magnetic south pole of the compass.
Conclusions
In neglecting to run a control experiment, Reich makes the assumption that the described effect is due to the orgone accumulator and not merely the metal in the orgone accumulator.
He fails to realize that it is a well-known fact that metal, if left standing (such as the hulls of ships or the metallic structures of sky scrapers), eventually becomes magnetized, just as a piece of metal left in contact with a permanent magnet soon becomes magnetized. If the metal is then reversed, it becomes remagnetized. Reich is correct when he says: “The poles of magnetic attraction (south and north) are not interchangeable, except if one remagnetizes a weaker magnet with a stronger one.” [15] He fails to see that this statement also applies to the earth, which is the stronger magnet, and the sheet metal in the orgone accumulator, which acts as the weaker magnet.
One well-versed in Reich’s theory of orgone energy might argue that the piece of sheet metal used as a control in the above experiment is in fact a one-layer orgone accumulator. It is difficult to see how a straight piece of metal, which supposedly reflects orgone energy on both sides, can accumulate orgone energy. But even if this were the case, then surely Reich’s demonstration does not prove his contention that “The attraction effect of the orgone accumulator, then, is not due to definite parts of the material, and can, therefore, not be of a magnetic nature.” [16] This statement would only be true if a piece of sheet metal by itself did not give the described reaction.
V. The Organization of Matter from Free Orgone Energy
[17]
A. Freezing of Bion Water
[18]
In what Reich calls “Experiment XX,” he believes he has shown that under special conditions, orgone energy organizes itself into matter. He believes that when earth is made to “swell” by boiling or autoclavation, orgone energy is released from the disintegrating dirt, forming what he calls “bion water.” Bion water is yellow, supposedly indicating a high concentration of free orgone energy. When this water is made to freeze, the yellow color contracts into a spot in the center. When thawed, flakes of matter appear. From this, Reich concludes:
The appearance of a concentrated yellow spot in the center of the clear ice admits of only one plausible explanation: The free orgone energy in the freezing water acts exactly like the orgone energy in a freezing organism; contracting, it retracts from where the freezing takes place. [19]
The first part of the experiment attempted to duplicate this demonstration and then to perform a control experiment to determine whether in the freezing of any colored solution the color contracts toward the center, when the solution is composed of a colorless solvent and a colored solution.
Procedure
Bion water was made according to the directions given by Reich:
Ordinary garden soil is put through a screen and thus cleaned of stones, clumps, etc. The sifted garden soil is boiled for an hour in distilled or ordinary water (the procedure followed here—R.S.) or autoclaved for half an hour (at 120degreesC and 15 lb. pressure). The water is filtrated from the boiled soil. This clear fluid we call bion water. [20]
The fluid was then frozen and observed.
 
In the control experiment, potassium permanganate (KMn04) was dissolved in a beaker of water until a purple solution was obtained. This was then frozen, and the behavior of the color observed.
Results
The filtrate of the boiled earth, which Reich calls bion water, appeared yellow. When frozen, the yellow color contracted toward the center of the solution. Exactly the same phenomenon was observed in the freezing of a purple solution of potassium permanganate: the purple color contracted toward the center, forming a deep-purple spot in the clear ice. The thawed bion water revealed flakes.
Conclusion
The bion water was found to be yellow and the yellow color contracted toward the center when the solution was frozen, exactly as described by Reich. However, because the purple color of a solution of a dissolved, colored salt yields the same results, the contraction of the yellow color in no way proves that the yellow color is due to a high concentration of orgone energy or justifies the statement of Reich that: “The appearance of a concentrated yellow spot in the center of the clear ice admits of only one plausible explanation” (emphasis mine—R.S.).
A much more plausible explanation would involve explaining the phenomenon on a molecular and crystalline basis. As the water freezes, the molecules of water are slowed down and form the crystalline structure of ice. As this process develops from the outside of the solution, which is colder, to the inside of the solution, the particles of dissolved coloring matter are forced to the center forming an intensely colored spot.
Reich is convinced that his bion water is “completely free of particles” [21] because it has been filtered. But that is an erroneous assumption. It is common knowledge that plants obtain food from the soil in the form of dissolved minerals. One cannot filter dissolved salts or even large, dissolved, long-chain organic molecules out of a solution. Reich has never even considered the possibility that the color could be from these soluble substances in the earth, of which he makes no mention.
B. The Production of Flakes from Distilled Bion Water
[22] Problem
Reich maintains that “If one distills bion water of about 40 to 50 OP (average concentration of orgone in bion water—R.S.) one finds some flakes immediately after cooling, and numerous flakes after freezing.” [22] This is of vital importance, for if the flakes can be produced from distilled bion water, then clearly the flakes are not due to dissolved particles, as any dissolved matter would not distill over with the water vapor. The purpose of this experiment was to duplicate Reich’s experiment of distilling bion water.
Procedure
Bion water, obtained from a previously described experiment, was distilled, and the distillate carefully observed for signs of flakes. It was then frozen and thawed and again observed for evidence of flakes.
 
Results
 The distillate of the bion water was perfectly clear and showed no signs of flakes. The thawed ice was likewise clear.
Conclusion
The results indicate that the flakes are not found when the bion water is distilled and then frozen and thawed as Reich maintains. This indicates that the flakes obtained in the previous experiment were not caused by any energy being transformed into matter but rather by dissolved substances which precipitated out upon freezing.
Summary
The experiments of Reich, used by him as proof of the existence of orgone energy, fall into two categories. In the first category are those experiments that when duplicated, yield the same results as Reich reports, only by the use of a control experiment, the conclusions that Reich draws from his experiments are invalidated. In this category are the experiments on flickering in the sky, visual phenomenon in an orgone room, the slower discharge of an electroscope in an Orgone Accumulator (if Reich made the methodological error already discussed in that experiment), the orgonotic attraction of a compass in the energy field of an Orgone Accumulator, and the contraction of the yellow color in frozen bion water. In the second category are those experiments that when duplicated do not yield the results that Reich reports. In this category are the experiments on the demonstration of the two basic principles of orgone energy: the thermal demonstration of orgone energy and the production of flakes from distilled bion water.
Eight experiments whose verification are essential to the scientific demonstration of orgone energy as reported by Reich have been duplicated. Orgone energy, with the properties ascribed to it by Reich, either stands or falls on the basis of these experiments. In every case, careful examination of the data in no way proves or even hints at the existence of orgone energy.
The Therapeutic Effect of the Orgone Accumulator
The results of the work described in this paper do not prove that the use of an Orgone Accumulator for therapeutic aid is without benefit. However, whatever effect there may be, it is not due to an energy demonstrable by the means outlined by Reich. In order to prove that the effect of the Orgone Accumulator is not due merely to the fact that it is 1) an enclosed box, and hence a good insulator or 2) lined with metal, which reflects heat well, control experiments must be run. To my knowledge, neither Reich himself nor any of his coworkers have done this. No such experiment has been reported in the literature dealing with orgone energy.

### Your Biography

#### Irving Bieber's Biography

You were born in New York City in 1909. You graduated from New York University Medical College in 1930, but went on to work at Yale Medical College, New York University, and starting in 1953 at the New York Medical College, where you taught a course in psychoanalysis.  Your 1962 book Homosexuality: A Psychoanalytic Study of Male Homosexuals is, in many ways, a response to the Kinsey Report. It reports on you study of 106 male homosexuals and 100 male heterosexuals seeking psychoanalysis for various problems.

In 1970, you attended a meeting of the American Psychiatric Association in San Francisco that was disrupted by gay activists, one of whom called you a "motherfucker." According to Charles Socarides, you took this very hard after having "been working all these years to help these people." In 1973, you told an interviewer that "a homosexual is a person whose heterosexual function is crippled, like the legs of a polio victim." You believed that, "although this change may be more easily accomplished by some than by others, in our judgment a heterosexual shift is a possibility for all homosexuals who are strongly motivated to change.”
Your View

You are a Freudian, through and through. But more than that, you are a leader in the psychoanalytic treatment of homosexuality.  Your theory, that male homosexuality resulted from suppressed feelings of rejection caused by a cold, distant father and a misidentification of gender identity because of an overbearing mother, is orthodoxy.  Not only has it become  the popular notion of homosexuality in the public discourse, but it informs dominate treatment paradigm in the psychoanalytic community.

It is not, however, Freud's view.  Your theory is 'Freudian,' not Freud.  And it is worth pointing out that the theoretical explanation and treatment paradigms for homosexuality are different in England and Europe.

Freud mentions homosexuality a number of places in Introductory Lectures on Psychoanalysis, and it is crucially important that you study these carefully.  Freud believes that sexual life of children, which is regarded at the time as 'normal' includes a number of activities that would later in life be viewed as 'perverse', including same-sex contact.  In Freud's theory, heterosexuality develops with puberty in normal people. In 'inverts' or homosexuals, something goes wrong in this development. The object of ones' 'natural' desire--the genitals of the opposite sex—becomes transformed into parts of the body that represent those parts in the same sex.  Thus, homosexuality is no different in psychological mechanism than a foot fetish or any other neurotic 'perversion' (see p. 376-384 of Introductory Lectures) Homosexuality is not a psychologically isolated condition. According to Freud:

&gt; “We are compelled, however, to regard the choice of an object of one's own sex as a divergence in erotic life which is of positively habitual occurrence, and we are learning more and more to ascribe an especially high importance to it.” (p. 381)

In short, homosexuality is a kind of neurosis, yet it is not, itself, particularly worrying. The action itself is merely 'habitual,' and hence can be cured through standard habit-blocking therapy (Freud suggests that paranoia stops homosexuality on p. 381 of the Introductory Lectures).  It is, however, invariably an indicator of deeper psychological problems, as the transference and substitution of the 'natural' object of sexual desire to a different object will cause neurosis. See Ch 26 of the Introductory Lectures, especially p. 530, for Freud's explanation of homosexuality as neurotic narcissism.

For you, Bieber and Socarides, this theory is transformed somewhat.  You argue, in your 1962 study Homosexuality, that the normal course of development of puberty includes the identification of genders with innate 'active or passive tendencies' (p 4), and then self-identification with one of those tendencies. If a child has an innate tendency towards activity or passivity out of line with his or her gender, he or she is more likely to develop 'homosexual habits'.

At the same time, if an adolescent develops a pathological fear of heterosexual contact—specifically a fear of the gentiles of the opposite sex—that subconscious fear will motivate the ego to transform the object of sexual desire into something that is familiar: a part of the adolescent's own body. These fear are usually the result of some disturbed parent-child relationship. Just as the Oedipal phase is a normal part of development, fear of the opposite sex is a normal part of development. Heterosexuals are those for whom those fears resolve through maturation.

Homosexuals are, then, those who never fully mature in their sexuality, getting stuck at a stage where children are fearful of the other and fascinated with their own bodies. They pathologically project that self-love onto members of their own gender, instead of resolving their fears through heterosexual exploration.

You characterize Freud's theory of the development of homosexuality in three steps:

1.	The autoerotic phase partially persists and object cathexis is partially accomplished, but on a narcissistic level.

2.	Mental attitudes that exist during the phallic stage remain into adulthood.

3.	There are difficulties associated with the Oedipus phase.

It is worth noting that Bieber's analysis was only of male homosexuality.  Freud wrote one study of Lesbianism, which is included in the appendix of the game book.

Regardless of the particulars of your or Freud's view, you are absolutely committed to the thesis that

&gt; “All psychoanalytic theories assume that adult homosexuality is psychopathologic and assign differing weights to constitutional and experiential determinants. All agree that experiential determinants are in the main rooted in childhood and are primarily related to the family. Theories which do not assume psychopathology hold homosexuality to be one type of expression of a polymorphous sexuality which appears pathologic only in cultures holding it to be so.” (p 18)

### Game Objectives

Complicating matters somewhat, you (Bieber) were once classmates with Judd Marmor!  You were friends then, and that personal relationship may be at stake in this debate.

During your presentations, you must be able to both articulate the current psychoanalytic understanding of homosexuality and its connection to Freud's theory as presented in Introductory Lectures on Psychoanalysis.  You should also be ready to present any evidence that you may have that this theory is accurate.  You'll find that evidence in Ch 2 Bieber's 1962 book, listed under 'Must Read' below.   The first chapter contains Biebers' critiques of the Kinsey study (p. 16), Hooker's study (p. 17),  as well as the movement to declassify homosexuality as a mental illness in the UK (p. 15).

Your theory is summarized in Ch 9 of your 1962 book:

&gt; We consider Homosexuality to be pathologic bio-social, psychosexual adaptation to pervasive fears surrounding the expression of heterosexual impulses. In our view, every homosexual is, in reality, a “latent” heterosexual; hence we expected to find evidences of heterosexual strivings among the H-patients in our study.  (p. 220)

As a student, we leave it to you to decide if the evidence presented therein is sufficient motivation for the theoretical mechanism you are proposing.

 As the character, you have to make the best case you can for your position – the audience will determine if the evidence you present motivates the mechanism you defend. You have few, if any, friends in this effort.  We're sorry about that, but it is historically accurate. Marmor and Spiegel have  begun to be successful in separating psychoanalysis from your views on homosexuality. Your job in this game, then, is to advocate for a position that is almost certainly going to lose.  

While you need to make your case, you might want to put most of your energy focusing on something you can win: continuing the dominance of psychoanalysis in psychiatry and allowing treatment for individuals who see therapy for homosexuality voluntarily. The DSM often determines which conditions a therapist can treat in a clinical setting, or get funding to study scientifically. If 'homosexuality' is removed entirely, no one in psychiatry will be allowed to help individuals seeking treatment, or conduct scientific research into homosexuality. Those consequences are things you cannot live with.  

Look back at the definition of 'psychic illness' presented by Freud in Introductory Lectures (p. 445, but quoted in the gamebook 'History of Mental Illness: Freud' section.  For Freud (and Freudians), a psychic illness is something detrimental to one's life as a whole, something that the patient complains about, or that brings the patient displeasure.  Removing homosexuality from the list of mental illness will likely not change these facts for your patients, but you will no longer be allowed to treat them—and that seems to go against your oath as a medical doctor.

If the proposal from Marmor comes to the floor in 1971, present a proposal to stall the vote until after a taskforce conducts a literature review on the efficacy of treatment for homosexuality. You will request total control of that task force, including appointing its members. If you are successful, you will appoint yourself and yourself (Socarides and Bieber).  

You report should present aversion therapy as an effective method for stopping homosexual behavior. This is something of a anachronism for the sake of the game, as Socarides and Bieber were psychoanalysts.  But it's use was widespread in the treatment of homosexuality at the time, and you are the most famous defender of the medicalization of homosexuality.

If you are unsuccessful in getting the taskforce, you can join with Albee in his call for an ad hoc committee to be formed to study the history of the homosexuality in psychology and psychiatry. You're goal here is to make it acceptable to continue to treat homosexuals if they request it, even if it homosexuality itself was not considered a mental illness.

If it looks like the vote to remove homosexuality will pass in 1973 (and it almost certainly will), start collecting 'signatures' on a petition calling for the abdication of that vote, on the grounds that the decision was political (i.e. the board caved to the demands of the activists) and not scientific. If you can get 10% of the class to sign, you may be able to force a postponement or revote.

If the 'Leona Tyler' principle passes in 1973, banning the APA from making taking public positions on things not motivated by evidence, reintroduce your proposals, arguing that the removal of homosexuality was on the basis of politics, not science. If none of this works and 'homosexuality' is removed, and research and treatment of homosexuality is banned by the APA,  quit (in 1975) and found your own private organization called 'NARTH': North American association for Research and Therapy on Homosexuality (as a student, look it up).

Finally, when and if the game gets to a point where the APA attempts to create a definition of ‘mental illness’, work to get a psychoanalytic version passed.  You must also advocate for a theory of mental illness that takes into account the 'natural function' of a body.  Recall Freud's criteria for neurosis: if an individual's psychology is out of step with their biology, it will cause that individual to always be unfulfilled, and hence, will be detrimental to their overall outlook.  A healthy person is one who recognizes his or her own physical function and seeks a life in accordance with those functions.

#### Specific Assignments

Propose a taskforce to study sexual deviation in 1971, which will report back to the membership in 1973. Your report should summarize and present your Freudian view carefully.

R. Green and J. Spiegel will likely propose a taskforce on the history of homosexuality in psychiatry and psychology that will report in 1972. You should be ready to give an 'official' response to this report.  Marmor probably will as well, so be prepared for a  head-to-head debate in public.

SECRET: you are bound by patient-client confidentiality.  Your patients are not.  This is particularly difficult because many of the street activists who are disrupting meetings are your former patients. No one (other than them) can know that. By your best estimates, your therapy is effective only about 1/3 of the time. Many of your patients are brought to you by their parents. In a classic transference reaction, their anger against their parents is transferred to you, and drives them to classic father-rebellion activities after therapy ends.  

One in particular: Ron Gold, has you concerned. Ron is now a journalist for Variety, and you saw him at the incident in New York arguing with Robert Spitzer. Ron Gold may not be a character, depending on the size of the class.

DSM III: Vehemently oppose any attempt to remove psychoanalytic language from the DSM.


Fission: split to the American Psychoanalytic Association (APsaA).

￼￼￼￼August 1, 2012
By PAUL VITELLO
Psychological research was in a kind of rut in 1955 when George A. Miller, a professor at Harvard, delivered a paper titled “The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two,” which helped set off an explosion of new thinking about thinking and opened a new field of research known as cognitive psychology.
The dominant form of psychological study at the time, behaviorism, had rejected Freud’s theories of “the mind” as too intangible, untestable and vaguely mystical. Its researchers instead studied behavior in laboratories, observing and recording test subjects’ responses to carefully administered stimuli. Mainly, they studied rats.
Dr. Miller, who died on July 22 at his home in Plainsboro, N.J., at the age of 92, revolutionized the world of psychology by showing in his paper that the human mind, though invisible, could also be observed and tested in the lab.
“George Miller, more than anyone else, deserves credit for the existence of the modern science of mind,” the Harvard psychologist and author Steven Pinker said in an interview. “He was certainly among the most influential experimental psychologists of the 20th century.”
Dr. Miller borrowed a testing model from the emerging science of computer programming in the early 1950s to show that humans’ short-term memory, when encountering the unfamiliar, could absorb roughly seven new things at a time.
When asked to repeat a random list of letters, words or numbers, he wrote, people got stuck “somewhere in the neighborhood of seven.”
Some people could recall nine items on the list, some fewer than seven. But regardless of the things being recalled — colors and tastes, numbers with decimals, numbers without decimals, consonants, vowels — seven was the statistical average for short-term storage. (Long-term memory, which followed another cognitive formula, was virtually unlimited.)
Dr. Miller could not say why it was seven. He speculated that survival might have favored early humans who could retain “a little information about a lot of things” rather than “a lot of information about a small segment of the environment.”

￼But that, he concluded, was beside the point. He had articulated an idea that was to become a touchstone of cognitive science: that whatever else the brain might be, it was an information processor, with systems that obeyed mathematical rules, that could be studied.
Dr. Miller, who was trained in behaviorism, was among the first of many researchers and theorists to challenge its scientific principles in the 1950s. He and a colleague, Jerome S. Bruner, gave a name to the new research field when they established a psychology lab of their own, the Center for Cognitive Studies, at Harvard in 1960. Just by employing the word “cognitive,” considered taboo among behaviorists, they signaled a break with the old school.
“Using ‘cognitive’ was an act of defiance,” Dr. Miller wrote in 2006. “For someone raised to respect reductionist science, ‘cognitive psychology’ made a definite statement. It meant that I was interested in the mind.”
That new approach to psychological research came to be known as the cognitive revolution.
Dr. Miller’s first and most enduring interest as a scientist was language. His first book, “Language and Communication” (1951), is widely considered a foundational work in psycholinguistics, the study of how people learn, use and invent language. He collaborated with the linguist Noam Chomsky in groundbreaking papers on the mathematics of language and the computational problems involved in interpreting syntax.
He conducted some of the first experiments on how people understand words and sentences, the basis of computer speech-recognition technology. “Plans and the Structure of Behavior” (1960), written with Eugene Galanter and Karl H. Pribram, was an effort to synthesize artificial- intelligence research with psychological research on how humans initiate action — basically, a book about how to build a better robot. Beginning in 1986, he oversaw the development of WordNet, an electronic reference databank intended to help computers understand human language.
Colleagues said he had a role in framing many of his era’s most audacious thoughts about human and artificial thinking; typically, he then moved on to other projects.
“Like most great scientists, he became interested in some phenomenon or other and then simply jumped in to try to illuminate the problem,” said Michael S. Gazzaniga, a leading researcher in cognitive neuroscience at the University of California, Santa Barbara. Dr. Miller helped create the field of cognitive neuroscience in the late 1980s, he said. “He was exceptionally generous.”
George Armitage Miller was born on Feb. 3, 1920, in Charleston, W.Va., the only child of Florence and George Miller, who divorced when he was a child. His father was a steel company executive.
Mr. Miller and his first wife, Katherine, who died in 1996, married while both were undergraduates

￼at the University of Alabama. After graduating with a bachelor’s degree in English and speech, Mr. Miller received his master’s degree and Ph.D. in psychology at Harvard, serving in the Army Signal Corps during World War II in between.
He taught at Harvard beginning in 1955, heading its psychology department from 1964 until 1967, and later taught at Rockefeller University in New York and at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He joined the faculty of Princeton in 1979, founded the Cognitive Science Laboratory there and became a professor emeritus in 1990.
His survivors include his wife, Margaret, whom he married in 2008; a son, Donnally; a daughter, Nancy Saunders; and three grandchildren.
Dr. Miller’s paper on the number seven, which he read on April 5, 1955, at a meeting of the Eastern Psychological Association in Philadelphia, opened with a memorable line: “My problem is that I have been persecuted by an integer.”
He went on to make a topical reference to the Communist scare of the McCarthy era: “The persistence with which this number plagues me is far more than a random accident. There is, to quote a famous senator, a design behind it.”
The paper’s ground-shifting implications made it one of the most frequently quoted texts in the canon of modern psychology (and by Dr. Miller’s account, one of the most misquoted). For better or worse, “The Magical Number Seven” came to haunt his scientific career, overshadowing his many other accomplishments.
It resonated more playfully in his golf game. “He made the one and only hole-in-one of his life at the age of 77, on the seventh green” at the Springdale Golf Club in Princeton, his daughter said. “He made it with a seven iron. He loved that.”

Harry Frederick Harlow (1905-1981)
Harry Harlow was born in Fairview, Iowa, on October 31, 1905. He grew up in an extended family environ- ment, with a grandmother and two married but childless aunts in the neighborhood. Harry was the third of four closely spaced brothers who competed vigorously at bridge and tennis. No doubt this context provided a good learning situation for the art of riposte, for by the time he reached college he had already developed the quirky teasing humor that later became so well known to his colleagues. He went to Reed College for his freshman year, but transferred to Stanford in 1924 (AB,1927). He remained at Stanford for his graduate work (PhD, 1930), where he supported himself with the usual assistantships, teaching in social psychology for Paul Farnsworth and rat-researching for C. P. Stone. His dissertation on a pe- destrian rat problem, under the latter's guidance, soured him forever on both rats and parametric research. As a student, he began his study of the history of psychology. \ Indeed, he was always keenly aware of the history of psychological ideas as they touphed his work. It was this perspective, in part, that enabled him to revolutionize the fields of animal learning and motivation so incisively.
Harlow's first appointment was at Wisconsin, where he was asked to teach introductory psychology and direct the animal laboratory. He worked hard on his teaching, which proved to be exceptionally good, and with his wry wit, very popular. Always a knowledgeable general psy- chologist, he continued to teach the first course most years until his retirement in 1974. As for directing the laboratory, he wrote many years later that the task was difficult because there was no laboratory. Shortly he met Clara Mears, a teaching assistant in educational psy- chology, and she suggested that the Madison Zoo had monkeys if he wanted to work with them rather than with rats. He made the necessary contacts and began work with an orangutan. It died, but shortly^ the unU yersity provided him with a monkey laboratory of his own. In that same spring, 1932, he and Clara were mar- ried. She was a bright and engaging psychologist, but a conservative university could not tolerate the idea of a young wife seeking a degree from the faculty of which her husband was a member, so she became a highly Successful dress buyer for a' local department store.
Harlow's first interest was in cortical localization of higher intellectual functioning. Stanford had given him a solid background in physiology and neuroanatomy, and monkeys were appealing as subjects because of their ev- ident cognitive capacity. For this work he needed a stan- dardized set of measures of discrimination and other visual-perceptual processes. Gradually he constructed such an instrument, the Wisconsin General. Test Appa- ratus standard battery, but long before it was ready, he
had learned a great deal more about the learning process in rhesus monkeysthan he ever would about their central nervous system. What he discovered was the "learning set"—the process of learning to learn. In a series of simple discrimination problems, the monkeys first worked by trial and error, as conventional learning theory expected. But at some point they began to catch on to a general principle that allowed them to shortcut the process. Then they displayed one-trial learning: insight. The continu- ity-discontinuity controversy in learning theory was de- flated after years of fruitless rhetoric, and by the end of the 1940s Harlow had forced learning theorists to face the necessity of incorporating a more cognitive approach into their theories. This was Harlow's first victory in his battle with the Yale brand of behavior theory, and he relished it with as much joy as he had gotten earlier from his bridge and tennis victories (and with the same teasing manner toward his rivals).
A second confrontation was in the offing. Primary drive reduction as a reinforcer was at the heart of be- havior theory. Harlow's observations of his monkeys' behavior in learning situations made him doubt the im- portance of hunger as a goad to problem solving. On the contrary, well-fed animals approached their "school" with zest, curiosity proving more important than hunger as a motivator. He demonstrated its utility for both work and learning by setting up an observation chamber in which monkeys could manipulate a gadget in order to look through a peephole to another room. The monkeys would work many hours and solve many difficult dis- crimination problems to see—what? Not some aseptic abstraction, such as a clicking pendulum, but a real toy electric train running around a track.
In the meantime, after 15 years of marriage and two children, Harry and Clara Harlow divorced. Both re- married shortly, he to Margaret Kuenne, then a member of the Wisconsin faculty. During the next two decades they in turn had two children, and Margaret became an active and very productive collaborator in Harry's re- search of that period. Before that began there.was an interlude, however. During World War II Harry had not participated in the war research and service that had engaged many of his colleagues. He felt it was time he paid his tithe, and in 1949 he accepted appointment as Chief Psychologist to the U.S. Army. The Harlows lived in Washington for two years, he workingto develop more effective use of psychological research methods by the Army and she serving as an editor for APA publications. During this time Harry prepared and had accepted an Army staff study which established the Human Re- sources Research Office (HurnRRO) through a contract with the George Washington University. He persuaded

The work for which the Harlows are best known was their mainstream'research on the love relationship be- tween mother and child and among peers. According to Harry's report, this work began inauspiciously and very much by chance. He had attempted to start a breeding colony of rhesus monkeys. In order to keep the infants free of the pervasive diseases their mothers brought from India, he removed the infants at once and reared them in splendidly germ-free isolation from their mothers. The infants thrived physically but proved to be emotionally distorted as adults and would not mate. Harlow noted the way in which, as infants, the monkeys clung to their diapers as if to security blankets, and the intense emo- tional disturbance caused by forcible removal of the blankets. He inferred correctly that these objects had become mother surrogates, and he thought to design an artificial mother which could be varied in substance and action for experimental purposes. Thus was invented the cloth mother (and its wire mother counterpart) and with them came the discovery of contact comfort.
The stage was set for the new confrontation with be- havior theory, this time in the realm of motivation, per- sonality, and child rearing- For behavior theorists, the incentive value of previously neutral objects was ac- quired by association with primary drive reduction. Fol- lowing both Watson and Freud, they placed emphasis on very primitive cyclical biological drives. But although Harlow's monkeys were well-fed, they did not thrive nor did their meager diapers provide a significant other to whom they could become attached. So he constructed the static mother figure covered with terry cloth, gave her a single nipple, and allowed the infant to live with her. He reasoned that if the feeding was creating her incentive value, the infant should be as loving to one kind of figure as another. This did not prove to be so. A wire framed mother without the terry cloth was not fully rejected but it was quickly deserted for a cloth mother. Contact comfort seemed to be the truly primary incentive. A series of studies showed that other qualities could add quality to contact comfort, but not a great deal. Feeding, warmth, and rocking made small positive contributions, but were not nearly as powerful in pro- ducing love for the mother surrogate as behavior theory had assumed.
The next stage in this research on love was rich in findings about the experiences necessary for monkeys to develop mature personalities and competent adult be- havior. The Harlows were able to distinguish five love systems: maternal love for the child, infant love for the mother, age-mate or peer love, adult heterosexual love, and paternal love for the child. The infant-parent re-
lationship was a necessary precursor to the development of peer relationships, and both were required for the development of normal adult heterosexual love and ma- ternal behavior. Isolation of an infant for the first three months would be sufficient to interfere somewhat with further emotional growth, and isolation for six months would destroy any possibility of normal adult behavior, either sexual or social. Infants reared in isolation became autistic and showed the stereotypic movements and pos- tures, the rocking and huddling, so characteristic of some schizophrenic human children. Accompanying these symptoms was what appeared to be acute depression. In a final spurt of research activity just before his retire- ment, Harlow began the study of therapeutic interven- tion on these personality disorders. He found that the peer relationship could be reasonably well activated if the therapist monkey was just at the age of starting his or her own peer interaction and was much younger and less aggressive than the patient monkey.
Harlow's research career, spanning a full half century, was notable for its single-minded adherence to the search for understanding of a single species, for the imaginative methods he devised for the study of both cognition and motivation, and for the crucially important findings these methods provided. He was not a formal theorist in the style of a logician, nor was much of his research of the hypothesis-testing variety. But his careful empirical de- velopment of the facts of behavioral development led to prepositional generalizations that have contributed notably to an understanding of human as well as monkey motivational development. Although he often gave the appearance of a mischievous child teasing the Establish- ment, he was widely recognized and rewarded for his singular accomplishments. He was elected president of the APA,received Distinguished Scientific Contribution Awards from both the APA and the Society for Research in Child Development, the Gold Medal Award from the American Psychological Foundation, and the National Medal of Science. In 1975 he received the Kittay Inter- national Scientific Foundation A ward.
. Margaret Kuenne Harlow died of cancer in 1971. The following year Harry remarried his first wife, Clara, who was by then widowed. They moved to Tucson in 1974. During the late 1960s Harry's health deteriorated some- what; he appeared to be having trouble with alcohol, but eventually his main physical symptoms were diagnosed as parkinsonism. After his remarriage, and with suitable medication, he regained much of his former humor and vitality until he developed a brain tumor from which he died on December 6, 1981.

ABSTRACT Total social isolation of macaque monkeys for at least the first 6 months of life consistently produces severe deficits in virtually every aspect of social behavior. Experiments designed to rehabilitate monkeys reared in isolation are described. While young isolates exposed to equal-age normal peers achieved only limited recovery of simple social responses, some mothers reared in isolation eventually exhibited acceptable maternal behavior when forced to accept infant contact over a period of months, but showed no further recovery; isolate infants exposed to surrogates were able to develop crude interactive patterns among themselves. In contrast to the above results, 6- month-old social isolates exposed to 3-month-old normal monkeys achieved essentially complete social recovery for all situations tested. It is postulated that social stimula- tion that both permits subjects to achieve contact accept- ability and provides an interactive medium conducive to gradual development of sophisticated social behaviors will result in almost complete recovery of social capa- bilities previously obliterated by rearing in isolation.
Social isolation has long been identified as a powerful pre- cipitating agent in disruption of normal social development in human beings. While ethical considerations and practical constraints have obviously restricted controlled scientific study of isolation with human subjects, it has been possible to systematically investigate the effects of total social depriva- tion upon closely related, nonhuman, primate species. The unequivocal finding of numerous researches on macaque monkeys has been that total social isolation for at least the first 6 months of life enormously damages or destroys sub- sequent social and sexual behavioral capabilities (1-3). Monkeys so reared were grossly incompetent in interactions with socially normal age-mates. As infants and adolescents, they failed to initiate or reciprocate the play and grooming behaviors characteristic of their peers. As adults, these monkeys conisistently exhibited abnormal sexual, aggressive, and maternal behaviors.
It is clear that early social deprivation is an enormously effective procedure for the production of psychopathological behavior patterns. Less well known is the degree to which social behaviors can be recovered after early social isolation. The data that follow indicate that social deprivation early in life does not necessarily produce irreversible behavioral defi- cits, and that rehabilitation of varying extent can be ef- fected via judiciously chosen experimental procedures.
Several pairs of rhesus monkeys reared for the first 6 months of life in total social isolation chambers (4) were tested on a daily basis in a social playroom (4) with pairs of socially com- petent age-mates. In comparison to the normal stimulus animals, the isolates were clearly inferior on virtually every behavioral measure throughout the 8-month testing period.
They showed less object explorationi,social approach, social contact initiation, social threatening, and play, while ex- hibiting high levels of disturbance activity and rigid aind passive posturing (G. L. Rowland, unipublished doctoral dissertation, University of Wisconsin, 1964). Frequenitly, the isolates were targets of unprovoked aggiessioni by the control peers. However, in terms of responses directed toward each other and not toward the control moniikeys,the isolates showed limited recovery over the testing period.
From the fifth to the eighth moith of testing, the frequency of play behavior between the isolate pairs usually increased from a zero-baseline to fairly respectable levels. Although this was clearly delayed and unsophisticated play by monkey standards, a little late-play is better than mnoneI.nanimate object manipulation, which may be taken as a rough index of curiosity and exploratory tendencies, showed an evenlhigher level of restitution (Fig. 1). Threat was another social response that developed between pairs of isolate moniikeys,evenithough its exhibition was extremely delayed anidlimited. The threat response, which is a communicatory- mechanism, was judi- ciously expressed toward other isolates but was not directed toward the normal controls. These data suggested that mon- keys subjected to total social isolationi for a half-year period possessed latent potential for limited social recovery im- mediately after incarceration, even in the presence of ag- gressive normal peers. Monkeys reared in total social isolation for the first year of life showed no such recovery when tested under similar conditions (G. L. Rowland, unpublished ex- periments).
Social recovery of a different form was exhibited by another group of monkeys subjected to early social isolation. These were females who had reached sexual maturity but were apathetic or adamantly uncooperative when confronted with breeding-stock males that were sexually eager and

adroit. Bvymethods dark, dismal, and devious we impregnated several of these reluctant females over a period.of years. We have called them "motherless mothers," since they never ex- perienced mother love, nor any other kind of monkey af- fection, themselves. Most of the motherless mothers either completely ignored or abused their initial offspring (Fig. 2). However, unless the mothers actually killed their infants- and several did-the babies struggled for maternal contact day after day, week after week, month after month. The infants would cling to the motlhers' backs, continually at- tempting to achieve venitral and breast contact despite ef- forts by the mothers to displace them. To our surprise, ma- ternal brutality and indifference gradually decreased. From the fourth month onward, the persistent babies that were finally able to attain intimate physical contact with their mothers were actually punished less and permitted nipple contact more than offspring of normal mothers.
Many of the motherless mothers have had second and even third babies. Those whose maternal feelings were eventually released by the persistent and determined body contact and nursing efforts of their first infants proved to be adequate or good mothers to their subsequent babies. Most of the mother- less mothers that had abused or ignorel their first infants throughout a predetermined 6-month postpartum period con- tinued to be inadequate, brutal, or lethal mothers to sub- sequent progeny.
It seems that in the case of the adequate mnothers, the babies inadvertently served as psychotherapists to their indifferent mothers and that these mothers spontaneously transferred maternal feelings induced by their first babies to their feelings for subsequent babies. The data on the re- habilitated mothers suggested that infants possess some

specific abilities as behavioral therapists for abnormal adult females. However, rehabilitation was limited to maternal behavior and, in particular, those mothers continued to exhibit inappropriate and ineffective sexual behavior.
The rehabilitative potential of social contact was further illustrated in a third study. Four 6-month isolate monkeys were individually housed for 2 weeks after removal from the isolation chambers. Heated cloth surrogates were then in- troduced into their home cages. Within a few days the isolates began to contact the surrogates with increasing frequency and

duration. Correspondingly, the incidence of disturbance be- havior exhibited by the isolates showed a significant decrease from presurrogate levels. After 2 weeks of individual sur- rogate exposure, the isolates were housed in pairs. In this situation they almost spontaneously exhibited social play, infantile sex, locomotion, and exploratory behavior (Fig. 3), but the social behavior was clumsy and the isolates continued to display sporadic disturbance activity. After 6 months they had shown no marked improvement.
We have lobg emphasized that the mother figure is a basic socializing agent, since it gives to its owii infant social contact acceptability, essential to any subsequent social interaction- and basic security and trust. In this case surrogate mothers appeared to provide a certain degree of contact acceptability and security and trust sufficient for the isolates to suppress
existing self-directed disturbance activity and to initiate crude social interactions with other isolates. However, since the inanimate surrogates could provide no further social stimulation, recovery failed to progress beyond the above stage.
The above researches all used social agents as a means for rehabilitation, and to a limited extent recovery of some form was achieved. Experiments designed to rehabilitate isolates via nonsocial means, e.g., exposure to slides during isolation (C. L. Pratt, unpublished doctoral dissertation, University of Wisconsin, 1969), gradual introduction into the postisola- tion test environment (5), or aversive conditioning procedures (6) have been less successful. It is intuitively compelling to argue that the strategy most likely to succeed in rehabilita- tion of monkeys exhibiting social deficits should occur after stimulation of a social, rather than nonsocial, form. It may also be argued that the social stimulation utilized in the above studies was far less than optimal.

In the first experiments, normal age-mates may well have provided the isolate subjects with complex social stimnulation, but they certainly did not provide social contact acceptability. Rather, they aggressed against the isolates, a,nd not sur- prisingly, isolate recovery in this context was limited at best. In the case of the motherless mothers and their persistent infants, the babies provided their mothers with contact ac- ceptability but little else. Here, although relatively normal maternal behavior was recovered, other aspects of niorkey social activity were not. Likewise, surrogates provided iso- lates with contact acceptability, but for further social stimu- lation the isolates had only each other. They exhibited re- covery of only the most unsophisticated social responses.
A better monkey "therapist" would be one -that could provide contact acceptability without aggression, as well as more sophisticated social capabilities. Years of' research in which we investigated the normal social development of rhesus monkeys has indicated that a normally developing infant of 3-4 months of age fits these requirements almost perfectly. Therefore, we designed a study employing this type of monkey therapist.
Our therapists were four female rhesus infants that had been separated from their mothers at birth, but were raised in our nursery for 30 days and then housed with simplified surro- gates (Fig. 4) in quad cage quadrants (Fig. 5). Furthermore, the therapist monkeys interacted 2 hr a day in groups of two and four, in either a double quad cage quadlrant or in the standard playroom. Such rearing permitted relatively normal social development (7) (L. A. Rosenblum, unpublished doctoral dissertation, University of Wisconsin, 1961).
When four subjects raised from birth in total social isola- tion were 6 months of age and the therapists were 3 months

sessions was decreased and the number of playroom sessions involving two therapists and two isolates was progressively increased.
The isolates' initial responses to the therapy sessioniswere to huddle in a corner, and the therapists' first responses were to approach and cling to the isolates (Fig. 6). Within a week in the quad cages and a month in the playroom, the isolates were reciprocating the clinging. Concurrently, the therapists were developing play patterns of increasing sophistication among themselves and attempting to initiate such patterns with the isolates. Within 2 weeks in the quad cages and a month in the playroom, the isolates were reciprocating these behaviors.
By 1 year of age, the isolates were scarcely distinguishable from the normal therapists in terms of frequencies of ex- ploratory, locomotive, and play behaviors, an unprecedented reversal of the isolation syndrome. The decline of self-clasping and huddling, illustrated in Fig. 7, demonstrated a dramatic cumulative recovery from these infantile or depressed be-

haviors throughout the therapy period and a return to normal or near-normal levels by the end of 6 months. An interesting fact is that the therapists showed a modest increase in the self-clasp response, possibly learned from the isolates, even though their basic social behaviors did not deteriorate.
Even more dramatic was the precipitous decline in the more mature abnormal responses of rock and stereotypy (Fig. 8). By the fourth month of therapy, rock and stereotypy were at near-normal levels, and by the sixth month there were no differences-at least no differences between the deprived and therapist monkeys in absolute frequencies of these responses.
No doubt the most critical and valid measures of social recovery were those of social contact and play. Essentially complete recovery of both of these behavior patterns was attained by the isolates when they were tested with the therapist monkeys in the quad cage. In the larger and stranger playroom area there was eventually complete recovery of social contact and very satisfactory recovery of social play, as shown in Fig. 9. Mutual interactive play by isolate and therapist monkeys is illustrated in Fig. 10.
Because of limited animal availability, it was not possible to sex-balance both groups. All of the isolate monkeys were male and all of the therapist monkeys were female. We have long known that male and female monkeys play in funda- mentally different patterns (8). Male play is typically rough- and-tumble in form, where the monkeys wrestle, roll, and sham-bite but seldom injure one another. Females are much more likely to engage in noncontact, approach--withdrawal play, which involves chasing back and forth with frequent role reversal and a minimum of bodily contact. Since our female therapist monkeys played only female games, they could not have trained the socially deprived males in the ecstasies and elegancies of masculine play. However, in the final playroom sessions, the males clearly exhibited a pre- dominance of age-appropriate masculine play. Thus, the isolate males could not have developed their play patterns on the basis of imitation of the female therapist monkeys alone. Rather, it appears that the psychiatric sessions gradually im- parted to the males the full grandiose gifts of masculinity, which the males in turn expressed in their play bouts.
The earlier data presented in this paper made it obvious that monkeys socially damaged by isolation early in life
may attain very limited recovery of behavioral functions if they are allowed to interact for long periods of time with a group of equally socially blighted monkey subjects. The data also strongly indicate that the most elementary social be- haviors are the easiest to elicit in the recovery process, while exhibition of more complex behaviors by social isolates re- quires longer and more delicate procedures.
The present data suggest that therapist monkeys must be selected in such a manner as to present no threat to abnormal monkeys and that socialization is probably achieved in large part, but not entirely, through imitative learniingas the younger animals enter and pass through subsequent socializa- tion stages. Obviously many problems are left unresolved by the present study, such as the maximal age at which the isolates can be rehabilitated and the depths of depression that are minimal to socialization. Likewise, the maximal effective- ness of different therapeutic conditions is left unspecified. For example, should therapy begin with the formation or re-formation of maternal bonds antecedent to peer associa- tions, or should this be preceded by environmental adapta- tion? The present research has indicated that social rehabilita- tion of isolate-reared monkeys can be attained. It is the task of
further research to disclose better means to achieve this end.

ACTIV!TY
ACCURACY OF OBSERVATION Pau! J. \Moods
This activify provides an intriguing introduction to discussions of the accuracy and reliability of humans as observers of behavioral events and environmental characteristics.
A portable tape recorder, some imagination, and decent weather.
Introduce the activity to the students simply by explaining that you are going to test their powers of observation-their skill as observers. TelI them that you are going to ask a colleague of yours (or a particular member of the class) to lead the class on a 15- or 2O-minute joumey around the school grounds. Inform the students that nothing unusual has been planned, and instruct tlrem simply to observe the normal activities and circumstances in which they find themselves. They can be told that
following the walk, you will be asking them some questions about their observations.
As your colleague or class member is leading the class on the joumey aror:nd the campus, follow a strort distance behind-close enough to be able to observe the class and its environment but sufficiently removed to be able to speak quietly into a portable tape recorder without being heard by the class. As the walk proceeds, record approximately 50-60 questions on the tape, spontaneously drawn from your own observations of events and objects. (You may wish to prearrange the route to be followed and walk it through once by yourself to practice the questioning routine.) Each question you record should be followed immediately by the answer. Questions should be completely factual and objectively confirmable. Following are some examples:
"How many planes flew overhead as we reached the playing field?"
"In what activily was tfre first group of students encountered by the class engaged?"
"Where was the class when the nearby tmck backfired?"
"What color was the car that passed tlte class at the entrance to the parking lot?"
Avoid questiprns with answers that are a matter of opinion ("Was it a nice day?" "Did it se'em waim?" ).
Upon returning to the classroom, play each recorded question in turn and stop the recorder before the correct answer is played. Have students write their answers down on paper, and then play back the correct answer. On the chalkboard, keep a record of the number of right and wrong answers to each question.
The broad variation in student responses should provide gist for a discussion of (a) the reliabitity of human observations, (b) the "truth" of courtroom testimony, (c) the benefits of structuring tJre collection of

observations (perhaps by specifying beforehand what information is to be sought), and (d) the value and necessit5r of independent replication and confirmation of answers.

O PERANT CON DITIOIUING :
ROLE IN HI..'MIAN BEI{AuOR Edward Stork
From infancy onward, conditioning plays a major role in our lives. Yet most of us tend to downplay that role, possibly feeling that to admit such control over our behavior would be to admit that our lives are overly determined. Often when students read in their texts about classical and operant conditioning, tJrey tend to associate that type of leaming with infrahuman animals. That is, "Dogs, rats, and pigeons are aflected by conditioning, but it doesn't play any role in my behavior." This activity is designed to provide a starting point for discussion of conditioning in humans.
While discussing operant conditioning, intermpt your lecture with "Oh, by the way, before I forget again" and then ask a question to which you know you will get either an almost totally positive or negative response. For example, if your students are primarily seniors, you might say, "f was supposed to ask, how many of you have signed for a diploma for graduation?" All students will usually raise a hand. Then tell them to hold the position they are in and ask if anyone told them to raise their hands or even mentioned raising hands.
The usual response is a chorus of groans as the students recognize that they have been "used." Discuss the activit5i as an example of human conditioning. Ask students to generate other examples that describe conditioning in humans. You can use the ensuing discussion as a bridge to talking about conditioning techniques used with humans in behavior therapy.

            <Text> While there is a great deal to prepare for this game, my experience has taught me that the largest challenge the students will face is understanding that psychology and psychiatry were not always as they are now presented.  

Most students come to the game believing that (a) psychology is a science and (b) psychiatry is a medical practice.  Both of those claims were not settled in the public mind in 1970.  In fact, most of the tension in this game revolves around the efforts to make psychiatry conform to 'the medical model' and psychology conform to the model of the natural sciences, thereby legitimizing them as worthwhile endeavors.

Psychology, on the other hand, had been suffering a crisis of legitimacy since its inception, which is why so many of their arguments are really metatheoretical arguments on the nature of science.  The behaviorists believe that introducing new methodologies, like the cognitivists propose, would further weaken their claims to be a scientific discipline. </Text>

Cut out approximately 40 pieces of paper 2 inches x 2 inches. Then cut these 2-inch squares into a variet5r of shapes. TWenty of the pieces should have only straight edges, and 20 pieces should have at least one curved side each. (Save them in an envelope for repeated use.) Mix up the paper shapes and spread them out on a desk or table top. Ask for a student volunteer. Tell the volunteer to start picking up the pieces of paper one at a time and place them in a box. Each time the student picks one of the pieces that has a curye on it, say "Yes, that is correct." Each time the student picks up a completely straight-edged piece, give no reinforcement at all. Usually within 10 to 15 draws, the student will "learn" what has been defined as the "correct response" and will swiftly continue picking up pieces until all of the curved pieces are gone. (The students observing usually begin to approvingly glggle as the volunteer receives rapid positive reinforcements.)
Ask the student to tell the class what she or he has learned. Be sure to point out to the class thatthe only input given the student (aside frorn the initial direction to pick up pieces) was in the form of Positive Reinforcement. Nothing was said about shapes or any other facet of the task. Ask t.I:e student to relate to the class what went through his or her mind during the leaming process. Various trial-and-error strategies often emerge here (e.g., "At first I thought it was the larger pieces that were correct because t}le first big one I picked up was correct.") The basic operant-conditioning diagram provided here is helpful in summarizing for the class what they have just witnessed.

            <Text>

Generally speaking, our students come to psychology and psychiatry through textbooks. And as a result, they are primed to believe, unreflectively, that contemporary narrative of these disciplines is settled fact. Furthermore, these students know nothing of the rise and regularization of health insurance companies and billing procedures following the inception of Medicare and Medicaid in 1965. For them, managed care, billable hours and check-box diagnoses have always been a part of their medical experience. It was not in 1970. 

Since the 1970s, the psychiatrists and clinical psychologists have been under extraordinary pressure to create a system of diagnosis that will allow them to be compensated for their work under this system. Spitzer's shift from etiological psychiatry to descriptive psychiatry was a major step in that struggle. 

It is difficult to get them to feel the pressure to legitimize psychiatry and psychology that drove much of the work in this era. But one can make progress by explicitly emphasizing the crisis of legitimacy before beginning the game.

Many of the primary sources from this period---especially those from the members of the Spitzer task force---recall a time of great confusion. Spitzer is often characterized as acting almost singlehandedly, ignoring the hard work that others put into the classifications they proposed. If students feel confused and overwhelmed with all of the proposals being brought forward and the changes being made, that is partially intentional. 

While I believe that the removal of homosexuality was the correct decision, both morally and scientifically, that does not mean that the dissenters who point out the political bullying that went into passing the resolutions do not have a point. I want the students to come away with the sense that this period in the history of psychology and psychiatry was an all out scramble for legitimacy. Creating a sense of confusion and chaos is a necessary part of that environment.

            <Text>A Warning Sign on the Road to DSM‐5: Beware of its Unintended Consequences Allen Frances, MD
We should begin with full disclosure. As head of the DSM‐IV Task Force, I established strict guidelines to ensure that changes from DSM‐III‐R to DSM‐IV would be few and well supported by empirical data. Please keep this history in mind as you read my numerous criticisms of the current DSM‐V process‐especially its stated ambition to effect a "paradigm shift" in psychiatric diagnosis. It is reasonable for you to wonder whether I am carrying forward an inherently conservative bias or am protecting my own DSM‐IV baby. I think not and that instead I am identifying potentially grave problems in the DSM‐V goals, methods, and products. It is for the reader to judge my objectivity and the accuracy of my fears that, unless its course is corrected, DSM‐V will lead to many damaging unintended consequences.
Much of our work on the DSM‐IV centered on spotting and avoiding possible misuses of the system. Realizing that errors in the official system of psychiatric diagnosis can lead to all sorts of dreadful problems, we established a rigorous three‐stage procedure of empirical documentation to filter out mistakes. This consisted of systematic and extensive literature reviews, data reanalyses, and field testing that were conducted under well controlled conditions and in a wide variety of settings.1‐3 The null position was always to keep things stable. Thus, all suggested changes had to meet a high burden of empirical proof and risk/benefit analysis.
The work on DSM‐IV was transparent and widely inclusive.4 We knew how important it was to get as many critical comments as possible to assist us in spotting potential pitfalls and blind spots. To this end, we enlisted the help of over 1,000 advisors and, in particular, sought the opinions of those who were likely to be the most opposed to the possible changes being considered. In order to recruit as many comments as possible from users at large, we also prepared a regular and widely distributed newsletter and had a regular column in the journal Hospital and Community Psychiatry (now called Psychiatric Services).5
Our goal was to ensure that not only the DSM‐IV Task Force, but also the entire field, would understand precisely what we were doing and how we were going about it. The methods to be used for every step in the development of DSM‐IV were specified in advance and we closely adhered to them. It was made clear from the outset that there would be explicit accountability for decision‐making on all changes.
We published a number of articles to establish the methodology of the DSM‐IV empirical review, to indicate ways of judging the value and risks of "innovations,"5 and to fully discuss the pluses and minuses of the particular diagnostic changes that were under review.1,2,6‐9
In midstream, we published a widely distributed "Options Book"10 containing the alternative criteria sets proposed for every disorder. This gave everyone a chance to join us in evaluating each decision for change in DSM‐ IV. After the DSM‐IV was completed, we published four Sourcebooks, laying out in great detail the process and rationale for all the decisions that had been made, as well as their empirical support.11‐14
Why did we go to all this trouble in preparing DSM‐IV and why am I suggesting that the work on DSM‐V should now undergo a sharp mid‐term correction to provide safeguards by becoming far more transparent, explicit, and
conservative than it has been to date?
The work on DSM‐5 has, so far, displayed an unhappy combination of soaring ambition and remarkably weak methodology. First, let's expose the absurdity of the DSM‐V claim that it will constitute a "paradigm shift" in psychiatric diagnosis and indicate the dangers inherent in pursuing this false goal. The simple truth is that descriptive psychiatric diagnosis does not need and cannot support a paradigm shift. There can be no dramatic improvements in psychiatric diagnosis until we make a fundamental leap in our understanding of what causes mental disorders. The incredible recent advances in neuroscience, molecular biology, and brain imaging that have taught us so much about normal brain functioning are still not relevant to the clinical practicalities of everyday psychiatric diagnosis. The clearest evidence supporting this disappointing fact is that not even one biological test is ready for inclusion in the criteria sets for DSM‐5.
So long as psychiatric diagnosis is stuck at its current descriptive level, there is little to be gained and much to be lost in frequently and arbitrarily changing the system. Descriptive diagnosis should remain fairly stable until, disorder by disorder, we gradually attain a more fundamental and explanatory understanding of causality.
Remember that there has been only one paradigm shift in psychiatric diagnosis in the last 100 years‐‐the introduction of operational criteria sets and the multiaxial system in the DSM‐III.15,16 With these methodological advances, DSM‐III rescued psychiatric diagnosis from unreliability and the oblivion of irrelevancy. In the evolution of descriptive diagnosis, DSM‐III‐R and DSM‐IV were really no more than footnotes to DSM‐III and, at best, DSM‐V could only hope to join them in making a modest contribution. Descriptive diagnosis is simply not equipped to carry us much further than it already has. The real paradigm shift will require an increase in our knowledge‐not just a rearrangement of the furniture of the various descriptive possibilities.
Part of the exaggerated claim of a "paradigm shift" in DSM‐5 is based on the suggestion that it will be introducing 30 or more dimensional ratings and that this will increase the precision of diagnosis. I am a big fan of dimensional diagnosis and wrote a paper promoting its use as early as 1982.17 Naturally, I had hoped to expand the role of dimensional diagnosis in DSM‐IV, but I came to realize that busy clinicians do not have the time, training, or inclination to use dimensional ratings. Indeed, the dimensional components already built into the DSM system (i.e., severity ratings of mild, moderate, and severe for every disorder and the Axis V Global Assessment of Functioning scale) are very often ignored. Including an ad hoc, untested, and overly complex dimensional system in an official nomenclature is premature and will likely lead to similar neglect and confusion.18 Providing an opportunity for dimensional ratings certainly does not constitute a paradigm shift and should not be oversold.
If the potential gains of DSM‐V are likely to be extremely modest, the potential risks are great and, so far, have gone largely unrecognized. Making changes in the diagnostic system is never cheap or free of risks. Just as when treating an individual patient, the first consideration in revising the diagnostic classification must always be to "do no harm"‐and the harm inflicted by changes in the DSM diagnostic system can come in many, and usually unexpected, forms.
The most obvious adverse outcome is the significant burden to the field of having to learn and adapt to any changes included in DSM‐5. This cost will be borne by all clinicians, educators, administrators, and especially by mental health researchers.19 The most noxious changes are those that frivolously lead to a need for new diagnostic instruments (or result in findings that are not comparable over studies and over time). This wastes money, slows progress, and makes it far more difficult to translate research findings into clinical practice. Any "innovations" made in DSM‐5 should be clear and proven winners or they will not be worth the high overhead cost
inherent in any change. Moreover, my experience suggests that, unless strong supporting evidence is required for the changes made in DSM‐5, it is likely that many of the changes will inevitably be trivial, arbitrary, and excessively influenced by the views of one or several strong‐minded experts in any given work group.
There is also the serious, subtle, and ubiquitous problem of unintended consequences. As a rule of thumb, it is wise to assume that unintended consequences come often and in very varied and surprising flavors. For instance, a seemingly small and reasonable change can sometimes result in a different definition of caseness that may have a dramatic and totally unexpected impact on the reported rates of a disorder.20 Thus are false "epidemics" created. For example, although many other factors were certainly involved, the sudden increase in the diagnosis of autistic disorder, attention‐deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and bipolar disorder may in part reflect changes made in the DSM‐IV definitions. Note that this serious unintended consequence occurred despite the fact that careful field testing of the DSM‐IV versions of two of these disorders had predicted no substantial differences in their rates as measured by DSM‐III, DSM‐IV, and ICD‐10 criteria.21,22
The crucial lesson here is that even careful field testing is never completely accurate in predicting what will happen when the system is eventually used in the actual field. This issue becomes particularly poignant when one considers the great and skillful pressure that is likely to be applied by the pharmaceutical industry after the publication of DSM‐5. It has to be assumed that they will attempt to identify every change that could conceivably lead to a marketing advantage‐often in ways that will not have occurred to the DSM‐5 Task Force. In order to promote drug sales, the companies may well sponsor expensive "education" campaigns focusing on the diagnostic changes that most enhance the rate of diagnosis for those disorders that will lead to the increased writing of prescriptions. It should, therefore, be no surprise if there are many new "epidemics" based on changes in DSM‐V.
This risk is accentuated by the fact that the field testing for DSM‐5 will receive no support from the National Institute of Mental Health. The necessary resources will not be available to measure the impact of suggested changes on the reliability and reported rates of diagnoses in the widely varied settings in which DSM‐5 will be used. In addition, because no DSM‐5 Options Book or first draft is being produced, the "DSM‐5 field trials" are not really field trials at all‐they are no more than primary data collections that will have little to say about how the final draft of DSM‐5 will perform in the field. DSM‐V decision‐making regarding changes will therefore be flying fairly blind.
Further accentuating is that almost everyone responsible for revising the DSM‐5 has spent a career working in the atypical setting of university psychiatry. This type of clinical experience is restricted to highly selected patients who are often treated in a research context. It is a basic tenet of clinical epidemiology that research results and clinical experience derived from tertiary care settings often do not generalize well when the diagnostic system has to be applied routinely in a more population‐based manner.23,24
Thus, the attempt to shift paradigms in the DSM‐5 is built on a shallow foundation that will greatly increase the risk of embarrassing post publication surprises. The ways to minimize the risks are to be cautious in making changes and to demand high levels of evidence about their utility and impact.
Unintended consequences are particularly unpredictable and consequential in forensic settings. Years after the DSM‐IV was completed, we learned about the enormous and unintended impact of a seemingly slight wording change we had made only for technical reasons in the section on paraphilias. A misreading of our intentions in making the change had led to great confusion25‐with forensic evaluators using the diagnosis of paraphilia not otherwise specified (NOS) to justify the sometimes inappropriate lifetime psychiatric commitment of rapists who
had no real mental disorder. The lesson is that even small changes can have destructive unanticipated forensic consequences.
The likelihood that DSM‐5 will suffer from many and serious unintended consequences is enhanced by the way it is being done. "There are no constraints on the degree of change," according to a telling quote from Dr. David Kupfer, chairman of the DSM‐V Task Force.26 The work groups have been instructed to think innovatively about the disorders under their purview. They have received little guidance on the systematic methods that can be used when conducting literature reviews.6 They have also not reviewed the DSM‐IV Sourcebooks to learn from our experience in evaluating the pluses and minuses for many of the very same decisions they are now confronting. It is a fundamental error of the DSM‐5 process that it has no a priori methods in place to provide standards for making changes and for instructing Work Group members on how to do a careful risk/benefit analysis of each proposal.
Even a cursory review of some of the suggestions for DSM‐5 clearly illustrates the painful surprises that can inadvertently creep into a system if there are no careful doorkeepers to evaluate the risks of change. I will discuss some representative types of problems for purposes of illustration?but most of the suggested changes for DSM‐V will likely have
problems of one sort or another.
Undoubtedly, the most reckless suggestion for DSM‐V is that it include many new categories to capture the milder subthreshhold versions of the existing more severe official disorders. The beneficial intended purpose is to reduce the frequency of false negative missed cases?thus improving early case finding and promoting preventive treatments. Unfortunately, however, the DSM‐V Task Force has failed to adequately consider the potentially disastrous unintended consequence that DSM‐V may flood the world with new false positives. The reported rates of DSM‐V mental disorders would skyrocket, especially since there are many more people at the boundary than those who present with the more severe and clearly "clinical" disorders. The result would be a wholesale imperial medicalization of normality that will trivialize mental disorder and lead to a deluge of unneeded medication treatments‐‐a bonanza for the pharmaceutical industry but at a huge cost to the new false positive "patients" caught in the excessively wide DSM‐V net. They will pay a high price in side effects, dollars, and stigma, not to mentions the unpredictable impact on insurability, disability, and forensics.
In my experience, experts on any given diagnosis always worry a great deal about missed cases, but rarely consider the risks of creating a large pool of false positives?especially in primary care settings. The experts' motives are pure, but their awareness of risks is often naïve. Psychiatry should not be in the business of inadvertently manufacturing mental disorders. I would therefore suggest that none of the proposed subthreshold suggestions be converted into official diagnoses of mental disorder in DSM‐V. Each should instead be included in an appendix of suggested disorders that require more research and testing.
A second, related category of innovation would be to include as defined mental disorders "prodromal" forms of the schizophrenic, mood, dementing and perhaps other disorders. This again has the obvious appeal of promoting early case finding and preventive treatment, but it also has all the same devastating problems we have just discussed. For example, adding a new "pre‐psychotic" category for individuals supposedly at high risk for later developing a psychotic disorder would inevitably also capture an overwhelmingly large group of false positives who would never go on to have a psychotic illness. They would nonetheless be exposed to the stigma of having a pre‐psychotic diagnosis and would be overmedicated. Similarly, wouldn't it be nice to diagnose and treat early cognitive failure before it becomes dementia? But then almost everyone over sixty might qualify to receive a
probably useless, but highly promoted treatment.
This is a drug company's dream come true. They would undoubtedly find ways of penetrating the huge new markets with medications having largely unproven benefit and very substantial side effects. Also to be considered carefully are the always possible unforeseen problems caused by stigma and the unforeseen misuse of the new diagnoses in forensic, disability, and insurance settings. Finally, the clinching argument against including prodromes is that they are supported only by thin literatures and will not have extensive field trials to predict the extent of the false positive risks, especially in primary care settings. Again, it would be far better to put these suggestions in the DSM‐V appendix than to make them official mental disorders.
A third category of DSM‐V innovation would create a whole new series of so‐called "behavioral addictions" to shopping, sex, food, videogames, the Internet, and so on. Each of these proposals has received little research attention, and they all have the potential for dangerous unintended consequences, by inappropriately medicalizing behavioral problems, reducing individual responsibility, and complicating disability, insurance, and forensic evaluations. None of these suggestions are remotely ready for prime time as officially recognized mental disorders.
I do not have space to enumerate the dangers of all the other innovative suggestions for DSM‐V, but I will list just some of the riskiest that require the most careful review and caution: adult attention‐deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and adult separation anxiety disorder; making it easier to diagnose bipolar disorder; pediatric bipolar, major depressive, and trauma disorders; autism spectrum disorders; new types of paraphilias and hypersexuality disorder; and the suggested rating list to evaluate suicidality.
The DSM‐V Task Force should be (but is not) routinely and quickly shooting down suggestions with obvious risks. But it should also be carefully and deeply probing into the much less obvious risks posed by every change. Getting as much outside opinion as possible is crucial to smoking out and avoiding unforeseen problems. We believed that the more eyes and minds that were engaged at all stages of DSM‐IV, the fewer the errors we would make. In contrast, DSM‐V has had an inexplicably closed and secretive process.27 Communication to and from the field has been highly restricted. Indeed, even the slight recent increase in openness about DSM‐V was forced on to an unwilling leadership only after a series of embarrassing articles appeared in the public press.28‐30 It is completely ludicrous that the DSM‐V Workgroup members had to sign confidentiality agreements that prevent the kind of free discussion that brings to light otherwise hidden problems. DSM‐V has also chosen to have relatively few and highly selected advisors. it appears that it will have no Options Book to allow wide scrutiny and contributions from the field.
The secretiveness of the DSM‐V process is extremely puzzling. In my entire experience working on DSM‐III, DSM‐III‐ R, and DSM‐IV, nothing ever came up that even remotely had to be hidden from anyone. There is everything to gain and absolutely nothing to lose from having a totally open process. Obviously, it is much better to discover problems before publication‐and
this can only be done with rigorous scrutiny and the welcoming of all possible criticisms.
In summary, then, I have little confidence that the DSM‐V leadership will do the kind of careful risk/benefit analysis of each proposed change that is necessary to avoid damaging unintended consequences. My concerns arise from: 1) their ambition to achieve a "paradigm shift" when there is no scientific basis for one 2) their failure to provide clear methodological guidelines on the level of empirical support required for changes; 3) their lack of openness to wide scrutiny and useful criticism; 4) their inability to spot the obvious dangers in most of their current proposals; 5) their failure to set and meet clear timelines; and 5) the likelihood that time pressure will soon lead to an
unconsidered rush of last minute decisions.
This is the first time I have felt the need to make any comments on DSM‐V. Even when the early steps in the DSM‐ V process seemed excessively ambitious, secretive, and disorganized, I hoped that I could avoid involvement and believed that my successors deserved a clear field. My unduly optimistic assumption was that the initial problems of secrecy and lack of explicitness would self‐correct and that excessive ambitions would be moderated by experience. I have decided to write this commentary now only because time is beginning to run out and I fear that DSM‐V is continuing to veer badly off course?and with no prospect of spontaneous internal correction. It is my responsibility to make my worries known before it is too late to act on them. What is needed now is a profound mid‐term correction toward greater openness, conservatism, and methodological rigor. I would thus suggest that the trustees of the American Psychiatric Association establish an external review committee to study the progress of the current work on DSM‐V and make recommendations for its future direction.

DEFENSE NNECHANISMS .fack J. Greider
This activit5r is designed to increase student familiarity with the ways in which defense mechanisms are used. In addition to being a good teaching tool, the activity allows for the expression of a considerable amount of creativity on the part of the students' Defense mechanisms covered include regression, rationalization, repression, projection, fantasy, compensation, identification, and reaction formatjon.
Ask for eight student volunteers for a role-playing exercise' I usually choose four males and four females, since I have found mixed pairs to work best in this activity. Have these eight students leave the room and go with them to explain what they are to do. First group them in male-female pairs and assign two of the defense mechanisms to each pair. Instruct each pair of students to make up two skits, one for each of the mechanisms. I usually allow them about 15 minutes to prepare their skits. While they are working, go back into the room, list the defense mechanisms on the chalkboard, and discuss each one briefly with the class. Then call the role players back into the room to put on their skits. Have each pair perform one of their two skits, and after going through the pairs have each pair do their second skit. The job of t]le class is to guess which mechanism each skit represents.
In discussion you can point out the place of defense mechanisms in personality theory. You should comment on the role of defense mechanisms in normal functioning. When are these mechanisms helpfi:l? When are tlrey harmfr.rl? Conduct an anonyrnous survey of your students asking them to indicate whether or not they have used any of the defense mechanisms during the past year. Do they use some defense mechanisms more tltan others? If so, which ones?

**APA Task Force** (in Spitzer’s role sheet)

&gt; A Medical disorder is a relatively distinct condition resulting from an organismic dysfunction which in its fully developed or extreme form is directly and intrinsically associated with distress, disability, or certain other types of disadvantage.  The disadvantage may be of a physical, perceptual, sexual, or interpersonal nature. Implicitly there is a call for action on the part of the person who has the condition, the medical or its allied professions, and society.
A mental disorder is a medical disorder whose manifestations are primarily signs or symptoms of a psychological (behavioral) nature, or if physical, can be understood only using psychological concepts. (1978, p. 18)

**Behaviorist**

&gt; A person can be called 'mentally ill' when he or she exhibits emotional or behavioral functioning which is so impaired as to interfere substantially with his or her capacity to function in society. 

**Psychoanalytic** 

&gt; A person is mentally ill when he or she suffers from internal conflicts that may be subconscious or unconscious, manifesting behavior that is unwanted or disturbing to the individual or the society.


**Szasz** (and maybe) **Albee**

&gt; There is no 'thing' called 'mental illness,' only  sets of behaviors that may be destructive to an individual and his or her society.


##### Possible Mod: DSMIV compromise

If the game master chooses, he or she may introduce or encourage the development of a compromise position like that found in the DSM-IV: 

&gt;… although this manual provides a classification of mental disorders, it must be admitted that no definition adequately specifies precise boundaries for the concept of ‘mental disorder.’ The concept of mental disorder, like many other concepts in medicine and science, lacks a consistent operational definition that covers all situations. All medical conditions are defined on various levels of abstraction--for example, structural pathology (e.g., ulcerative colitis), symptom presentation (e.g., migraine), deviance from a physiological norm (e.g., hypertension), and etiology (e.g., pneumococcal pneumonia). Mental disorders have also been defined by a variety of concepts (e.g., distress, dyscontrol, disadvantage, disability, inflexibility, irrationality, syndromal pattern, etiology, and statistical deviation). Each is a useful indicator for a mental disorder, but none is equivalent to the concept, and different situations call for different definitions.” 

With something like the 7 part definition included there in:

*Features*
&gt;A a clinically significant behavioral or psychological syndrome or pattern that occurs in an individual

&gt;B is associated with present distress (e.g., a painful symptom) or disability (i.e., impairment in one or more important areas of functioning) or with a significantly increased risk of suffering death, pain, disability, or an important loss of freedom

&gt;C must not be merely an expectable and culturally sanctioned response to a particular event, for example, the death of a loved one

&gt;D a manifestation of a behavioral, psychological, or biological dysfunction in the individual

&gt;E neither deviant behavior (e.g., political, religious, or sexual) nor conflicts that are primarily between the individual and society are mental disorders unless the deviance or conflict is a symptom of a dysfunction in the individual


*Other Considerations*
&gt;F no definition adequately specifies precise boundaries for the concept of “mental disorder”

&gt;G the concept of mental disorder (like many other concepts in medicine and science) lacks a consistent operational definition that covers all situations

PREFACE
The APA Guidelines for the Undergraduate Psychology Major (hereinafter referred to as the Guidelines) captures a set of optimal expectations for performance at the completion of the baccalau- reate degree by students who major in psychology. The document out- lines 10 goals and suggested learning outcomes that represent reasonable departmental expectations for the undergraduate psychology major across educational contexts. The goals are divided into two major categories:
• Knowledge, skills, and values consistent with the science and application of psychology
• Knowledge, skills, and values consistent with liberal arts education that are further developed in psychology
Although the Guidelines can aid in curriculum design, goal setting, and assessment planning, faculty are encouraged to consider local factors, such as institutional and departmental missions and student characteristics, in their application. In this spirit, broad discussion of the document can facilitate departmental leadership in designing programs distinctively suited to the institution’s mission and students’ needs while attending to good practice benchmarks.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Why Do We Need the APA Guidelines for the Undergraduate Psychology Major?
For some time, there has been widespread concern about the quality of education at all levels in the United States, along with increasing pressure for accountability. Current best practices in
higher education rely on setting clear expectations for student learning, aligning curricula with these expectations, assessing student attainment, and using assessment results to effect changes that promote better stu- dent learning.
It was in this context that the Board of Educational Affairs (BEA) of the American Psychological Association (APA) appointed a task force to describe a set of learning goals and outcomes for student performance at the completion of the baccalaureate degree. The APA Guidelines for the Undergraduate Psychology Major was developed to articulate a common set of outcomes. A baccalaureate degree in psychology should document that students have the ability to think scientifically about behavior, the skills related to the conduct of research, and the values that reflect psychology as both a science and an applied discipline.
Variations in psychology’s academic organization in institutions of higher education across the country make it difficult to achieve consen-
sus on learning goals and outcomes. In some colleges and universities, psychology is part of a school or college comprising the social sciences.
In others, psychology is aligned with the natural sciences, the humani-
ties, or education. In addition to having organizational diversity, psychol- ogy departments differ with respect to programmatic emphases, student characteristics, faculty expertise, and resources. Undergraduate programs vary—as they should—to meet local, state, and regional needs. Despite 1 these differences, the BEA task force developed goals and outcomes that could be applied broadly across diverse educational contexts (e.g., campus-based programs, online instruction) in the context of liberal education at the undergraduate level.
The Guidelines captures a set of optimal expectations for student performance at the completion of the baccalaureate degree. Applying

these to individual departments, faculty must take into account local factors such as institutional and departmental missions and student characteristics. Regardless of department size and resources, the Guidelines presents reasonable overarching goals for the undergraduate psychology curriculum. Toward this end, these guidelines were developed to aid in curriculum design, goal setting, and assessment planning for the psychology major.
In addition to providing guidance about what constitutes a high-quality undergraduate education for majors in psychology, the Guidelines responds to a number of other important related needs:
•
•
•
•
The Guidelines firmly establishes the major as a science and reinforces a common identity within the discipline. Promoting psychology as a science is increasingly important given the enormous breadth of the discipline and the diversity of professional opportunities and psychological perspectives, including new interdisciplinary configurations.
The Guidelines describes a set of learning goals and outcomes for the psychology major. By making the expectations (outcomes) clear, the Guidelines serves as the basis for assessment plans.
Development of the Guidelines is an important step for the disci- pline and a means of contributing to a growing international effort to articulate goals and outcomes for the major. Dissemination and implementation of the Guidelines could also generate research on effective practices in undergraduate education in psychology.
Building on APA’s earlier efforts when approving the National Standards for the Teaching of High School Psychology (APA, 1999) and the revised National Standards for High School Psychology Curricula (APA, 2005), the Guidelines continues APA’s national focus on quality improvement. Completing expectations for appropriate education at the 4-year level adds an important piece of the
overall education and training context in psychology (see Benjamin, 2001).
The Guidelines provides a common set of outcomes that could aid in the development and evaluation of distance-learning courses and programs by promoting expectations for student learning compara- ble to those used in traditional classrooms.

APA GUIDELINES FOR THE UNDERGRADUATE PSYCHOLOGY MAJOR
Assumptions Underlying the Undergraduate Learning Outcomes
The learning goals and outcomes in this document rest on several key assumptions about the psychology major, the dynamic nature of the discipline, the diversity of psychology departments across the United States, and the assessment of performance relative to out- comes. As a framework for understanding the Guidelines, these assump- tions are that the learning goals and outcomes
• encompass the knowledge, skills, and values that are important for students to acquire in an undergraduate major in psychology within the context of a liberal education;
• incorporate the broad theoretical and research bases of psychology;
• reflect the use of a variety of pedagogical models, including service- learning, research and laboratory experiences, online applications, and traditional classroom approaches;
• foster the development of lifelong learning skills and include competencies that will prepare students for entrance into the workforce or acceptance into graduate or professional schools upon receipt of the baccalaureate degree;
• reflect the importance of diversity and cross-cultural issues in the discipline, as well as the growing internationalization of psychology and the need to prepare psychology majors to understand behavior and experience that may transcend geographic boundaries;
• apply to psychology departments across institutional settings that contribute to student achievement at the baccalaureate level;
• reflect the views that any outcome is meaningful only to the extent that it is accurately assessed and that the outcomes assessment process will focus on student performance if it is to improve learning and teaching;
3
￼• allow for many legitimate ways to reach a learning outcome, especially given that outcomes are developmental in nature; individual psychology departments determine the performance levels appropriate for their students and the assessment procedures and tools appropriate to measuring their students’ performance.
APA GUIDELINES FOR THE UNDERGRADUATE PSYCHOLOGY MAJOR
Use of the Term Guidelines
The term guidelines generally refers to pronouncements, statements, or declarations that recommend or suggest specific actions, goals, or endeavors. In this spirit, they are aspirational in intent. They are not intended to be mandatory or exhaustive and may not be applica- ble to every situation, nor are they intended to take precedence over the judgment of college and university faculty.
This use of the term guidelines is consistent with general practices
in the undergraduate education community. A primary consideration related to the nature of the document is the issue of academic freedom. The American Association of University Professors (AAUP) published a seminal paper articulating the principles of academic freedom meant to ensure the fundamental advancement of truth (see AAUP, 2006). Teachers are explicitly granted the right to exercise freedom in their discussions about respective disciplinary matters. Therefore, the Guidelines should be used only as a broad and general framework for
the undergraduate psychology major.
The term guidelines is also consistent with terminology used by other scientific organizations. The American Chemical Society (ACS; 2003) provides guidelines for the undergraduate major in chemistry. Although the ACS guidelines are for the purpose of accreditation, they offer only general curricular goals rather than an exact curriculum. Similarly, the American Physical Society, through the American Association of Physics Teachers (see Hilborn, Howes, &amp; Krane, 2003), provides general guidance for the undergraduate major in their report on the status of the undergraduate major in physics.
Finally, as used in this document, the term guidelines is consistent with the provisions of the APA policy on Developing and Evaluating Standards and Guidelines Related to Education and Training in Psychology
4 (Section I C[1]) (APA, 2004), as passed by the APA Council of Representatives.
Process of Developing the Guidelines
Five reports preceded the development of these guidelines, and many individuals and groups contributed to their initial develop- ment. Study of the curriculum can be traced back to the summer
￼APA GUIDELINES FOR THE UNDERGRADUATE PSYCHOLOGY MAJOR
of 1951 with the issuance of the Cornell Conference Report. This report emphasized psychology as a science grounded in the tradition of the liber- al arts. The report merely suggested that one introductory course should be followed by intermediate core courses (e.g., statistics and perception) and finally by advanced courses (e.g., social psychology and learning). The Michigan Conference Report followed approximately 10 years later, with less consensus about the structure of the undergraduate curriculum. Similarly, the Kulik Report (in 1973) and the Schreirer and Rogers Report (in 1985) provided only descriptive information about the undergraduate major (for more information on these reports, see Brewer et al., 1993). Ultimately, at the St. Mary’s Conference in 1991, Charles Brewer and his committee from the APA National Conference on Enhancing the Quality of Undergraduate Education in Psychology provided a broad structure for the undergraduate curriculum. Defining seven goals for the undergraduate major, Brewer and his colleagues suggested that the curriculum should include an introductory course, methodology courses, subfield content courses, and an integrative experience.
It was in this context, together with the movement in higher education to identify competencies as learning objectives, that the BEA appointed the Task Force on Psychology Major Competencies in 2000 to develop learning goals and outcomes for the undergraduate psycholo- gy major. Members of the task force represented a variety of institutional perspectives on the nature of the undergraduate curriculum and its aims. Under the leadership of Jane S. Halonen (chair), task force members included Drew C. Appleby, Charles L. Brewer, William Buskist, Angela R. Gillem, Diane Halpern, G. William Hill IV, Margaret A. Lloyd, Jerry L. Rudmann, and Valjean M. Whitlow. APA staff who contributed their expertise included Bernard C. Beins, now at Ithaca College, Maureen McCarthy, presently at Kennesaw State University, and Martha Boenau of the APA Education Directorate.
In the early stages of their work, the task force patterned its document after the guidelines developed by the Task Force on Outcomes for the California State University System, led by Mary Allen and Diane Halpern (past president of APA). The task force prepared a document that would serve as a resource to undergraduate psychology departments and faculty to assist with academic review processes and curriculum planning. As described in the Undergraduate Psychology Major Learning Goals and Outcomes (APA, 2002b), the task force identified 10
5
￼APA GUIDELINES FOR THE UNDERGRADUATE PSYCHOLOGY MAJOR
goals and suggested learning outcomes representing reasonable depart- mental expectations for the undergraduate psychology major across educational contexts. The goals were divided into two major categories: (a) knowledge, skills, and values consistent with the science and applica- tion of psychology and (b) knowledge, skills, and values consistent with liberal arts education that are further developed in psychology.
To extend representation to a diverse array of institutions and relevant organizations, the task force assembled an advisory panel to review drafts of the document. Through this process, the document was widely distributed to faculty at research universities, comprehensive universities, 4-year colleges, 2-year colleges, and high schools. Their comments were integrated into the Guidelines. The task force also sought and received helpful feedback from members of related profes- sional organizations with interests in psychology curricula. A final version of this document was endorsed by the BEA in March 2002 and made available to the undergraduate community as a report published on the APA Education Directorate Web site (see APA, 2002b).
By July 2002, the report was disseminated broadly to APA gover- nance groups and APA divisions, with a request for review and feedback. The Guidelines was also reviewed for attention to individual and cultural diversity issues consistent with the Guidelines on Multicultural Education, Research, Practice, and Organizational Change for Psychologists (APA, 2003); in addition, it was reviewed by the APA Committee on Ethnic Minority Affairs and the Committee on Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual Concerns. APA Boards and Committees received a final draft of the document in the spring of 2006. Subsequently, upon recommendation of the APA Board of Directors, the APA Council of Representatives adopted the Guidelines in August 2006.
Resource Documents
6 In developing the Guidelines, the task force reviewed the existing guidelines used by science-based disciplinary societies similar to APA, such as the American Chemical Society, the American
Physical Society (APS), and the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (ASBMB). These guidelines on the undergraduate curriculum were found to be similar in structure to the APA guidelines. For example, ASBMB (see Voet et al., 2003) explicitly stated that it was
￼APA GUIDELINES FOR THE UNDERGRADUATE PSYCHOLOGY MAJOR
no longer recommending a course-based curriculum. Instead, ASBMB provided content and student-outcome-focused guidance. Additional resources included use of the APA Ethical Principles of Psychologists and Code of Conduct (APA, 2002a) and the Handbook for Enhancing Undergraduate Education in Psychology (McGovern, 1993). The content contained in the Guidelines is consistent with APA’s Ethics Code.
Feedback
The Guidelines is a “living document.” Accordingly, APA has established a systematic plan for periodically reviewing and revising such documents to reflect developments in the discipline and in education. Reviews will occur every 7 years, which is consistent with APA Association Rule 30-8.3 requiring cyclical review of approved standards and guidelines within periods not to exceed 10 years. Comments and sug- gestions are welcomed.

APA GUIDELINES FOR THE UNDERGRADUATE PSYCHOLOGY MAJOR
Structure of the Guidelines
The APA Guidelines for the Undergraduate Psychology Major provides details for 10 suggested goals and related learning outcomes for the psychology major, grouped into two major categories.
Categories of Learning Goals and Outcomes
I. Knowledge, Skills, and Values Consistent With the Science and Application of Psychology
This category represents activities that provide hallmarks of psychology education. Responsibility for development in and assessment of these areas rests primarily with the psychology faculty in coursework or psychology advising.
II. Knowledge, Skills, and Values Consistent With Liberal Arts Education That Are Further Developed in Psychology
This category includes activities that are usually part of a general education program or liberal education. Responsibility for student development in these areas and assessment of students’ achievements tend to be shared across a broader range of disciplines than just psychology; however, psy- chology coursework can contribute to and expand upon these general edu- cation goals in significant ways. In turn, well-developed liberal education skills can contribute to student achievement within the psychology major.
Learning Goals
I. Knowledge, Skills, and Values Consistent With the Science and Application of Psychology 9
Goal 1: Knowledge Base of Psychology
Students will demonstrate familiarity with the major concepts, theoretical perspectives, empirical findings, and historical trends in psychology.
Goal 2: Research Methods in Psychology

￼
￼10
psychology, including research design, data analysis, and interpretation.
Goal 3: Critical Thinking Skills in Psychology

Goal 4: Application of Psychology
Students will understand and apply psychological principles to personal, social, and organizational issues.
Goal 5: Values in Psychology
Students will be able to weigh evidence, tolerate ambiguity, act ethically, and reflect other values that are the underpinnings of psychology as a discipline.
II. Knowledge, Skills, and Values Consistent With Liberal Arts Education That Are Further Developed in Psychology
Goal 6: Information and Technological Literacy
Students will demonstrate information competence and the ability to use computers and other technology for many purposes.
Goal 7: Communication Skills
Students will be able to communicate effectively in a variety of formats.
Goal 8: Sociocultural and International Awareness

Goal 10: Career Planning and Development
Students will emerge from the major with realistic ideas about how to implement their psychological knowledge, skills, and val- ues in occupational pursuits in a variety of settings.
APA GUIDELINES FOR THE UNDERGRADUATE PSYCHOLOGY MAJOR
Learning Outcomes
Each of the 10 goals includes specific, numbered outcomes that articu- late suggested strategies for how the goals can be demonstrated. Each goal can be addressed in departments’ curriculum designs and assess- ment plans; however, departments may choose formally to emphasize selected goals and outcomes depending on their emphases, traditions, or resources. Separate subpoints for particular outcomes provide further assistance in developing performance expectations.
An emphasis on certain content areas included as part of the learning goals and outcomes should not be construed as dictating course require- ments. For example, the emphasis on the development of career skills
does not imply that these activities must transpire in a formal course on careers in psychology. Similarly, the Guidelines should not be interpreted as advocating that separate courses in the history of psychology or group dynamics be included in the undergraduate curriculum. Rather, these guidelines are intended to empower and encourage departments to determine contexts in which students can learn those relevant skills
and perspectives.

TO SLEER PERCFTANCE TO DREAM Ludy T. Benjamin, Jr.
There are probably more m5rths and misunderstandings about sleep and dreaming than about any other aspect of human behavior except sex.
For most people, sleep and dreamingwill occupy one third of their lives, yet few individuals are aware of even the most rudimentary information about this activity. For example, consider tJre following facts: Apparently everyone dreams; that i;, there are no nondreamers, only nonrecallers. In an 8-hour night of sleep most people will have from four to five dreams, usually on quite unrelated topics. The great majority of dreams are in color. Sleep leaming apparently does not occur. Dreams are not always filled with easily interpretable psychological meanings, as popular literature would have one believe.
The study of sleep and dreaming is still in its infancy. Most of what we know about this area is the result of research occurring in the last 25 years and is principally due to the development of electrophysiological techniques (particularly the electroencephalograph, or EEG) and the discovery, in 1953, of rapid eye movements (REMs) during sleep.
The purposes of this exercise are (a) to help students focus attention on their own sleep and dreaming patterns, (b) to generate data for class discussion, (c) to introduce students to the concept of data collection in sleep and dreaming, (d) to illustrate appropriate statistical measures for summarizing the data, and (e) to aid students in understanding the interpretation of data in general and these data in particular.
Pass out the "Sleep and Dreaming Record" to each student, providing multiple copies-one for each day that records will be kept (14 consecutive nights provides a good sample). Tell the students why the data are being collected and indicate that participation is voh:ntary. Explain that they can conceal their identity by marking their records with a number (six or seven digits in length) that they make up on their own. This procedure allows them to identify their statistics in reference to others in class when the srurunary data are provided later. Note that it takes only about 5 minutes each day to complete tlre record.
Ask all students to begrn their records on the same day and to keep their record sheets at home. Request ttrat during the time the records are being kept, discussion among students regarding their sleep and dreaming pattems be minimal to avoid unintentional influences on the data. Give explicit instructions on record keeping. (It is a good idea to have one "practice run" to insure that everyone understands the record- keeping system before continuing for 14 days.) The record provided is only a sample. Feel free to modify it as appropriate.
When the time period is completed and students have turned in all of their records, the tedious part begins for the fsagfrgl-ths

surnmarization of the data, for which a calculator is most helpful. Each student's records should be summarized separately, and data should be anaTyzedfor the group as a whole. A summary sheet for the students should then be prepared, which lists everyone who participated (by number) and provides the group analyses. For example, Student
# rcZAS+ can examine tl-rat column number of the summary sheet to find a mean sleep time of 7.3 hours (over 14 days), with a range of 5.6-9.7 hours. The student can then compare these figures with those of other students and with those for the class as a whole, based on the group data.

The data students generate will add considerable personal interest to the
topic of sleep and dreaming. Further, the statistical treatrnents will help them understand how data are summarized and analyzed to make them more meaningful. It might be usefi:l to save the summary statistics from classes for comparison with those of futwe classes.

Although it is not necessar5z, teachers may wish to provide some statistical measures of relationship between some of the variables for which they have collected data by using the technique of correlation. For example, is there a relationship betweenthe number of hours people sleep and tlre number of dreams theyr6call? Or is there a relationship between the subjective sleep qualityrating and the number of awakenings one exlrriences during the night? A number of correlational anal5rses can be computed to answpq these and other questions. To
compute tlrese values, a calculator id needed. Some calculators have a built-in correlation ftrnction; othenfise, the computational formula in Appendix A shor.rld be used. It is important to remember that correlation is a measure of the degree to which two variables are related and does not necessarily specify the natwe of tlre relationship.

            <Text>#### Possible Mod: Voting

I've left the issue of membership in the APA, and the right to vote on many of the main issues, intentionally vague. This is to allow for some flexibility for the instructor. The issue of who can practice mental health treatment is a game issue, realized in competing proposals in 1973.  As a corollary then, the issue of membership in the APA may be brought forward. This can also play out as one of the causes of the APA’s ‘fission' that may occur starting in 1975.

**Kameny**, **Gittings** and **Gold** are not members of the APA at the beginning of the game.  If the gamemaster wants everyone to vote, he or she should make clear from the beginning that they are considered to be members of the APA with full rights to vote.

References


Interpersonal dynamics in a prison environment are to be studied experimentally by designing a functional simulation of a prison in which subjects role-pay prisoners and guards for an extended period of time. To assess the power of the social forces on the emergent behavior in this situation, alternative explanations in terms of pre-existing dispositions are to be eliminated through subject selection. A homogeneous, “normal” sample is to be chosen after extensive interviewing and diagnostic testing of a large group of volunteer male college students. Half of the subjects are to be randomly assigned to role-play prison guards for eight hours each day, while the others role-play prisoners incarcerated for nearly one fill week. Neither group will receive any specific training in these roles. The primary investigator will role-play the prison warden, and consultants from the real prison population (both prisoners and prison officials) will be recruited to assist in the planning and implementation of the prison environment. 
Continuous, direct observation of behavioral interactions will be supplemented by video-taped recording, questionnaires, self-report scales and interviews. All these data sources are likely to converge on the conclusion that this simulated prison will develop into a psychologically compelling prison environment.

### Your Biography

You were born in 1936 in Brooklyn, New York. You earned your A.B. from Syracuse University in 1957, your MD from Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in 1961. At Johns Hopkins you studied with John Money, and continued to work with him throughout your career.

Money and you collaborated on a series of studies of so-called 'sissy boys' when you were still ABD starting in the 1960s. This collaboration has yielded a number of studies, including your recent paper “Mythological, historical, and cross-cultural aspects of transsexualism” which is included in your co-edited book Transsexualism and Sex Reassignment. Transsexualism has become your life-long research topic.

You are dissatisfied today with the state of the science of sexuality, in part because it is too dominated by theoretical positions and not by empirical research. Moreover, research into sexuality is conducted by individuals in many different disciplines, and there is no single organization or journal that can unify all the researchers from all these disciplines.

Your goal is to create an organization that can promote and defend the empirical, scientific study of sexuality in the U.S. and abroad.

### Game Objectives

You have a long-standing friendship with both Harold Lief and Diane Fordney-Settlage, support here when and where appropriate.

You should argued forcefully in favor of the removal of 'homosexuality' from the DSM. You argue that the grounds for deciding the issue should be the "historical and cross-cultural groundings in homosexual expression, associated psychiatric features accompanying a homosexual orientation, the emotional consequences to the homosexual of societal condemnation, and behaviors of other species."

You should oppose, however,  efforts of the Board of Directors to put it to a public vote, saying that such "a shotgun marriage between science and democracy" was "ludicrous." A true scientific principle, that is supported by data, need not have public support to be the right thing to do.

After the removal of homosexuality passes (however it passes), get on the Spitzer Taskforce to rewrite the DSM. You should adamantly oppose any efforts to reintroduce homosexuality—in any form—to the nomenclature. If Spitzer tries to introduce something like 'homodysphilia' or 'ego-dystonic homosexuality', resign from the task force in a grand, public way (like storming out of class).

*When, and if, the game reaches a point of trying to define mental illness*, you must pass a psychoanalytic interpretation of mental disorder / illness.

Propose a new journal titled *Archives of Sexual Behavior* to the Board in 1971. If they do not agree, create it when you create the the International Academy of Sex Research (IASR) in 1975.

*Fission:*

Found (with E. Hooker) the International Academy of Sex Research, and take the *Archives of Sexual Behavior* with you.

### Specific Assignments

Working with J. Speigel, petition the Board of Directors in 1971 to create a task force to conduct a historical survey and literature review on the Psychiatric and Psychological treatment of homosexuality. The task force should be be balanced between psychologists and psychiatrists, so you need a psychiatrist to support the effort – E. Hooker, G. Albee and John P. Spiegel are a good choices. Prepared to turn in a report by 1972.

Your report (due in 1972) should be titled “Homosexuality as Mental Illness,” and it should summarize the issues at stake in forthcoming debate, as well as cover the history of the classification of homosexuality by the psychological sciences. J. Speigel and you should co-author the report. You should invite responses to your paper from Socarides &amp; Beiber and Judd Marmor.

Biography
Judah (Judd) Marmor, M.D. (1910-2003) was an important Los Angeles psychiatrist and psychoanalyst, acknowledged for his leadership role in the movement to declassify homosexuality as a mental disease, which was removed from DSM-II in 1973.
Born on May 1, 1910 in London, England, Dr. Marmor grew up in Chicago and New York. He attended Columbia College as a Pulitzer scholar and graduated from the Columbia College of Physicians and Surgeons in 1933. Afterwards he began his postgraduate training in neurology and psychiatry and went into private psychiatric practice. Dr. Marmor began his psychoanalytic training four years later at the New York Psychoanalytic Institute in 1937.
After serving as a Senior Attending Surgeon (Lt.) in the Navy during WWII, Dr. Marmor and his wife Katherine moved to Los Angeles where he began as the Senior Attending Psychiatrist at Cedars of Lebanon Hospital in 1947. At this time he began visiting professorships in psychology and social welfare at the University of Southern California (USC) and the University of California, Los Angles (UCLA). In 1952, Dr. Marmor was appointed Clinical Professor of Psychiatry at the UCLA School of Medicine and a year later began as a Training Analyst for the Southern California Psychoanalytic Institute. In 1965 Dr. Marmor assumed the position of Director of the Division of Psychiatry at

 Cedars-Sinai Medical Center and in 1972 became the first Franz Alexander Professor of Psychiatry Chair at the USC School of Medicine.
Dr. Marmor rose to prominence early in his career in academic and professional psychiatric and psychoanalytic communities; he was known as a talented educator, prolific writer and a compassionate clinician. He was respected for his analytic work with Hollywood celebrities, his strong commitment to the civil and women's rights movements, and was also known to the public as Abigail Van Buren's mental health expert in "Dear Abby" advice columns.
Judd Marmor was also a leading figure in the movement to declassify homosexuality as a mental disease. Dr. Marmor worked for many years with homosexual patients beginning in the 1940s, and his first book Sexual Inversion and early publications regarding the subject were some of the first to feature biopsychosocial approaches to the issue of homosexuality. In 1967, Evelyn Hooker, chairwoman of the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) Task Force on Homosexuality, nominated Judd to be a member. The NIMH Task Force produced an influential final report two years later, the recommendations of which would have far-reaching effects for social policy, training, treatment, and government funded research.
From 1970 to 1973 annual APA conferences were disrupted by protests from gay activists. Shortly after Dr. John Fryer's now famous "Dr. H. Anonymous" presentation at the annual APA conference in Dallas in May of 1972, the Nomenclature Committee, Dr. Marmor then the Vice President and Dr. John P. Spiegel the President-elect of the APA met with gay activist groups to discuss the category of homosexuality as it appeared in the Diagnostics and Statistics Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM). In 1973, a DSM-II development committee led by Dr. Robert Spitzer put forth a vote to the APA Board of Trustees, and a year later the APA membership would vote to remove homosexuality from the DSM-II. Dr. Marmor had long been an outspoken critic of classifying homosexuality as a mental illness and was influential in many historic events that ended discrimination against homosexuals in the psychiatric community.
Dr. Marmor sat on numerous journal editorial boards and boards of directors, and was the president and/or vice-president of six professional medical organizations and societies; including the American Academy of Psychoanalysis, American Psychiatric Association, Group for the Advancement of Psychiatry, Southern California Psychoanalytic Institute, and Southern California Psychoanalytic Society. He was the principle author and editor of 8 books and over 350 scientific journal articles featuring a spectrum of psychiatric and psychoanalytic topics. Judd and his wife Katherine, a clinical psychologist, were also collectors of contemporary art. Both sat on the Contemporary Art Council board of directors at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA) and were known to have lent and donated artworks to LACMA and MOCA.
Dr. Marmor died on December 16, 2003 at the age of 93.

[UIENTAL ILLNESS James M. Gardner
We often make judgments about the behavior of other people, determining whether particular acts were or were not appropriate. Occasionallywe may even decide, based on our observations, *rat someone is "mentally ill." This exercise offers a classroom opportunity to study such attributions.
Ask for six volunteers to play roles in a skit. Take them out of the room and have them choose a role from six 3 x 5 inch cards bearing the following descriptions:
1. You are an escaped convict, previously convicted of murder. 2. You are a successful business executive whose spouse just
announced the existence of a love affair, whose child is in the hospital, and whose car broke down this moming.
3. You are married with two children and unemployed; you desperately need a job and are on your way to an interview.
4. You are on yourway to a sale.
5. You are lonely, have few friends, became bored watching TV, and are going somewhere just to have something to do.
6. You are waiting at the bus stop for the bus. Your role is to try to engage each of the waiting passengers in conversation so that the class can observe how they act. Some questions that you might ask are: Do you have the proper time? Does the bus usually run late?
While the actors study their roles, return to the room and instnrct the other students to observe closely the behavior of each actor. Bring in tlre actor who drew the sixth role-the catalyst. Then bring in the other actors one by one, and let them interact with the catalyst for about 1 minute each.
When the skit is over, have the actors return to their seats. On the chalkboard, set up a matrix with the names of the actors in a vertical column on the left; list them in any order, except put tlre catalyst's name last. Tell the class that the six actors were playing rolds, that you are going to list those roles across the top of tlre matrix, and tJlat you are going to poll the class to determine how many believe each actor could have been piaying each role. AIso tell them that you are going to include a role that no one played. Then list the roles one at a tjme, polling students on each one before you list the next. List the roles in the same order as they appear above, but insert "a mentally ill person" between the third and fourth roles.

 Discussion
Whenthe votingis completed, examine the data. First, determine

            <Text>#### Committee structure

The APA is overseen by a Board of Directors, which is responsible for maintaining the organization, and approving all official public proclamations and publications of the organization.  The president, who opens the conference with his or her presidential address, also serves as chair of the Board of Directors during that conference. The secretary of the Board of Directors is responsible for maintaining the minutes for that meeting and implementing whatever policy decisions are required.

In addition to the Board of Directors, there are currently three standing committees of the APA. All standing committees report directly to the Board of Directors annually.  All standing committees have the right to request an open session at the general conference for whatever they wish. If they want to initiate a vote by membership, however, they must file a request with the Board of Directors. If the Board of Directors approves the request, the standing committee can administer a vote.

##### Board of Directors:
**Responsibilities:**

* Issue public proclamations.
* Maintain official publications, such as the DSM
* Create ad-hoc committees and task forces, as necessary.
* Oversee and receive reports from the standing committees.

**Initial Membership:**

 The membership of the Board of Directors is:

\end{longtable}--&gt;

The Board of Directors is one of a handful of standing committees of the APA. Standing committees are permanent institutions, whose membership is elected by the membership at large. Ad hoc (literally 'after the fact') committees or 'task forces' are created by simple majority vote of the Board of Directors and are tasked with generating a report on a specific problem or area of research. Usually, these are formed when the Board of Directors believes it has inadequate information on a specific subject. For the purposes of this game, ad hoc committees will conduct literature reviews on behalf of the Board of Directors and report to the membership. Ad hoc committees disband after the report is accepted by the Board of Directors.  

The Board of Directors has the power to create ad hoc committees or task forces as it sees fit. The membership of those committees may be specified directly by the Board of Directors at the time of creation, left to the chair of the newly created committee to decide, or even determined by popular vote of the membership. That decision is left to the Board of Directors.

Unlike the creation of ad hoc committees or task forces, the creation of new permanent standing committees require a majority vote of the APA membership, not just the Board of Directors. A full proposal for such a committee, specifying its membership structure, voting procedures, rights and responsibilities should be distributed to the membership at least 48 hours before the vote. Dissolving a standing committee requires a majority vote of the membership.

The Board of Directors represents the membership, it does not act in opposition.  It is incredibly important, then, that the Board seeks approval from the membership as a whole at every turn.  The Board is a capable of assigning duties to various subcommittees on its own, but all matters of policy should be turned over to the membership for an up or down vote.

&lt;!--\newpage--&gt;

##### Research Committee

The research committee is charged with distributing grants to fund research as well as enforcing the APA's Ethical Standards in the practice of Psychology and Psychiatry (see &lt;!--\ref{app: APAEthics}--&gt;).

**Responsibilites**

* Solicit proposals in the form of a 'call for research grants'
* Award grants to those proposal it deems excellent
* Hearing and deciding on cases of research ethics

The Research committee should solicit proposals in the form of a 'Call for Research Grants' that specifies both the deadline for submissions, as well as the time frame for reviewing submissions. The Research Committee should revise the enclosed 'Call for Research Grants' on p. &lt;!--\pageref{callforresearchgrants}--&gt; to suit their needs.

In the context of the game, winning a grant entitles the bearer to access the student body for a period of one class session, during which time he or she can perform his or her approved research project. After that period, the grantee will be expected to present his or her findings to the membership as a conference paper / report.

The Research committee should take great care in considering the scientific value of each proposal. The APA does not want to be seen supporting poor or biased research! As such, members of the Research committee are strongly advised to carefully consult the ‘&lt;!--\ref{basicscientificresearch}--&gt;’ on p. &lt;!--\pageref{basicscientificresearch}--&gt;. as well as the '&lt;!--\ref{ethicsofhumanresearch}--&gt;., on p. &lt;!--\pageref{ethicsofhumanresearch}--&gt;. of the gamebook.

The Research committee is also charged with hearing and ultimately ruling on charges of ethical transgression. It alone has the power to censure a member of the APA. And because these powers apply equally to all members, including those sitting on the Board of Directors, this power can be exercised without approval by the Board of Directors.

 The Board of Directors should hold an election each year for a new member of the Research committee.  

**Initial membership**

Members of the Research committee in 1971:

* L. Tyler (expiring 1972)
* K. Clark (expiring 1973)
* J. Marmor (expiring 1974)

&lt;!--\newpage--&gt;

##### Nomenclature Committee

The Nomenclature committee is charged with maintaining the official terminology of psychology and psychiatry.  This is embodied by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, which is the definitive source for definitions and classifications of mental disorders.  

**Responsibilites**

* Maintain the official diagnostic and statistical manual of mental illness

It determines who can be diagnosed with what, what treatments are considered responsible and what disorders will be covered by medical insurance. If a condition does not appear in the DSM, psychiatrists cannot treat patients with that condition. Given the increasing importance of health insurance in the 1970s, it is vital to have a standardized diagnostic system to support billable treatments.

Members of the nomenclature committee serve for six years.

Members of the nomenclature committee are strongly advised to carefully consult the ‘&lt;!--\ref{historyofclassificationsofmentalillness}--&gt;,’ starting on p. &lt;!--\pageref{historyofclassificationsofmentalillness}--&gt;. of the gamebook.

** Initial Membership**

Members of the nomenclature committee in 1971:

* G. Albee (expiring 1972)
* J. Spiegel (expiring 1974)
* R. Spitzer (expiring 1976)

&lt;!--\newpage--&gt;

##### Program Committee

The Program Committee is charged with scheduling the conferences. 

**Responsibilites**

* Solicit proposals from the membership
* Create the schedule for each conference

The committee must remember that each conference opens with a public address from the sitting president, and each standing committee has the right to a session at each conference. Not all the standing committees will make use of that time, but each should be approached before the schedule is drawn up.

Proposals for symposia and presentations should be solicited from the general population. The committee meets in closed session (i.e. after class) to determine the conference schedule after reviewing all of the materials submitted. It is vitally important that the symposia and papers accepted represent the highest standard for academic work. They should be judged by that standard alone, not with respect to theoretical commitment or viewpoint. The conference schedule should be made available to the membership at least 48 hours before the conference begins (i.e. by Friday evening before a new conference).

The Program Committee is composed of three members, each of which serve three year terms. Hence, the Board of Directors must hold an election for a new member every year.

The schedule for the conference is set by the 'Program Committee', but there are a number of business events that must take place each year. These are outlined in &lt;!--\ref{sample: bod}--&gt;.

**Initial membership**

Program committee in 1971:

            <Text> The Effects of Segregation and the Consequences of Desegregation
A (September 1952) Social Science Statement
in the Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka Supreme Court Case
Kenneth B. Clark, Isidor Chein, and Stuart W. Cook
     The problem of the segregation of racial and ethnic groups constitutes one of the major problems facing the American people today. It seems desirable, therefore, to summarize the contributions which contem- porary social science can make toward its resolution. There are, of course, moral and legal issues involved with respect to which the signers of the present statement cannot speak with any special authority and which must be taken into account in the solution of the problem. There are, however, also factual issues involved with respect to which certain conclusions seem to be justified on the basis of the avail- able scientific evidence. It is with these issues only that this paper is concerned. Some of the issues have to do with the consequences of segregation, some with the problems of changing from segregated to unsegregated practices. These two groups of issues will be dealt with in separate sections below. It is necessary, first, however, to define and delimit the problem to be discussed.
Definitions
For purposes of the present statement, segregation refers to that restriction of opportunities for different types of asso- ciations between the members of one racial, religious, national or geographic origin, or linguistic group and those of other groups, which results from or is supported by the action of any official body or agency representing some branch of government. We are not here concerned with such segregation as arises from the free movements of individuals which are neither enforced nor supported by official bodies, nor with the segregation of criminals or of individuals with communicable diseases which aims at protecting society from those who might harm it.
Where the action takes place in a social milieu in which the groups involved do not enjoy equal social status, the group that is of lesser social status will be referred to as the segregated group.
In dealing with the question of the effects of segrega- tion, it must be recognized that these effects do not take place in a vacuum, but in a social context. The segregation of Negroes and of other groups in the United States takes place in a social milieu in which “race” prejudice and discrimination exist. It is questionable in the view of some

students of the problem whether it is possible to have segregation without substantial discrimination. Myrdal1 states: “Segregation . . . is financially possible and, indeed, a device of economy only as it is combined with substantial discrimination” (p. 629). The imbededness of segregation in such a context makes it difficult to disentangle the effects of segregation per se from the effects of the context. Similarly, it is difficult to disentangle the effects of segre- gation from the effects of a pattern of social disorganization commonly associated with it and reflected in high disease and mortality rates, crime and delinquency, poor housing, disrupted family life and general substandard living condi- tions. We shall, however, return to this problem after consideration of the observable effects of the total social complex in which segregation is a major component.
At the recent Mid-century White House Conference on Children and Youth, a fact-finding report on the effects of prejudice, discrimination and segregation on the person- ality development of children was prepared as a basis for some of the deliberations.2 This report brought together the available social science and psychological studies which were related to the problem of how racial and religious prejudices influenced the development of a healthy person- ality. It highlighted the fact that segregation, prejudices and discriminations, and their social concomitants potentially damage the personality of all children—the children of the majority group in a somewhat different way than the more obviously damaged children of the minority group.
The report indicates that as minority group children learn the inferior status to which they are assigned—as they

observe the fact that they are almost always segregated and kept apart from others who are treated with more respect by the society as a whole—they often react with feelings of inferiority and a sense of personal humiliation. Many of them become confused about their own personal worth. On the one hand, like all other human beings they require a sense of personal dignity; on the other hand, almost no- where in the larger society do they find their own dignity as human beings respected by others. Under these conditions, the minority group child is thrown into a conflict with regard to his feelings about himself and his group. He wonders whether his group and he himself are worthy of no more respect than they receive. This conflict and confusion leads to self-hatred and rejection of his own group.
The report goes on to point out that these children must find ways with which to cope with this conflict. Not every child, of course, reacts with the same patterns of behavior. The particular pattern depends upon many inter- related factors, among which are: the stability and quality of his family relations; the social and economic class to which he belongs; the cultural and educational background of his parents; the particular minority group to which he belongs; his personal characteristics, intelligence, special talents, and personality pattern.
Some children, usually of the lower socio-economic
classes, may react by overt aggressions and hostility di-
rected toward their own group or members of the dominant
3
group. Anti-social and delinquent behavior may often be
interpreted as reactions to these racial frustrations. These reactions are self-destructive in that the larger society not only punishes those who commit them, but often interprets such aggressive and anti-social behavior as justification for continuing prejudice and segregation.
Middle class and upper class minority group children are likely to react to their racial frustrations and conflicts by withdrawal and submissive behavior. Or, they may react with compensatory and rigid conformity to the prevailing middle class values and standards and an aggressive deter- mination to succeed in these terms in spite of the handicap of their minority status.
The report indicates that minority group children of all social and economic classes often react with a generally defeatist attitude and a lowering of personal ambitions. This, for example, is reflected in a lowering of pupil morale and a depression of the educational aspiration level among minority group children in segregated schools. In produc- ing such effects, segregated schools impair the ability of the child to profit from the educational opportunities pro- vided him.
Many minority group children of all classes also tend to be hypersensitive and anxious about their relations with the larger society. They tend to see hostility and rejection even in those areas where these might not actually exist.
The report concludes that while the range of individ- ual differences among members of a rejected minority group is as wide as among other peoples, the evidence suggests that all of these children are unnecessarily encum- bered in some ways by segregation and its concomitants.
With reference to the impact of segregation and its concomitants on children of the majority group, the report indicates that the effects are somewhat more obscure. Those children who learn the prejudices of our society are also being taught to gain personal status in an unrealistic and non-adaptive way. When comparing themselves to members of the minority group, they are not required to evaluate themselves in terms of the more basic standards of actual personal ability and achievement. The culture per- mits and, at times, encourages them to direct their feelings of hostility and aggression against whole groups of people the members of which are perceived as weaker than them- selves. They often develop patterns of guilt feelings, ratio- nalizations and other mechanisms which they must use in an attempt to protect themselves from recognizing the essential injustice of their unrealistic fears and hatreds of minority groups.4
The report indicates further that confusion, conflict, moral cynicism, and disrespect for authority may arise in majority group children as a consequence of being taught the moral, religious and democratic principles of the broth- erhood of man and the importance of justice and fair play by the same persons and institutions who, in their support of racial segregation and related practices, seem to be acting in a prejudiced and discriminatory manner. Some individuals may attempt to resolve this conflict by intensi- fying their hostility toward the minority group. Others may react by guilt feelings which are not necessarily reflected in more humane attitudes toward the minority group. Still others react by developing an unwholesome, rigid, and uncritical idealization of all authority figures—their par- ents, strong political and economic leaders. As described in The Authoritarian Personality,5 they despise the weak, while they obsequiously and unquestioningly conform to the demands of the strong whom they also, paradoxically, subconsciously hate.
With respect to the setting in which these difficulties
develop, the report emphasized the role of the home, the
6
school, and other social institutions. Studies have shown
that from the earliest school years children are not only aware of the status differences among different groups in the society but begin to react with the patterns described above.

Conclusions similar to those reached by the Mid- century White House Conference Report have been stated by other social scientists who have concerned themselves with this problem. The following are some examples of these conclusions:
Segregation imposes upon individuals a distorted
7 sense of social reality.
Segregation leads to a blockage in the communications
and interaction between the two groups. Such blockages tend
8 to increase mutual suspicion, distrust and hostility.
Segregation not only perpetuates rigid stereotypes and
reinforces negative attitudes toward members of the other
group, but also leads to the development of a social climate
within which violent outbreaks of racial tensions are likely
9 to occur.
We return now to the question, deferred earlier, of what it is about the total society complex of which segre- gation is one feature that produces the effects described above—or, more precisely, to the question of whether we can justifiably conclude that, as only one feature of a complex social setting, segregation is in fact a significantly contributing factor to these effects.
To answer this question, it is necessary to bring to bear the general fund of psychological and sociological knowledge concerning the role of various environmental influences in producing feelings of inferiority, confusions in personal roles, various types of basic personality struc- tures and the various forms of personal and social disorganization.
On the basis of this general fund of knowledge, it seems likely that feelings of inferiority and doubts about personal worth are attributable to living in an underprivi- leged environment only insofar as the latter is itself per- ceived as an indicator of low social status and as a symbol of inferiority. In other words, one of the important deter- minants in producing such feelings is the awareness of social status difference. While there are many other factors that serve as reminders of the differences in social status, there can be little doubt that the fact of enforced segrega-
10 tion is a major factor.
This seems to be true for the following reasons among others: (1) because enforced segregation results from the decision of the majority group without the consent of the segregated and is commonly so perceived; and (2) because historically segregation patterns in the United States were developed on the assumption of the inferiority of the segregated.
In addition, enforced segregation gives official recog- nition and sanction to these other factors of the social complex, and thereby enhances the effects of the latter in creating the awareness of social status differences and
11
feelings of inferiority. The child who, for example, is
compelled to attend a segregated school may be able to

cope with ordinary expressions of prejudice by regarding the prejudiced person as evil or misguided; but he cannot readily cope with symbols of authority, the full force of the authority of the State—the school or the school board, in this instance—in the same manner. Given both the ordinary expression of prejudice and the school’s policy of segre- gation, the former takes on greater force and seemingly becomes an official expression of the latter.
Not all of the psychological traits which are com- monly observed in the social complex under discussion can be related so directly to the awareness of status differenc- es—which in turn is, as we have already noted, materially contributed to by the practices of segregation. Thus, the low level of aspiration and defeatism so commonly ob- served in segregated groups is undoubtedly related to the level of self-evaluation; but it is also, in some measure, related among other things to one’s expectations with re- gard to opportunities for achievement and, having achieved, to the opportunities for making use of these achievements. Similarly, the hypersensitivity and anxiety displayed by many minority group children about their relations with the larger society probably reflects their awareness of status differences; but it may also be influ- enced by the relative absence of opportunities for equal status contact which would provide correctives for prevail- ing unrealistic stereotypes.
The preceding view is consistent with the opinion stated by a large majority (90%) of social scientists who replied to a questionnaire concerning the probable effects of enforced segregation under conditions of equal facilities. This opinion was that, regardless of the facilities which are provided, enforced segregation is psychologically detri-
12 mental to the members of the segregated group.
Similar considerations apply to the question of what features of the social complex of which segregation is a part contribute to the development of the traits which have been observed in majority group members. Some of these are probably quite closely related to the awareness of status differences, to which, as has already been pointed out, segregation makes a material contribution. Others have a more complicated relationship to the total social setting. Thus, the acquisition of an unrealistic basis for self-evalu- ation as a consequence of majority group membership probably reflects fairly closely the awareness of status differences. On the other hand, unrealistic fears and hatreds of minority groups, as in the case of the converse phenom-

enon among minority group members, are probably signif- icantly influenced as well by the lack of opportunities for equal status contact.
With reference to the probable effects of segregation
under conditions of equal facilities on majority group mem-
bers, many of the social scientists who responded to the
poll in the survey cited above felt that the evidence is less
convincing than with regard to the probable effects of such
segregation on minority group members, and the effects are
possibly less widespread. Nonetheless, more than 80%
stated it as their opinion that the effects of such segregation
are psychologically detrimental to the majority group
13 members.
It may be noted that many of these social scientists supported their opinions on the effects of segregation on both majority and minority groups by reference to one or another or to several of the following four lines of pub-
14
lished and unpublished evidence. First, studies of chil-
dren throw light on the relative priority of the awareness of status differentials and related factors as compared to the awareness of differences in facilities. On this basis, it is possible to infer some of the consequences of segregation as distinct from the influence of inequalities of facilities. Second, clinical studies and depth interviews throw light on the genetic sources and causal sequences of various pat- terns of psychological reaction; and, again, certain infer- ences are possible with respect to the effects of segregation per se. Third, there actually are some relevant but relatively rare instances of segregation with equal or even superior facilities, as in the cases of certain Indian reservations. Fourth, since there are inequalities of facilities in racially and ethnically homogeneous groups, it is possible to infer the kinds of effects attributable to such inequalities in the absence of effects of segregation and, by a kind of subtrac- tion to estimate the effects of segregation per se in situa- tions where one finds both segregation and unequal facilities.
Segregation is at present a social reality. Questions may be raised, therefore, as to what are the likely conse- quences of desegregation.
One such question asks whether the inclusion of an intellectually inferior group may jeopardize the education of the more intelligent group by lowering educational stan- dards or damage the less intelligent group by placing it in a situation where it is at a marked competitive disadvan- tage. Behind this question is the assumption, which is examined below, that the presently segregated groups ac- tually are inferior intellectually.
The available scientific evidence indicates that much, perhaps all, of the observable differences among various racial and national groups may be adequately explained in
15
terms of environmental differences. It has been found, for
instance, that the differences between the average intelli-
gence test scores of Negro and white children decrease, and
the overlap of the distributions increases, proportionately to
the number of years that the Negro children have lived in
16
the North. Related studies have shown that this change
cannot be explained by the hypothesis of selective migra-
17
tion. It seems clear, therefore, that fears based on the
assumption of innate racial differences in intelligence are not well founded.
It may also be noted in passing that the argument regarding the intellectual inferiority of one group as com- pared to another is, as applied to schools, essentially an argument for homogeneous groupings of children by intel- ligence rather than by race. Since even those who believe that there are innate differences between Negroes and whites in America in average intelligence grant that con- siderable overlap between the two groups exists, it would follow that it may be expedient to group together the superior whites and Negroes, the average whites and Ne- groes, and so on. Actually, many educators have come to doubt the wisdom of class groupings made homogeneous solely on the basis of intelligence.18 Those who are op- posed to such homogeneous grouping believe that this type of segregation, too, appears to create generalized feelings of inferiority in the child who attends a below average class, leads to undesirable emotional consequences in the education of the gifted child, and reduces learning oppor- tunities which result from the interaction of individuals with varied gifts.
A second problem that comes up in an evaluation of the possible consequences of desegregation involves the question of whether segregation prevents or stimulates interracial tension and conflict and the corollary question of whether desegregation has one or the other effect.
The most direct evidence available on this problem comes from observations and systematic study of instances in which desegregation has occurred. Comprehensive re-
19
views of such instances clearly establish the fact that
desegregation has been carried out successfully in a variety of situations although outbreaks of violence had been com- monly predicted. Extensive desegregation has taken place without major incidents in the armed services in both Northern and Southern installations and involving officers and enlisted men from all parts of the country, including

the South.20 Similar changes have been noted in housing21
22
and industry. During the last war, many factories both in
the North and South hired Negroes on a non-segregated, non-discriminatory basis. While a few strikes occurred, refusal by management and unions to yield quelled all
23 strikes within a few days.
Relevant to this general problem is a comprehensive study of urban race riots which found that race riots oc- curred in segregated neighborhoods, whereas there was no violence in sections of the city where the two races lived, worked and attended school together.24
Under certain circumstances desegregation not only proceeds without major difficulties, but has been observed to lead to the emergence of more favorable attitudes and friendlier relations between races. Relevant studies may be
25 26
cited with respect to housing, employment, the armed
27 28 29 services and merchant marine, recreation agency, and
30 general community life.
Much depends, however, on the circumstances under which members of previously segregated groups first come in contact with others in unsegregated situations. Available evidence suggests, first, that there is less likelihood of unfriendly relations when the change is simultaneously introduced into all units of a social institution to which it is applicable— e.g., all of the schools in a school system or all
31
of the shops in a given factory. When factories introduced
Negroes in only some shops but not in others the prejudiced workers tended to classify the desegregated shops as infe- rior, “Negro work.” Such objections were not raised when complete integration was introduced.
The available evidence also suggests the importance
of consistent and firm enforcement of the new policy by
32
those in authority. It indicates also the importance of such
factors as: the absence of competition for a limited number
33
of facilities or benefits; the possibility of contacts which
permit individuals to learn about one another as individu-
34
als; and the possibility of equivalence of positions and
functions among all of the participants within the unsegre- gated situation.35 These conditions can generally be satis- fied in a number of situations, as in the armed services, public housing developments, and public schools.
The problem with which we have here attempted to deal is admittedly on the frontiers of scientific knowledge. Inevitably, there must be some differences of opinion among us concerning the conclusiveness of certain items of evidence, and concerning the particular choice of words and placement of emphasis in the preceding statement. We are nonetheless in agreement that this statement is substan- tially correct and justified by the evidence, and the differ- ences among us, if any, are of a relatively minor order and would not materially influence the preceding conclusions.

This activity is a good "opener" to get students to pay attention and talk. The materials are readily available, and once you have them, there is no advance prepiiation. The music from the movie )aws could be replaced by music from any currcntthriller, with appropriate modifications in imagery. No prior knowledge of psychol- ogy is necessary, and the activity is suitable for classes of all sizes.

The concept of classical conditioning is often difficult for students to grasp if the instructor immediately begins to use the time-honored example of Pavlov and his dogs. The students may get lost in the maze of terms-Us, UR, CR, CS-and fail to see any relevance between slobbering dogs and human leaming. Thus I think that it is important to begin a presentation of classical conditioning with a real-life example that most students have experienced.
You will need a tape recording of a few seconds of the shark-attack music from the movie /aws.
I use this demonstration at the beginning of the section on conditioning in general psychology classes before I introduce the concepts. First I ask students to close their eyes and engage in mental imagery. I tell them to imagine that it is a hot summer day and that they are at the beach. The sun is scorching. They are getting hotter and hotter, can stand it no longer, run toward the ocean, and splash in the shallow water. Then they swim out to deeper water and enjoy cooling off after being in the sun. It is fairly easy to stretch this imagery process out for 2 or 3 minutes. Then, as unobtrusively as possible, I start the music ftom [aws. From the expressions on their faces and the laughter, I can tell immediately that most students have seen /aws and have been conditioned to associate the killer shark with the music.
The key part of the demonstration is the discussion that follows. Without knowing the appropriate classical conditioning terms/ students are able to explain in their own words what happened during the movie. They can tell you that the shark (technically a CS, but a US in this demonstration) yields a response of fear or disgust (the UR). They know that the music (CS) originally had no meaning but came to elicit a response (CR) during the movie because it signaled that the shark was about to appear and have a swimmer for lunch. At this point, they are prepared to hear your discussion on Pav-

lov's experiment, to understand it and the terminology used and to see the application of classical conditioning to human behavior. As you go on tJrrough the classical con- ditioning information/ youran point out that you actually demonstrated second-order conditioning to $-rem, because their responses to a shark are leamed through classical conditioning since they associate sharks with mutilation, blood, death, and so forth. All in all, the demonstration helps to bring classical conditioning and its principles to life in a highly relevant situati,on.

            <Title>Definitions used by the APA</Title>
            <Text>### Definitions used by the APA

The following are quoted from current websites of the American Psychological Association and the American Psychiatric Association.

#### Definition of "psychologist"

APA policy on the use of the title "psychologist" is contained in the General Guidelines for Providers of Psychological Services, which define the term "Professional Psychologist" as follows:

&gt;Psychologists have a doctoral degree in psychology from an organized, sequential program in a regionally accredited university or professional school.

The APA is not responsible for the specific title or wording of any particular position opening, but it is general pattern to refer to master's-level positions as counselors, specialists, clinicians, and so forth (rather than as "psychologists"). In addition, it is general practice to refer to APA accredited programs as "APA-accredited" rather than "APA approved." The position as described must be in conformity with the statute regulating the use of the title psychologist and the practice of psychology in the state in which the job is available.

#### Definition of "psychology"

Psychology is the study of the mind and behavior. The discipline embraces all aspects of the human experience — from the functions of the brain to the actions of nations, from child development to care for the aged. In every conceivable setting from scientific research centers to mental health care services, "the understanding of behavior" is the enterprise of psychologists.

#### Definition of “psychiatrist”

A psychiatrist is a physician who specializes in the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of mental illnesses and substance use disorders. It takes many years of education and training to become a psychiatrist: He or she must graduate from college and then medical school, and go on to complete four years of residency training in the field of psychiatry. (Many psychiatrists undergo additional training so that they can further specialize in such areas as child and adolescent psychiatry, geriatric psychiatry, forensic psychiatry, psychopharmacology, and/or psychoanalysis.) This extensive medical training enables the psychiatrist to understand the body's functions and the complex relationship between emotional illness and other medical illnesses. The psychiatrist is thus the mental health professional and physician best qualified to distinguish between physical and psychological causes of both mental and physical distress.

Your Biography
You are Robert Hopcke. Your character is actually a bit of a historical anachronism.  
The other characters in this game are were actually around in the early 1970s, typically in their 40's and 50's at the time. You were not. In fact, your first book doesn't appear until 1989. That means that today, in 2011, you are active in psychoanalytic circles.  Your autobiography is available online at http://www.robhopcke.com/MyProfessionalExperience.en.html. I'll quote the summary here:
I have two degrees in counseling: a Master of Arts in Theology, with a Pastoral Counseling emphasis, from Pacific Lutheran Theological Seminary, which is the degree under which I received my Marriage and Family Therapist license in 1986, and a second Master of Arts in Clinical Counseling from California State University, Hayward (now Cal State East Bay). My background encompasses a number of different models and approaches.  I am most known for being a Jungian-oriented therapist but also important to my professional identity has been formal training in pastoral counseling and spiritual direction, long-term object-relations psychodynamic treatment, cognitive-behavioral approaches to depression, health and sexuality concerns, and many years of being an "out" gay male therapist and activist in the Bay Area GLBT community. I am a best-selling author, public speaker, teacher, supervisor and professional consultant.
We've included you in the game to voice a gay-positive Jungian perspective. Jung, himself,  was not very gay-friendly. And those who follow his theory strictly continued that tradition throughout the 1970’s.  Thus, in order to find a gay-positive Jungian, we have to break the historical accuracy of the game. As a matter of actual history, you didn't publish this perspective on Jungian psychology until the late 1980's, but that's not important here.

Working with your fellow psychiatrists (MD's), create a proposal to limit the treatment of the mentally ill to medical doctors.  This should be presented in 1972. Expect a furious response from Albee, and maybe even Szasz.  You may choose to work out a compromise with Albee via E. Hooker, who, like you, has multiple degrees.
Your role in this game is to represent the aspect of the Jungian psychoanalytic tradition that was friendly to homosexuals. Jung himself was not.  Your primary work has been to reformulate a version of Jungian theory that is consistent with the new taxonomy of sexuality in the DSM. You should present that vision as a paper in 1975.
You should oppose any attempt to remove psychoanalytic language or categories from the DSM. At the same time, you should make sure that the Jungian perspective is protected in the manual.
When, and if, the game reaches a point of trying to define mental illness, you must pass a psychoanalytic interpretation of mental disorder / illness.

            <Title>Clark-1958-AQuestionOfValues</Title>
            <Text> A Question of Values
Having read K. E. Clark's America's Psychologists and the recent statement by Division 12 of the new requirement for fellowship status of "a significant con- tribution," we were impressed with the fact that either intentionally or unintentionally values are playing an increasingly significant role in determining the criteria which will be selected as appropriate for assessing the status of professional psychologists.
It is interesting to note in this connection that in Clark's book much emphasis is given to research publi- cation as a means of differentiating "significant con- tributors" from their ostensibly less productive col- leagues. It is apparent that discrimination on this basis has the advantages of objectivity and ease of determi- nation. There are certainly other equally important criteria, however difficult to measure, which the clinical psychologist might suggest: such as skill in diagnosis and therapy, number of patients benefited through treat- ment, direct and indirect contributions to the solution of mental hygiene problems in the community. The teacher of psychology would, we think, have still other pertinent criteria which he might consider of major import: such as the number of students toward whose education he has substantially contributed, the number of students he has motivated to pursue further study in psychology, and contributions to mental health through informal counseling.
The point we are trying to make is that a value system to a large extent determines what functions or productions are to be considered worthy and thus tends to sustain them. It should be remembered that Clark's book addresses itself, not only to research psychologists, but to the entire profession as well as to any other in- terested intelligent reader. Surely some consideration could have been given to other professional endeavors which are of significance to a large number of psychol- ogists. It is recognized that Clark and his co-workers cannot be criticized for delimiting their area of inves- tigation; but, if the book is intended to present infor- mation about all of America's psychologists, then errors of omission can loom as large as errors of commission. Clark himself reports that about three times as many psychologists are members of Division 12 than any other division. Might not some valuable hypotheses, amenable to research investigation, have been forthcom- ing from this large group as well as from the smaller number of psychology teachers? And what about prob- lems that appear significant for which no appropriate methodology currently exists? These oversights or neglect trouble us. We see it as a sign of things to
**
come; perhaps, the structure of the APA may be seri- ously threatened.
Even Division 12 seems to be suffering from this same (unrecognized?) conflict. New fellows will have to have made an "outstanding contribution" to psychology. Will these contributions be limited to those which can be reliably and validly investigated, leaving the impor- tant service and teaching functions to be relegated to secondary importance because of the difficulty in estab- lishing valid criteria for their assessment? Or is it to be a long list of (significant?) publications that will be the summum bonum? Was it W. S. Maugham in his Summing Up who said that writing a book was inher- ently no more valuable an activity than plowing a field? The value lies in the eyes of the doer (and perhaps in the contribution to others).
We might add that this question of values pervades many diverse areas in psychology, including psycho- metric assessment and teaching. In "Comments on Meehl and Rosen's Paper" (Psychol. Bull., 19S6, 53, 335-337) by S. Karson and S. B. Sells, essentially the same problem was raised. Certain remarks by S. L. Pressey in "Teaching in the Ivory Tower, with Rarely a Step Outside" (Psychol. Bull, 1955, 52, 343-344) are especially relevant. Although his plea is for a wider range of experiment in teaching evaluation studies, his words (p. 344) are noteworthy:
Climb higher in the ivory tower! Why not instead come down and open the door, watch what students do outside class, see what psychologists are doing in the wide world, and even venture off campus occasionally, to mix with the folks on Main Street.

A Reply
The comments of Karson, Baler, and Carroll suggest that the planning of the program of research reported in America's Psychologists intentionally or unintention- ally was influenced by value judgments. What they mean to say, obviously, is that they believe the wrong values were assigned, especially in the study of factors influencing an individual psychologist's research contri- butions to psychology. I gather that Karson, Baler, and Carroll would rather have had us study the contri- bution of individual psychologists to the solution of individual and society problems. I would like to see somebody make such a study; I do no.t believe Amer- ica's Psychologists should be criticized for having done

a different type of study than this, nor should it be concluded that we avoided use of clinical criteria simply because they were too difficult to assess.
The emphasis given to research publication, to which Karson, Baler, and Carroll object, occurred in our study of the way in which significant contributors dif- fered from their less productive colleagues. Attention to publication was essential, we felt, since any contri- bution to science necessarily involves comunication with one's fellows about results. The service a therapist gives to his client may be a great contribution to the
America's Psychologists did give consideration to other professional endeavors. One chapter deals with the comparative characteristics of clinical psychologists and of psychologists in other areas of specialization. Another includes a survey of private practice in clin- ical psychology in Los Angeles. Both of these studies involve no evaluation of the individual clinician, but still provide useful insights into the nature of contribu- tions being made by these persons.
Of course, we were dealing with values in making decisions about the way to proceed in the study of client, but it is not communicated to other psychol- American psychology. Our responsibility was to rec-
ogists. Likewise, the therapist may gain great skill in ognize what values we held and to make them explicit
his work and become an exceedingly capable person; but, unless he has some method, either in the training of others or through his writing, to convey what he has learned to his colleagues, he has not made a contribu- tion to psychology. Our study included in the signifi- cant contributor group a substantial number of clinical psychologists. These persons might have been nom- inated either because of their writing or because of the substantial training programs they directed for clinical psychologists, but not solely because they were excel- lent therapists. Note our directions to raters:
One of the studies being conducted under Project B is an investigation of factors influencing the productivity of research psychologists. Part of this study involves the de- velopment of a small sample of persons considered by their colleagues to have made significant research contributions in psychology, either through their own original work, or through their part in training research workers, this sample to be drawn from a larger roster of persons who have be- come "visible" to their colleagues through substantial con- tributions to the research literature. . . .
You are asked to nominate those persons whom you con- sider to have made the most significant contributions to psychology as a science, cither through scientific work of their own, or through their work in the training of research psychologists.
in our account. What these values were is revealed to any careful reader through the detailed procedures em- ployed in our study. In this respect, our study is no different from any other experimental investigation. While we were not willing to stop with a study that directed its attention only toward the characteristics of research psychologists, we did feel that they deserved primary attention, since the field of psychology can grow and develop only with a continuing increment to knowledge. Many clinical psychologists do not make contributions to science as science is normally defined; that they do make contributions is recognized by all.
I think we need to recognize that all of American psychology is today perplexed about the relative values to assign to research and to service in our growing field. Karson, Baler, and Carroll protest that decisions are being made about the desired characteristics of a clin- ical psychologist on traditional bases without enough attention being given to changing conditions and new roles played by clinical psychologists. For this posi- tion I think they can find full and unqualified support in America's Psychologists.

This activity does not require prior knowledge of psychology. There is little advance preparation, and it is suitable for c/asses of virtually any size. You will need to give some thought to how you will instruct the
"experimenter(s)" in the procedures without informing the learnels) during this in-class exercise.
CotlctPr
Human operant conditioning is often demonstrated by asking the subject to say nouns and then rein{orcing the plural but not the singular form. Another technique is to ask the subject to say numbers and then reinforce those numbers divisible by 2. The short- coming of these procedures is that the subject is limited by the instructions to two classes of responses, whereas the animal in the typical Skinner box can make many more different responses even if the space is limited. In addition, the procedures do not display shaping of the response by successive approximation, and as a consequence, there are no changes in the criteria for reinforcement that are present in shaping. Moteover, during extinction, one cannot watch the behavior revert to previously re- warded responses. These shortcomings can be minimized by doing the activity out-
lined here.
No materials are required except pencil and paper. Score sheets must be constructed by those doing the rein{orcing.
Twelve words are shown to the subject, and his or her instructions are simply to try to get as many points as possible. He or she is to say the word, and following the word the experimenter will say either "Point" or "No point." The experimenter should record which word was given and whether a reinforcement was given for each trial. The words to be used are underfed, misread, understand, underctudy, mistake, mistead, underctanding, mistaken, underpaid, underctandingly, misinform, and mistakenly.
The experimenter first reinJorces any word that begins with "mis," by saying "Point." Once the subject has picked three words in succession that begin with the syllable "mis" and received three reinforcements in succession, the experimenter should change the criterion so that-rein{orcement is received only if the first two syilables "mistake . ." ate chosen., Again, after the subject has received three rein- forcements in succession, the criterion is changed so that only the word with the three syllables "mistaken . ." is reinforced. AJter three more successive reinforcements/ only the word "mistakenly" is reinJorced. After five correct responses in succession, the reinforcement is no longer given for any word, thus beginning the extinction proc- ess. The extinction session should last at least three minutes.
LEARNING AND MEMORY r67
Mlrrntlls Nrroro
lxstnucrrors
 Drscussrol
The students can work in pairs, with one as the subject and one as the erperi- menter, or one student can be used to demonstrate the phenomena. Ask the subiect to pick his or her words by number, because that will facilitate recording the responses. Ir order to draw a cumulative response cunre, it is necessary to have someone record how many cofiect responses occur in each 3-minute period.
Once the cumulative response eurves for acquisition and extinction have been drawn, have students make observations on the rate of responding (indicated by the slopet. You might dsk them to try to specify what a reacquisition curve might look like or.a curve showing spontaneorii' recovery. If a number of subiects are conditioned then individual differences in rate will occur, so you may wish to ask what is it about the behavior in the situation that might account for such individual differences. The re- gression back through previously reinforced responses that is often observed in ani- mals may also occur. Ask the class how such behavior-going back through previously reinforced responses-might be adaptive for an animal in its natural environment.

            <Text> The Effects of Segregation and the Consequences of Desegregation
A (September 1952) Social Science Statement
in the Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka Supreme Court Case
Kenneth B. Clark, Isidor Chein, and Stuart W. Cook
     The problem of the segregation of racial and ethnic groups constitutes one of the major problems facing the American people today. It seems desirable, therefore, to summarize the contributions which contem- porary social science can make toward its resolution. There are, of course, moral and legal issues involved with respect to which the signers of the present statement cannot speak with any special authority and which must be taken into account in the solution of the problem. There are, however, also factual issues involved with respect to which certain conclusions seem to be justified on the basis of the avail- able scientific evidence. It is with these issues only that this paper is concerned. Some of the issues have to do with the consequences of segregation, some with the problems of changing from segregated to unsegregated practices. These two groups of issues will be dealt with in separate sections below. It is necessary, first, however, to define and delimit the problem to be discussed.
Definitions
For purposes of the present statement, segregation refers to that restriction of opportunities for different types of asso- ciations between the members of one racial, religious, national or geographic origin, or linguistic group and those of other groups, which results from or is supported by the action of any official body or agency representing some branch of government. We are not here concerned with such segregation as arises from the free movements of individuals which are neither enforced nor supported by official bodies, nor with the segregation of criminals or of individuals with communicable diseases which aims at protecting society from those who might harm it.
Where the action takes place in a social milieu in which the groups involved do not enjoy equal social status, the group that is of lesser social status will be referred to as the segregated group.
In dealing with the question of the effects of segrega- tion, it must be recognized that these effects do not take place in a vacuum, but in a social context. The segregation of Negroes and of other groups in the United States takes place in a social milieu in which “race” prejudice and discrimination exist. It is questionable in the view of some

students of the problem whether it is possible to have segregation without substantial discrimination. Myrdal1 states: “Segregation . . . is financially possible and, indeed, a device of economy only as it is combined with substantial discrimination” (p. 629). The imbededness of segregation in such a context makes it difficult to disentangle the effects of segregation per se from the effects of the context. Similarly, it is difficult to disentangle the effects of segre- gation from the effects of a pattern of social disorganization commonly associated with it and reflected in high disease and mortality rates, crime and delinquency, poor housing, disrupted family life and general substandard living condi- tions. We shall, however, return to this problem after consideration of the observable effects of the total social complex in which segregation is a major component.
At the recent Mid-century White House Conference on Children and Youth, a fact-finding report on the effects of prejudice, discrimination and segregation on the person- ality development of children was prepared as a basis for some of the deliberations.2 This report brought together the available social science and psychological studies which were related to the problem of how racial and religious prejudices influenced the development of a healthy person- ality. It highlighted the fact that segregation, prejudices and discriminations, and their social concomitants potentially damage the personality of all children—the children of the majority group in a somewhat different way than the more obviously damaged children of the minority group.
The report indicates that as minority group children learn the inferior status to which they are assigned—as they

observe the fact that they are almost always segregated and kept apart from others who are treated with more respect by the society as a whole—they often react with feelings of inferiority and a sense of personal humiliation. Many of them become confused about their own personal worth. On the one hand, like all other human beings they require a sense of personal dignity; on the other hand, almost no- where in the larger society do they find their own dignity as human beings respected by others. Under these conditions, the minority group child is thrown into a conflict with regard to his feelings about himself and his group. He wonders whether his group and he himself are worthy of no more respect than they receive. This conflict and confusion leads to self-hatred and rejection of his own group.
The report goes on to point out that these children must find ways with which to cope with this conflict. Not every child, of course, reacts with the same patterns of behavior. The particular pattern depends upon many inter- related factors, among which are: the stability and quality of his family relations; the social and economic class to which he belongs; the cultural and educational background of his parents; the particular minority group to which he belongs; his personal characteristics, intelligence, special talents, and personality pattern.
Some children, usually of the lower socio-economic
classes, may react by overt aggressions and hostility di-
rected toward their own group or members of the dominant
3
group. Anti-social and delinquent behavior may often be
interpreted as reactions to these racial frustrations. These reactions are self-destructive in that the larger society not only punishes those who commit them, but often interprets such aggressive and anti-social behavior as justification for continuing prejudice and segregation.
Middle class and upper class minority group children are likely to react to their racial frustrations and conflicts by withdrawal and submissive behavior. Or, they may react with compensatory and rigid conformity to the prevailing middle class values and standards and an aggressive deter- mination to succeed in these terms in spite of the handicap of their minority status.
The report indicates that minority group children of all social and economic classes often react with a generally defeatist attitude and a lowering of personal ambitions. This, for example, is reflected in a lowering of pupil morale and a depression of the educational aspiration level among minority group children in segregated schools. In produc- ing such effects, segregated schools impair the ability of the child to profit from the educational opportunities pro- vided him.
Many minority group children of all classes also tend to be hypersensitive and anxious about their relations with the larger society. They tend to see hostility and rejection even in those areas where these might not actually exist.
The report concludes that while the range of individ- ual differences among members of a rejected minority group is as wide as among other peoples, the evidence suggests that all of these children are unnecessarily encum- bered in some ways by segregation and its concomitants.
With reference to the impact of segregation and its concomitants on children of the majority group, the report indicates that the effects are somewhat more obscure. Those children who learn the prejudices of our society are also being taught to gain personal status in an unrealistic and non-adaptive way. When comparing themselves to members of the minority group, they are not required to evaluate themselves in terms of the more basic standards of actual personal ability and achievement. The culture per- mits and, at times, encourages them to direct their feelings of hostility and aggression against whole groups of people the members of which are perceived as weaker than them- selves. They often develop patterns of guilt feelings, ratio- nalizations and other mechanisms which they must use in an attempt to protect themselves from recognizing the essential injustice of their unrealistic fears and hatreds of minority groups.4
The report indicates further that confusion, conflict, moral cynicism, and disrespect for authority may arise in majority group children as a consequence of being taught the moral, religious and democratic principles of the broth- erhood of man and the importance of justice and fair play by the same persons and institutions who, in their support of racial segregation and related practices, seem to be acting in a prejudiced and discriminatory manner. Some individuals may attempt to resolve this conflict by intensi- fying their hostility toward the minority group. Others may react by guilt feelings which are not necessarily reflected in more humane attitudes toward the minority group. Still others react by developing an unwholesome, rigid, and uncritical idealization of all authority figures—their par- ents, strong political and economic leaders. As described in The Authoritarian Personality,5 they despise the weak, while they obsequiously and unquestioningly conform to the demands of the strong whom they also, paradoxically, subconsciously hate.
With respect to the setting in which these difficulties
develop, the report emphasized the role of the home, the
6
school, and other social institutions. Studies have shown
that from the earliest school years children are not only aware of the status differences among different groups in the society but begin to react with the patterns described above.

Conclusions similar to those reached by the Mid- century White House Conference Report have been stated by other social scientists who have concerned themselves with this problem. The following are some examples of these conclusions:
Segregation imposes upon individuals a distorted
7 sense of social reality.
Segregation leads to a blockage in the communications
and interaction between the two groups. Such blockages tend
8 to increase mutual suspicion, distrust and hostility.
Segregation not only perpetuates rigid stereotypes and
reinforces negative attitudes toward members of the other
group, but also leads to the development of a social climate
within which violent outbreaks of racial tensions are likely
9 to occur.
We return now to the question, deferred earlier, of what it is about the total society complex of which segre- gation is one feature that produces the effects described above—or, more precisely, to the question of whether we can justifiably conclude that, as only one feature of a complex social setting, segregation is in fact a significantly contributing factor to these effects.
To answer this question, it is necessary to bring to bear the general fund of psychological and sociological knowledge concerning the role of various environmental influences in producing feelings of inferiority, confusions in personal roles, various types of basic personality struc- tures and the various forms of personal and social disorganization.
On the basis of this general fund of knowledge, it seems likely that feelings of inferiority and doubts about personal worth are attributable to living in an underprivi- leged environment only insofar as the latter is itself per- ceived as an indicator of low social status and as a symbol of inferiority. In other words, one of the important deter- minants in producing such feelings is the awareness of social status difference. While there are many other factors that serve as reminders of the differences in social status, there can be little doubt that the fact of enforced segrega-
10 tion is a major factor.
This seems to be true for the following reasons among others: (1) because enforced segregation results from the decision of the majority group without the consent of the segregated and is commonly so perceived; and (2) because historically segregation patterns in the United States were developed on the assumption of the inferiority of the segregated.
In addition, enforced segregation gives official recog- nition and sanction to these other factors of the social complex, and thereby enhances the effects of the latter in creating the awareness of social status differences and
11
feelings of inferiority. The child who, for example, is
compelled to attend a segregated school may be able to

cope with ordinary expressions of prejudice by regarding the prejudiced person as evil or misguided; but he cannot readily cope with symbols of authority, the full force of the authority of the State—the school or the school board, in this instance—in the same manner. Given both the ordinary expression of prejudice and the school’s policy of segre- gation, the former takes on greater force and seemingly becomes an official expression of the latter.
Not all of the psychological traits which are com- monly observed in the social complex under discussion can be related so directly to the awareness of status differenc- es—which in turn is, as we have already noted, materially contributed to by the practices of segregation. Thus, the low level of aspiration and defeatism so commonly ob- served in segregated groups is undoubtedly related to the level of self-evaluation; but it is also, in some measure, related among other things to one’s expectations with re- gard to opportunities for achievement and, having achieved, to the opportunities for making use of these achievements. Similarly, the hypersensitivity and anxiety displayed by many minority group children about their relations with the larger society probably reflects their awareness of status differences; but it may also be influ- enced by the relative absence of opportunities for equal status contact which would provide correctives for prevail- ing unrealistic stereotypes.
The preceding view is consistent with the opinion stated by a large majority (90%) of social scientists who replied to a questionnaire concerning the probable effects of enforced segregation under conditions of equal facilities. This opinion was that, regardless of the facilities which are provided, enforced segregation is psychologically detri-
12 mental to the members of the segregated group.
Similar considerations apply to the question of what features of the social complex of which segregation is a part contribute to the development of the traits which have been observed in majority group members. Some of these are probably quite closely related to the awareness of status differences, to which, as has already been pointed out, segregation makes a material contribution. Others have a more complicated relationship to the total social setting. Thus, the acquisition of an unrealistic basis for self-evalu- ation as a consequence of majority group membership probably reflects fairly closely the awareness of status differences. On the other hand, unrealistic fears and hatreds of minority groups, as in the case of the converse phenom-

enon among minority group members, are probably signif- icantly influenced as well by the lack of opportunities for equal status contact.
With reference to the probable effects of segregation
under conditions of equal facilities on majority group mem-
bers, many of the social scientists who responded to the
poll in the survey cited above felt that the evidence is less
convincing than with regard to the probable effects of such
segregation on minority group members, and the effects are
possibly less widespread. Nonetheless, more than 80%
stated it as their opinion that the effects of such segregation
are psychologically detrimental to the majority group
13 members.
It may be noted that many of these social scientists supported their opinions on the effects of segregation on both majority and minority groups by reference to one or another or to several of the following four lines of pub-
14
lished and unpublished evidence. First, studies of chil-
dren throw light on the relative priority of the awareness of status differentials and related factors as compared to the awareness of differences in facilities. On this basis, it is possible to infer some of the consequences of segregation as distinct from the influence of inequalities of facilities. Second, clinical studies and depth interviews throw light on the genetic sources and causal sequences of various pat- terns of psychological reaction; and, again, certain infer- ences are possible with respect to the effects of segregation per se. Third, there actually are some relevant but relatively rare instances of segregation with equal or even superior facilities, as in the cases of certain Indian reservations. Fourth, since there are inequalities of facilities in racially and ethnically homogeneous groups, it is possible to infer the kinds of effects attributable to such inequalities in the absence of effects of segregation and, by a kind of subtrac- tion to estimate the effects of segregation per se in situa- tions where one finds both segregation and unequal facilities.
Segregation is at present a social reality. Questions may be raised, therefore, as to what are the likely conse- quences of desegregation.
One such question asks whether the inclusion of an intellectually inferior group may jeopardize the education of the more intelligent group by lowering educational stan- dards or damage the less intelligent group by placing it in a situation where it is at a marked competitive disadvan- tage. Behind this question is the assumption, which is examined below, that the presently segregated groups ac- tually are inferior intellectually.
The available scientific evidence indicates that much, perhaps all, of the observable differences among various racial and national groups may be adequately explained in
15
terms of environmental differences. It has been found, for
instance, that the differences between the average intelli-
gence test scores of Negro and white children decrease, and
the overlap of the distributions increases, proportionately to
the number of years that the Negro children have lived in
16
the North. Related studies have shown that this change
cannot be explained by the hypothesis of selective migra-
17
tion. It seems clear, therefore, that fears based on the
assumption of innate racial differences in intelligence are not well founded.
It may also be noted in passing that the argument regarding the intellectual inferiority of one group as com- pared to another is, as applied to schools, essentially an argument for homogeneous groupings of children by intel- ligence rather than by race. Since even those who believe that there are innate differences between Negroes and whites in America in average intelligence grant that con- siderable overlap between the two groups exists, it would follow that it may be expedient to group together the superior whites and Negroes, the average whites and Ne- groes, and so on. Actually, many educators have come to doubt the wisdom of class groupings made homogeneous solely on the basis of intelligence.18 Those who are op- posed to such homogeneous grouping believe that this type of segregation, too, appears to create generalized feelings of inferiority in the child who attends a below average class, leads to undesirable emotional consequences in the education of the gifted child, and reduces learning oppor- tunities which result from the interaction of individuals with varied gifts.
A second problem that comes up in an evaluation of the possible consequences of desegregation involves the question of whether segregation prevents or stimulates interracial tension and conflict and the corollary question of whether desegregation has one or the other effect.
The most direct evidence available on this problem comes from observations and systematic study of instances in which desegregation has occurred. Comprehensive re-
19
views of such instances clearly establish the fact that
desegregation has been carried out successfully in a variety of situations although outbreaks of violence had been com- monly predicted. Extensive desegregation has taken place without major incidents in the armed services in both Northern and Southern installations and involving officers and enlisted men from all parts of the country, including

the South.20 Similar changes have been noted in housing21
22
and industry. During the last war, many factories both in
the North and South hired Negroes on a non-segregated, non-discriminatory basis. While a few strikes occurred, refusal by management and unions to yield quelled all
23 strikes within a few days.
Relevant to this general problem is a comprehensive study of urban race riots which found that race riots oc- curred in segregated neighborhoods, whereas there was no violence in sections of the city where the two races lived, worked and attended school together.24
Under certain circumstances desegregation not only proceeds without major difficulties, but has been observed to lead to the emergence of more favorable attitudes and friendlier relations between races. Relevant studies may be
25 26
cited with respect to housing, employment, the armed
27 28 29 services and merchant marine, recreation agency, and
30 general community life.
Much depends, however, on the circumstances under which members of previously segregated groups first come in contact with others in unsegregated situations. Available evidence suggests, first, that there is less likelihood of unfriendly relations when the change is simultaneously introduced into all units of a social institution to which it is applicable— e.g., all of the schools in a school system or all
31
of the shops in a given factory. When factories introduced
Negroes in only some shops but not in others the prejudiced workers tended to classify the desegregated shops as infe- rior, “Negro work.” Such objections were not raised when complete integration was introduced.
The available evidence also suggests the importance
of consistent and firm enforcement of the new policy by
32
those in authority. It indicates also the importance of such
factors as: the absence of competition for a limited number
33
of facilities or benefits; the possibility of contacts which
permit individuals to learn about one another as individu-
34
als; and the possibility of equivalence of positions and
functions among all of the participants within the unsegre- gated situation.35 These conditions can generally be satis- fied in a number of situations, as in the armed services, public housing developments, and public schools.
The problem with which we have here attempted to deal is admittedly on the frontiers of scientific knowledge. Inevitably, there must be some differences of opinion among us concerning the conclusiveness of certain items of evidence, and concerning the particular choice of words and placement of emphasis in the preceding statement. We are nonetheless in agreement that this statement is substan- tially correct and justified by the evidence, and the differ- ences among us, if any, are of a relatively minor order and would not materially influence the preceding conclusions.

The gamemaster's central responsibility will be to ensure that the conferences run smoothly.  The gamemaster must therefore maintain a robust relationship with the program committee.  In a small class, the gamemaster may prefer to the responsibilities of the program committee for himself or herself.

* Act as secretary to the Board of Directors if there is no preceptor available.
* Remind / cajole the program committee to prepare the schedule at least 48 hours in advance of each class.
* Maintain the election cycle (see the table in the instructor's manual)
* Distribute research reports were appropriate.

### Your Biography

You were born in Brooklyn and attended the University of Michigan, while earning your medical degree from New York University in 1942. You trained in psychoanalysis at Columbia before going to Tulane University in 1951 to be Professor of psychiatry and neurology. In 1967, you were named president of the American Academy of Psychoanalysis. You are a former president of the Sexuality Information and Education Council of the United States.

You were also director of the Marriage Council of Philadelphia and counseled couples. You focused on studying conflicts between spouses and looked at the connection between testosterone levels and sexual desire in both genders.

In the early 1960s, you turned your attention to getting schools to adopt a more serious and scientific approach to teaching medical students about adult sexuality and development.

### Game Objectives

You have a long-standing friendship with both Richard Green and Diane Fordney-Settlage.

Argue against the Nomenclature's proposal to write the new DSM according to statistics and observations rather than theory and causation. In this case, you are voicing the defense of classical and Jungian psychoanalysis against the growing dominance of psychopharmacology.  Review the history of the definition of mental illness in the game book carefully, as well as the DSM-II. You are not necessarily defending the taxonomy presented in the DSM-II, but you are defending the idea that the taxonomy of psychiatric disorders should be made with an understanding of the mental mechanisms of psychoanalysis—specifically the genetic hypothesis.

If that fails, get on the task force or committee that is in charge of writing the DSM-III. Your primary interlocutor in the previous section was probably Spitzer, so you may have some work to get appointed by him. Therefore you have two options to consider: first, you can oppose the creation of the task force entirely, and then get elected to the nomenclature committee, or you can convince Spitzer to add you to his taskforce once it is created.

When, and if, the game reaches a point of trying to define mental illness, you must pass a psychoanalytic interpretation of mental disorder / illness.

### Specific Assignments

Present a paper defending the genetic hypothesis as core to taxonomy in 1974, in opposition Spitzer and his proposed 'Feighner criteria.'

            <Text> THEEAT AND CHALLENGE OF A PRESIDENTIAL ADDRESS
HERE is something about the aura of the Tterm "presidential address" which makes it a special burden and a special source of anxiety for everyone involved. Every speech, ad- dress, article, or essay exposes an important part of oneself for critical examination by an audience or by readers. For a long time, I have tried to per- suade my students that everything that a person writes—all forms of communication—may be viewed as projective materials which reveal aspects of the totality and the complexity of his personality to sensitive observers. If this is true it would follow that to communicate to psychologists, who view themselves as experts in the analysis of per- sonality and character, is to invite not only an analysis of the substance of what one communicates, but also to expose oneself to probing and critical examination. There must be an incorrigible ego drive which propels one to assume the risks of ex- posure to an audience of psychologists, given the fact that the threat of exposure is greater the more accurate are the judgments concerning the character
and wisdom of the speaker.
There remains the problem of how can one make
a presidential address in some way worth the anxie- ties and risks? One could use it as an opportunity to try to clarify the underlying conceptual frame- work implicit in his thoughts, research, writing, teaching, and social action. In one's personal and professional life, it is possible to move from project to project and from encounter to encounter, and to take on a variety of responsibilities and roles with- out having the time to give thought to the theo-

retical and philosophical perspectives which, hope- fully, unify and give some coherence to one's life and activities. It would be reassuring, especially in the latter stages of one's life, to discover that there is theoretical coherence and unity in one's professional activities and his role as a person and as a citizen.
A search for congruence and consistency among the various aspects of one's being would seem man- datory, if not inevitable, for those who are arrogant enough to use the discipline of psychology to legiti- mize their functioning. The luxury and safety of defining scientific objectivity in terms of a detached, disciplined, isolated, and amoral use of human intelligence are not available to those who have chosen to work in the social, psychological, and be- havior sciences or for that matter in the biological and medical sciences.
The research topics, findings, and analyses and insights of a psychologist cannot be divorced from the total complexity of his being. Psychological phenomena do not seem to consist of absolute reali- ties. Their reality is the tantalizing, persistent reality of the subjective. This fact of relativistic reality differentiates the science of psychology from all other sciences. This difference between psy- chology and the physical sciences remains in spite of the fact that the evidence of all sciences—in- deed, the inevitable basis of all knowledge—must be filtered through the limits of human observa- tional powers and refined by limited human intelli- gence.
Psychologists and other social scientists must seek to organize their findings within a conceptual framework which hopefully will expand knowledge and broaden and deepen insights into the nature of man and his society. There remains, also, for psy- chology, the ultimate test of the validity of all sci- ences, namely, a demonstration of an effective tech- nology—the ability to predict or control the phe- nomena which we purport to understand.

cal questions for a contemporary science of psy- chology and for other behavioral sciences are: What arc their contributions to the understanding and control of the behavior of human beings? How can the knowledge, the insights, and the re- lated technology contribute directly or indirectly to effectiveness of individual human beings, to stabil- ity in human society, and increase the chances of survival of the human species?
These are important questions, and there is now a special urgency in finding and implementing af- firmative answers to them within the context of respect for human values. What follows are the views of a person who has spent his adult life in research, teaching, writing, and social action within the discipline of social psychology as to the basis for and the direction within which humane affirma- tive answers might be found. It is also an at- tempt to share with others the process—the intel- lectual and emotional turbulence—by which these views and related suggestions concerning the dy- namics of man and society emerged.
INFLUKNCK OF EARLY RESEARCH ON DICVKLOPJNG JDKAS
My first serious scientific involvement in the larger theoretical concerns with the nature of man and society emerged as a result of the need to interpret the findings of the early research on the nature and development of the self and the problems of ego and racial identification. In these studies 1 was a collaborator with my wife, Dr. Mamie Clark. This fascinating and somewhat illusive "pure" re- search problem was initially my wife's Master's thesis problem. As she saw the larger implications of the first stages of this work, she was kind enough to invite me to join her in a more probing empirical and theoretical exploration of the nature and determinants of the self-image.
As we collected and analyzed the data obtained through the methods we used, we became im- pressed with the implications of the observation that in the initial stages of the emerging sense of self in children the substance and the dynamics of the functioning ego were determined almost ex- clusively by external pressures, determinants, and evaluative agents. These findings provided the first clues for insights concerning the fragility, vulnera- bility, dependence, indeed, the pathos of the human ego. This early research on the emergence of self-
awareness and preference in Negro children illumi- nated for us the larger pattern of problems related to ego development in human beings. Among these insights were:
• The functional substance of the self is not in- digenous to the human organism, but is determined by the nature and pattern of human interaction as this is influenced by the status of the individual in a familial and social hierarchical system. (By the way the individual is perceived and generally treated.)
• The qualitative effect of the external determi- nants of the individual's sense of self is inevitably evaluative; that is, the resulting emerging self- image inevitably brings with it a positive or nega- tive sense of the worth of self.
• This positive or negative evaluative component of self is inevitable and pivotal—and in its most primary and basic sense is not controlled by the individual himself but by others over whom he has no control.
• In the most formative and susceptible stage of a child's life, that period within which there is the beginning of the ability to cope with ideas, the idea of the self and the worth and status of the self are inextricable.
• This initial external definition of the nature, worth, and status of self tends to persist through- out the life of the individual, in that it is reinforced by consistent experiences, is internalized as the core of personality, and establishes the patterns of defense and protection which the individual uses in interpersonal and other forms of social interaction.
• In spite of the above, human beings—except those who have been totally defeated by negative evaluation of others and by consistent rejection, or those who are organically deficient—persist in the struggle for self-affirmation and the attainment of that minimum self-esteem required to continue to function as a human being. Tt remains one of the mysteries of psychological science that individual human beings differ—whether markedly or mini- mally is still open to question—in the physical equipment, intellectual strengths and general life force, and other personal resources which they can mobilize in the continuing struggle for personal affirmation and an effective self-esteem.
My research on the social and attitudinal factors influencing memory and recall—related to the larger
 problem of the effect of social factors on percep- tion and cognition—tended to reinforce my ideas concerning the fragility of the human ego. This early study, conducted in partial fulfillment for the doctorate at Columbia University incidentally, not only anticipated some of the later research on cog- nitive styles but also foreshadowed some of the concerns of the Women's Liberation movement in the finding that men and women differed markedly in the recall of the activities of a dominant woman. The finding that human beings tended to recall events in terms consistent with their attitudes and within the context of their personality seemed to
provide further supportive evidence of the human need to use all available sensory and intellective resources in the attempt to obscure the tenuousness of our being—and to assert an inner certainty and absoluteness as having reality and existence pri- marily because they are asserted.
Further studies of the effects of social pressures and the consequences of rejection and acceptance of individuals and groups by the larger society culmi- nated in the publication of Dark Ghetto. While the writing of Dark Ghetto drew on earlier research in- sights, this specific study of the psychological ef- fects of a ghetto community resulted in a more focused picture of the effects of adverse, persistent social negatives on the distortion of personality and on the impairment of psychological effectiveness of the victims of persistent rejection. Here, again, the persistent fact of the fragility and vulnerability of the human ego, somewhat tempered by insights con- cerning the counterstruggle for self-esteem and resilience of human beings, was reinforced by the
findings of this community psychology research.
It may be of some value to point out that the earlier studies of the development of self-identifica-
Ghetto research on the other hand, from its incep- tion, was clearly motivated by the desire to influ- ence social policy and influence the decisions of those with power to facilitate, block, or determine the rate of desired social change. The Dark Ghetto study cannot be described with candor as an exer- cise in "pure" research on a problem of culture and personality. This study of the dynamics of a sys- tematically dehumanizing community on the hu- manity and effectiveness of the personalities con- fined within it was not conducted without concern for the implications of these findings for social jus- tice and social change.
The Harlem Youth Opportunities (HARYOU) report, Youth in the Ghetto, expanded and revised into Dark Ghetto, was modeled after investigations in public health and preventive medicine. These reports did seek to analyze and describe the effects of social policy and practice; diagnose the nature and manifestations of social instability; and sug- gested remedies for the persistent social insensitivi- ties and resulting pathologies which robbed human beings of self-esteem, reinforced negative self-im- ages, and destroyed the chances of personal and social effectiveness.
In a recent analysis of a sample of antipoverty programs—A Relevant War Against Poverty, co- authored with Jeannette Hopkins—it was clear that the Dark Ghetto findings had influenced the ra- tionale and programmatic structure of federally funded antipoverty and community-based action programs. But, this detailed study of these pro- grams within the first two years of the programs' existence predicted their failure by revealing the controlling and inhibiting fact that those human beings with power are deeply unwilling or unable to share even a modicum of real power with those who

Above all, they reflected the inability of the

decision makers and the society as a whole to change the set of perceiving and treating the poor and dark-skin minorities as justifiably rejected in- ferior human beings. These programs did not and would not operate in terms of the rationale and the goals of the potential equality of all human beings. They did not seek to accept and strengthen the humanity of the deprived through compassion, empathy, and a serious sharing of power.
AN EMERGING CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK
There is no doubt that these research projects, the developing ideas, and the related forms of so- cial action were influenced most, fundamentally by the psychodynamic theories of Alfred Adler. The late Francis Cecil Sunnier, Professor of Psychology at Howard University, introduced me to the ideas of Adlcr. It was Professor Sumner who first intro- duced me as an undergraduate to the promises of the science of psychology for the understanding of man and society. It was he who gave me my first serious appreciation of the complexities of the meanings of humanity. In his characteristic style, Professor Sumner presented Adler's thoughts with- in the framework of other psychoanalytic and psychodynamic theories and within the larger con- text of religion and philosophy. This experience had a profound influence on my thoughts, research, and professional and personal action.
The gestalt, wholistic, and organismic theories also exerted a strong influence on my developing ideas. Kurt Goldstein's ability to interpret his ob- servations of the meaning of the symptoms of the brain-injured patients in a unified psychodynamic perspective of the struggle of human beings to maintain an integrated ego—to minimize their deficiencies and maximize their available assets— reinforced the basic significance of Adlerian and organismic theory in my thinking. As one of Gold- stein's graduate students at Columbia University, f struggled to understand his lectures. T admired his ability to present and document a wholistic, organismic view of man as a biosocial organism.
pelled me more toward the social-psychological em- phasis of Adler and made me somewhat resistant to the Freudian emphasis on deeper intrapsychic dy- namics. In its emphasis on innate instinctive processes and its related inability to emphasize the effects of social problems and continued social pres- sures on the individual's effectiveness, traditional Freudian theory seemed inadequate—limited and constricted—for a dynamic social psychology. Freudian theory does not appear to offer a theo- retical basis for a psychology concerned with so- cial change or a psychotechnology other than one- to-one psychoanalytic therapy. Adler's concern with man's social interaction and his emphasis on the human struggle for self-esteem were much more compatible with my main research and action in seeking a humane technology to enhance the chances of humanity among men. The quest for a more enlightened social policy, morally and rationally determined social change, could not proceed from the premise that man is a totally or primarily non- rational organism whose most powerful drives are instinctive and animalistic. In this regard, my re- sistance to the Freudian perspective of man and society was not unlike the objections of the late Gordon Allport who refused to accept the Freudian view of man as an essentially nonrational being. Allport insisted that the rational components of the complexities of human motivation must be given at least an equal if not a dominant role with the non- rational.
The core Adlerian idea which persists in its influence on my thinking is the idea concerning the nature of psychological power in understanding human beings and human society. Bertrand Rus- sell's assertion that "the fundamental concept in social science is Power, in the same sense in which Energy is a fundamental concept in physics" rein- forced the influence of Adlerian theory in my think- ing. In his not too well-known book, Power, Bertrand Russell stated, "The laws of social dy- namics are—so I shall contend—only capable of being studied in terms of power in its various forms." He defines power rather pragmatically as "the production of intended effects."
In earlier exploration of the phenomenon of so- cial power, T defined it operationally as "the force or energy required to bring about, to sustain or to prevent social, political or economic change." As
In spite of the more dramatic, fashionable, pro-
vocative, and, in many respects, profound ideas of
Freud, my thoughts and scientific activities were
only peripherally influenced by the fundamental
Freudian premises. My persistent concerns with
the effects of the social system on the functioning
and effectiveness of individuals and groups pro- my research and my interest in social change in-
 terests tended to converge and eventually fuse, I became preoccupied with the problem of a theory of social power as a unifying conceptual framework. More and more I tended to see social power, in its manifest forms, as that force or combination of forces which facilitated, blocked, or determined the rate and direction of social change. In a dynamic social situation, power expresses itself as a gestalt or a quantum expression of the power aspirations and competition among significant individuals and groups.
need to use the crutches of racial cruelty and ex- tremism are also forlorn, deprived, desperately pa- thetic human beings.
When one dares to confront the many examples of the mocking pathos of power, one finds oneself going beyond Adler even as he remains dependent upon fundamental Adlerian insights. The Adlerian emphasis on the affirmative struggle for self-esteem and status becomes intensified by the disturbing, almost intolerable reality that a positive self-esteem, what Freud calls narcissism, is not determined by forces inherent within the human organism, but is dependent upon external supports and reinforce- ments, and controlled by the judgments of others who themselves are also afflicted with the universal human anxiety of self-doubt.

the capacity to love and be loved and thereby the universe. They make possible perception,
strengthens the cycle of self-defeating obsession with power.
A contemporary example of human power pathos is found in the anguished cries of the advocates of black power. In this phenomenon it is clear that the verbalizations of power betray the reality of powerlessness. The frustrations, the rejection, the denial of the ability to fulfill legitimate aspirations are compensated for among extreme advocates of black power by the posture and the delusional rhet-
oric of a power which is persistently denied them. This insight into the nature of this particular form of diversionary pseudo-power paradoxically led me into a more empathic understanding of the human pathos and psychological predicament of white racial extremists. Through my understanding and racial identification with compensatory black ex- tremists, I came to understand that whites who
awareness, evaluation, self-reflection, anxiety, re- flection on the past, and anticipation of the future. They are unique in that they make the human ego real—sometimes painfully real. They create and validate humanity, and they sustain the struggle for justice and decency in human relationship even as they provide the basis for rationalizing cruelties and inhumanity.
To make these abstractions real, these mysterious human cortical cells require a rather specific bio- chemical environment. They require that oxygen and nourishment be provided and regulated through an elaborate capillary system. The unstable equi- librium within and around these cells must be main- tained within a tolerable range of variation if the human ego and the complexities of function and continuity inherent in the sense of self are to be sustained.
The essence of the human predicament is the
man consciousness is the mysterious substances and the quality of interactions among the human corti- cal cells. All we seem to know about these cells is that they are unique among all of the combinations of matter and energy which are known to exist in
 1052 AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGIST
The normal functioning and the identity of the self can be disrupted through one or any combina- tion of disturbances within the internal environ- ment. Disruption in continuity of a personal iden- tity--loss of social and psychological continuity and existence—can occur in spite of the continuation of biological existence if there is any significant depri- vation in the specific biochemical requirements of these cortical cells. With such deprivation there can be changes in temperament and fundamental changes in the threshold of positive and negative responses or sensitivity to external environmental
forces.
Jn shorl, these cortical cells hold within them
the keys to the mystery of the definition and the functional quality of the self. They control by their ability to intensify, reduce, or obliterate the basic reality that is the self. And they are fragile. And it is upon the basis of their fragility that the human ego remains a fragile and delicate thing. To be human is not determined merely by the con- cretes of sensory functions, neural integration, and skeletal muscular behavior of the human organism. The essence of being human is defined by the nor- mal functioning of the uniquely complex human brain.
These insights are fraught with anxieties and probably should best be handled by denial or re- pression. Even before the ennui of youth became a fashionable topic of discussion, one of my students once suggested in a brilliant paper for my class in human motivation that the fundamental fear of man was the fear of confronting the void within. The sense of inner emptiness, a sense of limited experiential time, a sense of essential powerlessness, as the basic realities of the human experience—
these arc not tolerable insights. They must be compensated for with more positive, substantive concepts of self. Fortunately, the human brain that made this human predicament possible can also create, invent, or rationalize idcational substance up to and including indefinite continuity for the human ego.
The idea of the void within is abhorrent. The void must be filled. The creative activities of man —his religion, his philosophy, his art, hisliterature, his buildings, his cults, his cruelties, his science, his
objectifications of the inner turbulence of man. In proving to himself that his life is more than the continuous transformation of one form of biological and chemical energy into other forms of physical and behavioral energy, man seems compelled to mobilize and use psychological and social power constructively or destructively. The alternative would be to accept a level of desperation and stag- nation, indistinguishable from psychological death.
Among the paradoxes of the human predicament is that these disturbing insights, complicated as they are by the inevitability of evaluation inherent in the operation of human consciousness, demand that the human beings define human existence in terms greater than an interval between the acci- dents of conception and birth and the infinite noth- ingness of death. The mysterious power and forces which culminate in human consciousness insist that to be human is to be more than the awe- some and finite mystery of existential life. Human beings must affirm humanity and assert that there is purpose to and sacredness to human life despite
all threatening evidence to the contrary. This is the dynamic and the compensatory pathos of power. Affirmation in spite of—is the common denominator of human creativity and destructiveness; of human love and kindness and human hostility and cruelty; of human compassion and human egocentric postur- ing and bombast. It provides the basis for all that is sacred and barbaric in man.
In his discussion of the psychic fictions which arc essential in providing substance to human psy- chological existence, Adler stated in his Under- standing Human Nature:
We can realize how relative are the values of sensations, when not even these are absolute quantities; these elements of our psychic activity are influenced by the striving for a definite goal, our very perceptions are prejudiced by it, and are chosen, so to speak, with a secret hint at the final goal toward which the personality is striving.
We orient ourselves according to a fixed point which we have artificially created, which does not in reality exist, a fiction. This assumption is necessary because of the inade- quacy of our psychic life. . . . Tn the case of all psychic fictions we have to do with the following: we assume a fixed point even though closer observation forces us to ad- mit that it does not exist. The purpose of this assumption is simply to orient ourselves in the chaos of existence, so
that we can arrive at some apperception of relative values. The advantage is that we can categorize every sensation and every sentiment according to this fixed point, once we
technologies--are attemps to fill this void or to
obscure its existence. Human civilizations are have assumed it.
 These psychic fictions, these ideational inventions and objective creations of man which constitute his culture and civilizations, ordinarily seem sufficient to quell temporarily the incipient anguish of the imminence of nonbeing. They frequently postpone the ultimate embarrassment of the acceptance of personal and collective nonimportance.
Of all the compensatory protective agents in- vented or created by the human brain as a cushion against the intolerable realities of human flimsiness, probably the most flexible and effective has been the idea of God. Man has invested God with both omnipotence and permanence. An analysis of the characteristics of God, the powers and functions of God, betrays the pathos and the vulnerability of man. One of the most important functions of God is that of protecting man against accepting and coming to terms with the realities of human limi- tations. In a most literal and basic psychological sense, God is the primary source of power for man. Man created God to create man with introjective strengths, with solidity, and with purpose and sub- stance. To perform this awesome and important task there must be an ideationally literal God. If for no other reason, therefore, God is not only not dead, man cannot permit God to die. If God were to die, human beings would have to die psychologi- cally, even though alive as organisms.
The importance of God as a protection against the fragility of the human ego is revealed in the demigods, the directly observable gods, created by the human mind and also invested with protective power. Magicians, medicine men, priests, bishops, kings, generals, father figures, movie stars, all serve similar if not identical divine functions. These charismatic figures, these personifications of power, are anointed and given virtues and powers beyond those found in ordinary men. Through identifica- tion with them and their projected power, the average man can obscure his weaknesses and affirm his ego. These human gods sometimes internalize the god-like powers attributed to them. They soon believe and act as if they are gods—or are required to engage in a continuous struggle against this tantalizing temptation. From this point of view, paradox emerges as the major characteristic or quality of a bemused God—a God of the inescap- able practical joke of the human predicament.
A similar protective and power brokerage func- tion is played by the variety of groups that human
beings have invented and emotionally identified with. Tribes, cults, religions, nations, and their coercive and protective dogmas and ideologies may be seen as group gods, which bestow substance and strengths upon otherwise vulnerable individuals. The strength and power of a group seem directly proportional to the degree to which it can compen- sate for the fragility or obscure the insignificance and pathos of its individual members. These group benefits appear to be enhanced by the group's dem-
onstrated ability to exercise power over and inflict cruelty upon other groups of human beings.
SOCIAL POWER: A STRUGGLE FOR INTEGRATION FOR ORGANISMIC AND SOCIAL SYSTEMS
There is the tendency among many of us who are concerned with studying more systematically the crucial role of social power in human affairs to present our case as if power is the only significant motivational force and as if it can operate in isola- tion from the total complexity of structure and integrated functions of organismic and social sys- tems.
A realistic view of social power requires that it be seen as a pervasive and integrative force, oper- ating in relationship to other forces in the dynamic constellation of the human personality.
Personality is defined here as the characteristic way in which the individual human organism mo- bilizes and uses all of its available resources in its struggle for survival, satisfaction, status, meaning, and moral integrity.
This definition suggests a hierarchy of the moti- vational components of personality: in this hier- archy, power or status needs fall midway between the more primitive drives toward survival and sensual satisfactions and the uniquely human mo- tives of the quest for meaning and moral integrity. Power may, therefore, operate toward either end of the motivational continuum to reinforce or make dominant either the primitive or the human pro- pensities of man. Power may make stark and rigid, or determine fixation on or regression to, one or another of the other motivational levels; and it may determine the pattern of relationship among the motivational levels. It can also intensify, ob- scure, or contaminate one or more of them as they function in the dynamic system of interaction which is the totality of the personality. Power

and status needs can determine whether other needs will be gratified in animalistic, egocentric, or non- adaptive ways or in human, empathic, and socially constructive channels.
This is the dilemma of power from whence the pathos of power arises.
CONTEMPORARY CRISES OF THE PATHOS OF POWER
Power cannot be exercised without inducing some form of reaction or counterreaction. Social power in its manifest forms, therefore, almost always in- volves confrontations and conflicts; and generally results in either accommodation, with or without residual resentment; or in acute defiance, sporadic counterreaction, or prolonged and smoldering re- sistance. This is the psychodynamic base for the cycle of power: reaction to power and counter- reaction.
The rewards of the exercise of power are transi- tory, and the gratifications of power and status needs are frequently nonadaptive and self-defeating. The following arc some specific symptoms of the nonadaptive pathos, futility, of power.
1. When the exercise of power does not, in fact, increase or when it interferes with the chances of gratifying the more basic needs of survival and satisfaction.
2. When the exercise of power is ambiguous, ran- dom, arbitrary, regressive, disproportionately in- tense and rigid in spite of consequences.
3. When the exercise of power becomes so func- tionally autonomous and extreme in its intensity as to subvert and pervert the critical, rational, and moral capacities of individuals and groups.
4. When the attainment of the symbols of power or the unchallenged actuality of power results in a sense of futility and ennui and the dissipation of the desire or the capacity to use power construc- tively or creatively.
The continuation, intensification, and cumulative effect of any combination of these symptoms are major threats to the organism or the social system. This crisis betrays the fact that the power system has become self-directing and is no longer being controlled by the organism and social system in terms of their adaptive needs. The survival of the system would then seem to depend on its capacity to redirect the power drives and channel their energy toward constructive ends within the im- perative period of time.
Certainly, the normal brain has the necessary survival alert systems which ordinarily can be put into operation to prevent the organism from pur- suing rigidly the paths of self-destruction. Whether the brain of man can provide the basis for resolv- ing the contemporary survival crises of social power positively and constructively remains a mat- ter of conjecture. It is a mocking fact that the human brain can provide intellectual and moral rationalizations for a nonadaptive, ultimately de- structive use of social power. It can invent ideational, delusional realities that provide the crutches for the fragile human ego. It can justify human pomp and pretense as a myriad of non- rational forces propels man toward disaster. But the human brain is also the only source of positive alternatives—alternatives to personal anxieties, hu- miliations, intergroup tensions, violence—alterna- tives to suicide, homicide, and the barbarities of war.
Contemporary man's technological mastery of matter and energy, and the related ultimate thermo- nuclear weaponry, confronts us with the fact that it is now possible to destroy the human species through the nonadaptive use of human intelligence and the destructive, pathetic use of social power. This threat is so ultimate and so urgent that it is understandable that human beings would seek to deny or repress it in order to continue to function as if it did not exist. But it does exist. And it must be handled if human beings are to be able to function without the gnawing and debilitating anxieties inherent in the imminence of extinction.
This survival crisis requires immediate mobiliza- tion of all that is positive within man to provide us with the time necessary to prevent man from destroying the human species—and to provide man with the time required to evolve and to develop a more stable organismic base for the rational and moral exercise of social power.
ERA OF PSYCHOTECHNOLOGY
The present generation of human beings is re- quired to develop psychological and social sciences with that degree of precision, predictability, and moral control essential to the survival of man. The awesome advances in the physical and biologi- cal sciences have made psychotechnology impera- tive. Man can no longer afford the luxuries of a leisurely, trial-and-error, trivia-dominated approach
 THE PATHOS OF POWEE 1055
to the behavioral sciences. The behavioral sciences results but that they require continuous reinforce-
are now the critical sciences; they will determine the answer to the ultimate moral question of human survival.
Given the urgency of this immediate survival problem, the psychological and social sciences must enable us to control the animalistic, barbaric, and primitive propensities in man and subordinate these negatives to the uniquely human moral and ethical characteristics of love, kindness, and empathy.
The redirecting of power away from the absurd, the pathetic, and the self-defeating can be and now must be seen as a responsibility and goal of science and psychotechnology. We can no longer afford to rely solely on the traditional, prescientific attempts to contain human cruelty and destructiveness. The techniques and appeals of religion, moral philos- ophy, law, and education seemed appropriate and civilized approaches to the control of man's prim- itive and egocentric behavior in a prenuclear age. They are, in themselves, no longer appropriate because they permit too wide a margin of error and a degree of unpredictability that is rationally in- consistent with the present survival urgency. Fur-
thermore, moral verbalizations of the past have been prostituted by the pathos of power; they have been perverted by the pretenses of rationality in the service of inhumanity if not barbarity.
The traditional perspective and training of psy- chologists, educators, and moral philosophers would lead them to continue to argue that moral controls of human primitive and egocentric impulses be sought by redoubling our efforts in developing more effective forms of moral education designed to pro- duce individual human beings with ethical autonomy and integrity. They would argue that it is still possible to preserve human civilization by training human beings toward a higher quality of inter- personal relationships; by developing within indi- vidual human beings greater personal and social effectiveness through greater ego strengths. They would continue to assert that a variety of be- havioral modification techniques, imposed particu- larly in childhood, could be expected to reinforce altruism, empathy, and group commitment and sub- ordinate egocentricity in normal human beings.
An objective appraisal of the results of these approaches to a control of the negatives in man and the enhancement of his positives would seem to suggest that not only are they unpredictable in
ment and a prolonged period of time in order to demonstrate positive results. We do not now appear to have the amount of time which these techniques require for hoped-for success.
This present era of psychotechnology comes with the abrupt recognition of this fact of a very limited time within which the human brain can obtain and use that knowledge required to control, protest, and affirm humanity with precision and predictability. Already there are many provocative and suggestive findings from neurophysiological, biochemical, and psychopharmacological and psychological research. The work on the effects of direct stimulation of certain areas of the brain; the role of specific areas of the midbrain in controlling certain affects; the effects of certain drugs on exciting, tranquilizing, or depressing the emotional and motivational levels of the individual; and the effects of externally in- duced behavioral changes on internal biochemistry of the organism suggest that we might be on the threshold of that type of scientific biochemical in- tervention which could stabilize and make dominant the moral and ethical propensities of man and subordinate, if not eliminate, his negative and primitive behavioral tendencies.
On the basis of the presently available evidence, it is reasonable to believe that this type of precise, direct psychotechnological intervention geared to- ward strengthening man's moral and positive human characteristics could be obtained and implemented within a few years, and with a fraction of the cost required to produce the atom bomb; and much less than the present cost of our explorations in outer space.
It is here being suggested that with the mobiliza- tion of the necessary scientific personnel, financial resources, and research facilities, it is now possible —indeed, imperative—to reduce human anxieties, tensions, hostilities, violence, cruelty, and the de- structive power irrationalities of man which are the basis of wars. This contemporary approach to assuring the survival of the human species offers a scientific basis for William James' philosophical wish for a moral equivalence or alternative to wars.
In reducing the negatives and enhancing the posi- tive potentials in human beings, in addition to the political organizational and administrative problems to be resolved, there would be a number of im- portant psychological barriers to be faced and
 1056 AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGIST
solved with realism and clue regard lor that essen- tial humanity which differentiates human beings from mere organisms or living machines. The process and techniques of direct biochemical inter- vention or any form of effective psychotechnology must take into account the totality, the inter- relatedncss, the complex gestalt of the human moti- vational, affective, and cognitive system. Jn seek- ing to enhance the positives of empathy and kind- ness and reduce the cruel and the barbaric in man, psychotechnology must not destroy the creative, evaluative, and selective capacities of human beings. Without the desire to explore, to reorganize things and ideas, to vary moods, and to produce, at least with the illusions of flexibility and volition, the human being would indeed be an empty organic vessel and it would be difficult to justify the mere fact of survival under these conditions. In addition to precision and predictability, this suggested psy- chotechnological intervention into human affairs must be affirmatively humane. An inviolable sense of moral responsibility is the essential new in- gredient which this new era of the psychological sciences must bring to the contemporary require- ments of science.
The implications of a precise and predictable psychotechnological intervention into the whole arena of human interaction are of such vast im- portance as to demand that the most careful and rigorous planning, research, and testing precede any attempts to apply these findings on a larger scale. Because these are uniquely human problems with which this program is concerned, the pretest sub- jects would have to be human beings. The impli- cations of an effective psychotechnology for the con- trol of criminal behavior and the amelioration of the moral insensitivities which produce reactive criminality in others arc clear. It would seem, therefore, that there would be moral and rational justification for the use of compulsive criminals as pretest subjects in seeking precise forms of inter- vention and moral control of human behavior. This suggestion is based on the assumption that no human being who is not impelled by some forms of internal, biochemical or external, social forces—or some combination of both—would choose to be a
criminal if he were provided with options.
It is a fact that a few men in the leadership positions in the industrialized nations of the world now have the power to determine among them-
selves, through collaboration or competition, the survival or extinction of human civilization. They can, in fact, exercise this power only within the present limitations of the pathos and contradictions of power for temporary good or unpredictable ulti- mate evil. There is no way of predicting the personal and emotional stability of these leaders with the life and death power over mankind. Nor do we now know the relationship between those personal characteristics which are related to suc- cess in obtaining positions of political and govern- mental power on the one hand and the degree of personal, emotional, and moral stability on the other hand. The masses of human beings are now required to live and continue to work on faith, hope, denial, and the acceptance of the chances that their powerful leaders will have the strength to use their power wisely and morally.
Given these contemporary facts, it would seem logical that a requirement imposed on all power- controlling leaders—and those who aspire to such leadership—would be that they accept and use the earliest perfected form of psychotechnological, bio- chemical intervention which would assure their positive use of power and reduce or block the possibility of their using power destructively. This form of psychotechnological medication would be a type of internally imposed disarmament. It would assure that there would be no absurd or barbaric use of power. It would provide the masses of human beings with the security that their leaders would not or could not sacrifice them on the altars of their personal ego pathos, vulnerability—and in- stability.
It is possible to object to the era of psycho- technology on "moral" grounds and to assert that these suggestions are repugnant because they are manipulative and will take away from man his natural right to make errors—even those errors which perpetrate cruelties and destruction upon other human beings. In the light of the realities of and possible consequences of nuclear weaponry, these allegedly moral arguments seem mockingly, pathetically immoral. It would seem that man could afford to indulge in this type of abstract, pre- scientific moralizing in the past when his most destructive weapons were clubs, bow and arrows, or even gunpowder. To continue this type of thinking in an age when nuclear weapons are capable of destroying millions of human beings in a single
 irrational man-made event would seem to be a form of self-defeating and immoral rigidity.
There could be the further objection that bio- chemical intervention into the inner psychological recesses of motivation, temperament, and behavior of human beings is an unacceptable, intolerable tampering with the natural or God-given character- istics of man. The negative connotations presently associated with discussions of drugs and the drug culture, particularly among young people, could be invoked to support this objection. One could also object on the ground that, in effect, what is here being suggested under the guise of an imperative psychotechnology is just another form of Utopian mechanization of human beings through drugging the masses and their leaders.
These objections seem to be based on semantic grounds rather than on essential substance. In medicine, physical diseases are controlled through medication. Medicines are prescribed by doctors to help the body overcome the detrimental effects of bacteria or viruses—or to help the organism restore that balance of internal biochemical environment necessary for health and effectiveness. Medicines are not only used to treat the diseases of individ-
uals, but arc also used preventively in the form of vaccines. All medicines are drugs—and all drugs used therapeutically are forms of intervention to influence and control the natural processes of dis- ease. Selective and appropriate medication to as- sure psychological health and moral integrity is now imperative for the survival of human society.
The era of psychotechnology, having been im- posed upon man by the physical scientific advances of man, cannot now be avoided. It must be used affirmatively, wisely, and with com- passion. To fulfill these requirements, it must have a sound scientific, factual base. It must also be firmly rooted in rational morality. It must respect and enhance that which is uniquely human in man—those positive qualities which promise a fu- ture of human grandeur. In meeting these and related requirements, a rigorous, tough-minded sci- ence and technology of psychology will save man from the more destructive consequences of his absurdities and propensities—the pathos of power— and will provide him with the time necessary to evolve and stabilize those centers of his brain which will make social morality and human survival no longer a matter of chance.

Corucrpt
Many notable teachers of psychology, textbook authors, and practicing psychologists (Beniamin &amp; Lowman, 1981, McKeachie,I9TSi Radford 8L Rose, I980| have im- plored professors to give undergraduate students the experience of actually working at the tasks that psychologists perform. In many undergraduate lecture courses, students become oriented to what clinicians do and may even observe audiotaped or videotaped examples of clinical activities. Yet, because of ethical concerns (e.g., confidentiality problems, using untrained students to make interventions or impor- tant decisions regarding a client) or the sheer numbers of students involved, psychol- ogy students are rarely directed to-attempt the hands-on exercise of clinical skills. When students are tested in abnormal psychology courses, they are often expected to make diagnostic decisions, provide a prognosis, and define the relevance of particu- lar forms of therapy for different disorders-all based on fragments of hypothetical cases, often presented in the form of multiple-choice items. This article describes a method that involves students in the relevant simulation of a variety of clinical experiences. We have employed these techniques or "miniclinics" in several courses that contain units related to clinical assessment and intervention (e.g. abnormal,
child development, and introductory psychology courses).
Besides the three student worksheets that are replicated here, the most important element of the miniclinic exercise is the case material presented by the instructor- ideally, written background information and films or videotapes. Satisfactory but less revealing and stimulating for discussion are written case histories.
Recently, there has been an increase in both the quality and the selection of clinical vignettes {both actual and simulated productions). These are often available from book publishers for a small fee or at no charge to instructors who have adopted the publisher's text book in abnormal psychology.
The film catalogues of colleges and universities are another excellent source of such material. The film "Otto-A Case Study in Abnormal Behavior" (Film No. ECl404, l6; available from the Audio-Visual Center, Indiana University, Bloom- ington, IN 47405-5901) features a case enactment designed to be studied from the

basic models of psychopathology and treatment. This fine fiim mav he ^.r^_ separately or in a series o? fil*, dlsphying various representat;;;;r;:Jil:[: the hypothetical Otro from their own model of therapy.
The paper-and-pencil materials include three worksheers: (a) Intake and prob- lem Formulation, (bl DSM-III classification, and (c) Treatment plan and Prognosis. These forms should be reproduced for each student.
Undergraduate students are assigned at random to one of several ,,clinic,, groups representing a model or school of psychopathology (e.g., psychoanalytic, behalvioral, client-centered, existential, biological). we harr" iorrrJ thargroups of 6-t0 sruden$ function effectively for these- exercises. During the course of the semester, as
are convened, students are rot'ated to other models. This procedure ensures "tini., that each
student is exposed to the full complement of therapeutic approaches and helps each student develop ease of communication with other members of the class.
The clinic simulation procedure is generally introduced approximately 4 or 5 weeks into the semester. This timing permits the instructor to cover, in standard sequence/ introductory chapters on abnormal psychology, the various models or approaches to psychopathology, the chapters on classification and assessment pro- cedures, and at least one content chapter focusing on the disorders themselves. There chapters are usually followed by material covering the remaining cliagnostic catego- ries- The experienced instructor will frequently find that most textbooks follow tLis fairly standard sequence.
Critical to the success of the exercise is the effective introduction of the material in chapters about models of psychopathology and the Diagnostic and. Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Third Edition (DSM-III;American psychiatric Associa- tion, 1980)' When these chapters are taught (and they should be introduced early in the coursef , it is important to prepare the students for the eventual clinic exercise by demonstrating how a case can be viewed by the various models, regardless of the diagnosis agreed upon from the DSM-III. For example, depression can be viewed as
resulting from a chemical imbalance, from a reduction in reinforcement, or from a symbolic loss accentuated by a fixation in the oral stage of development. Thus, before students are actually given the clinic assignment, it is imporianr that they have understood to some degree the ideas behind the various models, the nature of the classification system, and at least one area of disorders outlined in the DSM-\il,
Tirne requirements for the exercise vary with the depth of each instructor's involvement with the procedure. For example, some instructors may not wish to have the clinic groups complete each form for each case presented. However, aker the stimulus case has been presented, at least 30 minutes of discussion and process' ing should be made available for the groups. Additional time for a general review of each group's findings, a discussion of agreement within and among groups, and a
presentation of new material by the instructor is needed. fo, thoroug=h-processing of the exercise, a full hour should be allotted. Group discussion ,.rd ti" irocessing of information can be carried over from one class session to the next. However,wehave found the process to be smoother when the entire exercise is completed within one class session. Problems of absenteeism/ retention of the case matJrial, and so forth are minimized when closure is achieved within one crass period.
Students in each of the miniclinics are presented with an overview of the natlJt,e of the learning task. prior to the acrual presentation of case -r;;;i;;;.rJ.nrc ineach clinic are reminded of the particular concerns and variables relevant to their discr

pline. The psychoanalytical group is, for example, cued to look for important fea- tures of early childhood, for current defense mechanisms employed, and for the possible forms that an eventual transference might take. Simiiar coaching is directed toward members of other miniclinics. These instructions are provided to students in a general session so students can become further aware of the di.fferentiation in task and approach of the various therapeutic schools.
When clinic assignments and the general review have been completed, the full case presentation is made, starting with background information provided by the instructor. Each group also receives a copy of the written case history. it is helpful to select cases with a good deal of background information so that students from each clinic have enough potential information to make a case for the relevance or efficacy of their mode. After the background information is presented, the recording of the case is played. Next, students divide into clinic groups to discuss the case and to complete the paper-and-pencil assignments. While the students are working in their groups, it is helpful for the instructor to interact with each group in progress.
The paper-and-pencil assignments consist of three worksheets: Intake and Problem Formulation, DSM-III Classification, and Treatment Plan and Prognosis. Students are instructed to tailor their observations to their assigned perspective on the Intake and Problem Formulation Worksheet. For example, under the Historical Antecedent section, behaviorists are encouraged to note possible early learning his- tories, psychoanalysts are told to report possible developmental trauma, and stu- dents in the physiological clinic are directed to focus on possible early signs of neurological disorder, brain iniury, congenital problem, and so forth. Each student is required to complete this form, although group discussion may take place before each student has completed the assignment.
The DSM-III worksheet requires students in each of the clinics to review all five axes of the DSM-/IL Of course, students are informed that they will rarely utilize all axes in classifuing a case. As with the intake and Problem Formulation Worksheet, each student is required to complete a form after group discussion. Students are encouraged to stick to their guns even if others in the clinic disagree. Because of this practice, reliability estimates may be made for each clinic,
The classification exercise is followed by the completion of the Treatment Plan and Prognosis Worksheet. It is here that students are able to exercise the most creativity and to display familiarity with their assigned model of practice. Interven- tions should be justified on the basis of problem documentation and relevance to the student's particular mode. The prognosis section is also to be completed with refer- ence to the assigned model and with consideration of the available resources and circumstances relevant to the model (e.g., How well would an older adult with an IQ of 7S do in traditional psychoanalysis?).
With the worksheets completed, the full class reassembles to process the results of the exercise. The instructor leads d discussion of each worksheet activity, high- lighting the points of view for each model represented. In addition, a discussion of agreement or disagreement on diagnosis, etiology, and treatment both within and among groups may be held. Rough estimates of percent agreement within groups may be calculated by simply dividing the number of agreements (with the correct diagnostic category) by the combined number of agreements and disagreements within each group. It should be made clear to students, however, that this number is only a rough estimate that is probably inflated because it does not account for the number of agreements that would be expected by chance. It is probably not worth the

time it would take to labor through a complete explanation of the probabilities of chance agreement for each diagnostic category.
The miniclinic method presents several advantages to the instructor as well as a few potential stumbling block6. Advantages include teaching students the rigors of keeping within theoretical models, teaching the logical connection between an etio- logical conception of problems and interventions associated with particular models, and exploring the problem of how models relate (or do not relate| to the current classification system. Finally, students are able to learn clinical material *ittrout rote. They learn that the DSM-II/ is a real tool and enjoy exercising their diagnostic skill through safe risk taking in the miniclinic.
The problems associated with this process include the always-present possibility that passive students will remain passive and let others complete the exercise. The medical students/ disease syndrome and the phenomena of the "instant expert/, can also be stimulated by this activity, yet early warnings and effective feedback in class can do much to prevent these problems.
One final and nontechnical note summarizing the process is in order: Both students and instructors who use this process find it a lot of fun!

            <Title>Clark-1958-AQuestionOfValues</Title>
            <Text> A Question of Values
Having read K. E. Clark's America's Psychologists and the recent statement by Division 12 of the new requirement for fellowship status of "a significant con- tribution," we were impressed with the fact that either intentionally or unintentionally values are playing an increasingly significant role in determining the criteria which will be selected as appropriate for assessing the status of professional psychologists.
It is interesting to note in this connection that in Clark's book much emphasis is given to research publi- cation as a means of differentiating "significant con- tributors" from their ostensibly less productive col- leagues. It is apparent that discrimination on this basis has the advantages of objectivity and ease of determi- nation. There are certainly other equally important criteria, however difficult to measure, which the clinical psychologist might suggest: such as skill in diagnosis and therapy, number of patients benefited through treat- ment, direct and indirect contributions to the solution of mental hygiene problems in the community. The teacher of psychology would, we think, have still other pertinent criteria which he might consider of major import: such as the number of students toward whose education he has substantially contributed, the number of students he has motivated to pursue further study in psychology, and contributions to mental health through informal counseling.
The point we are trying to make is that a value system to a large extent determines what functions or productions are to be considered worthy and thus tends to sustain them. It should be remembered that Clark's book addresses itself, not only to research psychologists, but to the entire profession as well as to any other in- terested intelligent reader. Surely some consideration could have been given to other professional endeavors which are of significance to a large number of psychol- ogists. It is recognized that Clark and his co-workers cannot be criticized for delimiting their area of inves- tigation; but, if the book is intended to present infor- mation about all of America's psychologists, then errors of omission can loom as large as errors of commission. Clark himself reports that about three times as many psychologists are members of Division 12 than any other division. Might not some valuable hypotheses, amenable to research investigation, have been forthcom- ing from this large group as well as from the smaller number of psychology teachers? And what about prob- lems that appear significant for which no appropriate methodology currently exists? These oversights or neglect trouble us. We see it as a sign of things to
**
come; perhaps, the structure of the APA may be seri- ously threatened.
Even Division 12 seems to be suffering from this same (unrecognized?) conflict. New fellows will have to have made an "outstanding contribution" to psychology. Will these contributions be limited to those which can be reliably and validly investigated, leaving the impor- tant service and teaching functions to be relegated to secondary importance because of the difficulty in estab- lishing valid criteria for their assessment? Or is it to be a long list of (significant?) publications that will be the summum bonum? Was it W. S. Maugham in his Summing Up who said that writing a book was inher- ently no more valuable an activity than plowing a field? The value lies in the eyes of the doer (and perhaps in the contribution to others).
We might add that this question of values pervades many diverse areas in psychology, including psycho- metric assessment and teaching. In "Comments on Meehl and Rosen's Paper" (Psychol. Bull., 19S6, 53, 335-337) by S. Karson and S. B. Sells, essentially the same problem was raised. Certain remarks by S. L. Pressey in "Teaching in the Ivory Tower, with Rarely a Step Outside" (Psychol. Bull, 1955, 52, 343-344) are especially relevant. Although his plea is for a wider range of experiment in teaching evaluation studies, his words (p. 344) are noteworthy:
Climb higher in the ivory tower! Why not instead come down and open the door, watch what students do outside class, see what psychologists are doing in the wide world, and even venture off campus occasionally, to mix with the folks on Main Street.

A Reply
The comments of Karson, Baler, and Carroll suggest that the planning of the program of research reported in America's Psychologists intentionally or unintention- ally was influenced by value judgments. What they mean to say, obviously, is that they believe the wrong values were assigned, especially in the study of factors influencing an individual psychologist's research contri- butions to psychology. I gather that Karson, Baler, and Carroll would rather have had us study the contri- bution of individual psychologists to the solution of individual and society problems. I would like to see somebody make such a study; I do no.t believe Amer- ica's Psychologists should be criticized for having done

a different type of study than this, nor should it be concluded that we avoided use of clinical criteria simply because they were too difficult to assess.
The emphasis given to research publication, to which Karson, Baler, and Carroll object, occurred in our study of the way in which significant contributors dif- fered from their less productive colleagues. Attention to publication was essential, we felt, since any contri- bution to science necessarily involves comunication with one's fellows about results. The service a therapist gives to his client may be a great contribution to the
America's Psychologists did give consideration to other professional endeavors. One chapter deals with the comparative characteristics of clinical psychologists and of psychologists in other areas of specialization. Another includes a survey of private practice in clin- ical psychology in Los Angeles. Both of these studies involve no evaluation of the individual clinician, but still provide useful insights into the nature of contribu- tions being made by these persons.
Of course, we were dealing with values in making decisions about the way to proceed in the study of client, but it is not communicated to other psychol- American psychology. Our responsibility was to rec-
ogists. Likewise, the therapist may gain great skill in ognize what values we held and to make them explicit
his work and become an exceedingly capable person; but, unless he has some method, either in the training of others or through his writing, to convey what he has learned to his colleagues, he has not made a contribu- tion to psychology. Our study included in the signifi- cant contributor group a substantial number of clinical psychologists. These persons might have been nom- inated either because of their writing or because of the substantial training programs they directed for clinical psychologists, but not solely because they were excel- lent therapists. Note our directions to raters:
One of the studies being conducted under Project B is an investigation of factors influencing the productivity of research psychologists. Part of this study involves the de- velopment of a small sample of persons considered by their colleagues to have made significant research contributions in psychology, either through their own original work, or through their part in training research workers, this sample to be drawn from a larger roster of persons who have be- come "visible" to their colleagues through substantial con- tributions to the research literature. . . .
You are asked to nominate those persons whom you con- sider to have made the most significant contributions to psychology as a science, cither through scientific work of their own, or through their work in the training of research psychologists.
in our account. What these values were is revealed to any careful reader through the detailed procedures em- ployed in our study. In this respect, our study is no different from any other experimental investigation. While we were not willing to stop with a study that directed its attention only toward the characteristics of research psychologists, we did feel that they deserved primary attention, since the field of psychology can grow and develop only with a continuing increment to knowledge. Many clinical psychologists do not make contributions to science as science is normally defined; that they do make contributions is recognized by all.
I think we need to recognize that all of American psychology is today perplexed about the relative values to assign to research and to service in our growing field. Karson, Baler, and Carroll protest that decisions are being made about the desired characteristics of a clin- ical psychologist on traditional bases without enough attention being given to changing conditions and new roles played by clinical psychologists. For this posi- tion I think they can find full and unqualified support in America's Psychologists.

##### Charles W. Socarides, MD Professor of Psychiatry, Columbia University and/or Irving Bieber, MD Professor of Psychiatry, NYU Medical College (Freudian)

Irving Bieber is Professor of Psychiatry at New York University Medical College and Charles Socarides at Columbia University.  Socarides and Bieber have spent most of their career treating and studying male homosexuality. Bieber is primary author of the 1962 study Homosexuality: A Psychoanalytic Study of Male Homosexuals is, in many ways, a response to the Kinsey Report. It reports on you study of 106 male homosexuals and 100 male heterosexuals seeking psychoanalysis for various problems.  According to Socarides and Bieber,  homosexuality is a neurotic adaptation to unresolved conflict, usually originating in the Oedipal stage of development.

##### John P. Spiegel, MD  Director, Lemberg Center for the Study of Violence, Brandeis University

World-famous for his study of combat fatigue, co-authored with Dr. Roy Grinker in the 1945 book Men Under Stress.  Grinker and Spiegel argued, quite persuasively, that combat fatigue was not a result of a character flaw, but rather the social circumstances of war. It should, therefore, be treated, not punished. Spiegel is a former president of the American Academy of Psychoanalysis.

Initial member of the nomenclature committee, term expiring 1974.

#### Behaviorists

##### Albert Bandura, PhD  Professor of Psychology, Stanford
Initially serving the APA as Vice president (or President-elect) of the APA in 1971, will become president in 1972. He is therefore an initial member of the board of directors.

Bandura was trained in Behaviorism while at the University of Iowa, where Hull's advocate Spense taught. He was not, however, attracted to the strict mathematical-deductive model proposed by Hull, tending towards the work of Tolman.  After graduating Iowa, he went west to work with other like-minded Tolman followers. Currently, Bandura is a Professor of Psychology at Stanford University. His work on 'social learning,' which was started by his 'bobo-doll' studies, is widely known. Many expect his presidential address in 1972 to both explain his notion of 'vicarious reinforcement,' and articulate the relationship between his behavioristic approach and Miller's new 'cognitive psychology'.

Bandura was elected as a Fellow of the APA in 1964.

##### Harry Harlow, PhD Professor of Psychology, University of Wisconsin

Initially 'former' president, serving on the board of directors.

Harlow is most well known for his series of experiments on separation anxiety in baby rhesus monkeys, Harry Harlow has become one of the most important advocates for behaviorism in the APA today.  Harlow's primate lab at the University of Wisconsin is widely recognized as one of the top places for training young researchers in experimental psychology.  Harlow won the Society for Experimental Psychology's Howard Crosby Warren medal in 1956 and the National Medal of Science in 1967.  He served as President of the APA in 1970.

##### Evelyn Hooker, PhD  Emeritus Professor of Psychology, UCLA 

Evelyn Hooker studied with Karl Meunzinger and Robert Yerkes, pioneers in the fields of animal behavior. Starting in the 1950s, Hooker became interested in human sexuality. In 1953, she won a grant from the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) to study the mental health of 'non-patient, non-inmate homosexuals'.  Hooker showed that if homosexuality itself were removed from the diagnostic information, homosexual men were no more likely to be diagnosed as 'neurotic' than heterosexual men.

On the program for the first class with Dr. H. Anonymous as a panelist on the topic 'Psychiatry: Friend or Foe to Homosexuals: A Dialogue'

Initial member of the Program committee, term expiring 1972.

#### Cognitivists

##### Noam Chomsky, PhD Professor of Linguistics, MIT

In 1971, Noam Chomsky is a quickly rising star in the academy. Currently a professor of Linguistics at MIT, his work is revolutionizing the field, changing the very idea of linguistics from the descriptive study of existing languages to the understanding of how languages result from formal (logical) rules. Chomsky is also a harsh critic of Skinner's radical behaviorism. His review of Skinner's 'Verbal Behavior' is widely seen as a devastating blow to behaviorism. It is contained in the appendix.

##### George Miller, PhD Professor of Psychology, Harvard 

President of the APA in 1971. When the game begins, Miller is serving on the board of directors and responsible for the Presidential address to open the first game session. Miller was trained in behaviorism, but, in part because of his friendship with Chomsky, has developed a new approach he calls 'Cognitive Psychology.' Miller has a side interest in the history of psychology, having worked with E.G. Boring and authored Psychology: the science of mental life.

#### Independents

##### George W. Albee, PhD Professor of Psychology, University of Vermont (Psychologist)

Clinical Psychologist.  Albee worked as the executive secretary for the APA from 1951-1953, along side Harry Harlow's wife. Many of the committee structures and procedures followed today were actually refined by Albee during his time as secretary.In the 1950s, he chaired a task force to survey the resources available to mental heath professionals. The astonishing clarity of the resulting report, along with Albee's unwavering commitment to preventative mental health practices caused a great stir in psychiatric and psychological circles.

Author of 'A declaration of independence for psychology' (1964), Albee is a major figure in the often 'acrimonious' debate regarding the suitability of the medical model for understanding mental illness. If any questions arise regarding the APA's decision-making procedures, Albee is the person to ask.  He has held every position of responsibility in the organization save the Presidency and Vice-Presidency.

Kenneth Clark, along with his wife  Mamie Phipps Clark, are the authors of a hugely famous study of the racial attitudes of young children. Ken and Mamie presented four identical plastic dolls that different only with respect to color to black children between the ages of three and seven. When asked which doll they preferred, the majority selected the white doll. When asked to color in a drawing 'the same color' as themselves, most of the black children choose yellow or white crayons. Ken Clark testified as an expert in three of the five cases that were combined into the landmark school desegregation decision Brown v. The Board of Education, and his summary was cited by Chief Justice Warren (footnote 11) as influencing the court's decision.

Your Biography
Charles Socarides' Biography
When you were 13, you read a biography of Sigmund Freud and immediately decided to become a psychoanalyst. You were trained in Psychoanalytic Medicine Columbia University Center for Psychoanalytic Training and Research, graduating in 1952.
You have been practicing psychoanalysis in New York City since 1954, focusing on the treatment of homosexuality. You report that 'about a third' of your patients became heterosexual after psychoanalytic treatment. Following Freud, you believe that homosexuality is a neurotic adaptation to unresolved conflict, usually originating in the Oedipal stage of development.  You do not argue that homosexuality is immoral in the sense of 'against god's will' or anything like that, you simply believe that it is a maladapation to normal development. You actually see yourself as an advocate for homosexuals, for you do not believe homosexuality is criminal or immoral, you believe it an illness like any other.
According to a 1995 interview in the NY Times “Socarides offered the closest thing to hope that many gay people had in the 1960s: the prospect of a cure. Rather than brand them as immoral or regard them as criminal, Socarides told gay people that they suffered from an illness whose effects could be reversed.”
Irving Bieber's Biography
You were born in New York City in 1909. You graduated from New York University Medical College in 1930, but went on to work at Yale Medical College, New York University, and starting in 1953 at the New York Medical College, where you taught a course in psychoanalysis.  Your 1962 book Homosexuality: A Psychoanalytic Study of Male Homosexuals is, in many ways, a response to the Kinsey Report. It reports on you study of 106 male homosexuals and 100 male heterosexuals seeking psychoanalysis for various problems.
In 1970, you attended a meeting of the American Psychiatric Association in San Francisco that was disrupted by gay activists, one of whom called you a "motherfucker." According to Charles Socarides, you took this very hard after having "been working all these years to help these people." In 1973, you told an interviewer that "a homosexual is a person whose heterosexual function is crippled, like the legs of a polio victim." You believed that, "although this change may be more easily accomplished by some than by others, in our judgment a heterosexual shift is a possibility for all homosexuals who are strongly motivated to change.”
Your View
You are a Freudian, through and through. But more than that, you are a leader in the psychoanalytic treatment of homosexuality.  Your theory, that male homosexuality resulted from suppressed feelings of rejection caused by a cold, distant father and a misidentification of gender identity because of an overbearing mother, is orthodoxy.  Not only has it become  the popular notion of homosexuality in the public discourse, but it informs dominate treatment paradigm in the psychoanalytic community.
It is not, however, Freud's view.  Your theory is 'Freudian,' not Freud.  And it is worth pointing out that the theoretical explanation and treatment paradigms for homosexuality are different in England and Europe.
Freud mentions homosexuality a number of places in Introductory Lectures on Psychoanalysis, and it is crucially important that you study these carefully.  Freud believes that sexual life of children, which is regarded at the time as 'normal' includes a number of activities that would later in life be viewed as 'perverse', including same-sex contact.  In Freud's theory, heterosexuality develops with puberty in normal people. In 'inverts' or homosexuals, something goes wrong in this development. The object of ones' 'natural' desire--the genitals of the opposite sex—becomes transformed into parts of the body that represent those parts in the same sex.  Thus, homosexuality is no different in psychological mechanism than a foot fetish or any other neurotic 'perversion' (see p. 376-384 of Introductory Lectures) Homosexuality is not a psychologically isolated condition. According to Freud:
“We are compelled, however, to regard the choice of an object of one's own sex as a divergence in erotic life which is of positively habitual occurrence, and we are learning more and more to ascribe an especially high importance to it.” (p. 381)
In short, homosexuality is a kind of neurosis, yet it is not, itself, particularly worrying. The action itself is merely 'habitual,' and hence can be cured through standard habit-blocking therapy (Freud suggests that paranoia stops homosexuality on p. 381 of the Introductory Lectures).  It is, however, invariably an indicator of deeper psychological problems, as the transference and substitution of the 'natural' object of sexual desire to a different object will cause neurosis. See Ch 26 of the Introductory Lectures, especially p. 530, for Freud's explanation of homosexuality as neurotic narcissism.
For you, Bieber and Socarides, this theory is transformed somewhat.  You argue, in your 1962 study Homosexuality, that the normal course of development of puberty includes the identification of genders with innate 'active or passive tendencies' (p 4), and then self-identification with one of those tendencies. If a child has an innate tendency towards activity or passivity out of line with his or her gender, he or she is more likely to develop 'homosexual habits'.
At the same time, if an adolescent develops a pathological fear of heterosexual contact—specifically a fear of the gentiles of the opposite sex—that subconscious fear will motivate the ego to transform the object of sexual desire into something that is familiar: a part of the adolescent's own body. These fear are usually the result of some disturbed parent-child relationship. Just as the Oedipal phase is a normal part of development, fear of the opposite sex is a normal part of development. Heterosexuals are those for whom those fears resolve through maturation.
Homosexuals are, then, those who never fully mature in their sexuality, getting stuck at a stage where children are fearful of the other and fascinated with their own bodies. They pathologically project that self-love onto members of their own gender, instead of resolving their fears through heterosexual exploration.
You characterize Freud's theory of the development of homosexuality in three steps:
1.	The autoerotic phase partially persists and object cathexis is partially accomplished, but on a narcissistic level.
2.	Mental attitudes that exist during the phallic stage remain into adulthood.
3.	There are difficulties associated with the Oedipus phase.
It is worth noting that Bieber's analysis was only of male homosexuality.  Freud wrote one study of Lesbianism, which is included in the appendix of the game book.
Regardless of the particulars of your or Freud's view, you are absolutely committed to the thesis that
“All psychoanalytic theories assume that adult homosexuality is psychopathologic and assign differing weights to constitutional and experiential determinants. All agree that experiential determinants are in the main rooted in childhood and are primarily related to the family. Theories which do not assume psychopathology hold homosexuality to be one type of expression of a polymorphous sexuality which appears pathologic only in cultures holding it to be so.” (p 18)
Game Objectives
Complicating matters somewhat, you (Bieber) were once classmates with Judd Marmor!  You were friends then, and that personal relationship may be at stake in this debate.
During your presentations, you must be able to both articulate the current psychoanalytic understanding of homosexuality and its connection to Freud's theory as presented in Introductory Lectures on Psychoanalysis.  You should also be ready to present any evidence that you may have that this theory is accurate.  You'll find that evidence in Ch 2 Bieber's 1962 book, listed under 'Must Read' below.   The first chapter contains Biebers' critiques of the Kinsey study (p. 16), Hooker's study (p. 17),  as well as the movement to declassify homosexuality as a mental illness in the UK (p. 15).
Your theory is summarized in Ch 9 of your 1962 book:
We consider Homosexuality to be pathologic bio-social, psychosexual adaptation to pervasive fears surrounding the expression of heterosexual impulses. In our view, every homosexual is, in reality, a “latent” heterosexual; hence we expected to find evidences of heterosexual strivings among the H-patients in our study.  (p. 220)
As a student, we leave it to you to decide if the evidence presented therein is sufficient motivation for the theoretical mechanism you are proposing.
 As the character, you have to make the best case you can for your position – the audience will determine if the evidence you present motivates the mechanism you defend. You have few, if any, friends in this effort.  We're sorry about that, but it is historically accurate. Marmor and Spiegel have  begun to be successful in separating psychoanalysis from your views on homosexuality. Your job in this game, then, is to advocate for a position that is almost certainly going to lose.  
While you need to make your case, you might want to put most of your energy focusing on something you can win: continuing the dominance of psychoanalysis in psychiatry and allowing treatment for individuals who see therapy for homosexuality voluntarily. The DSM often determines which conditions a therapist can treat in a clinical setting, or get funding to study scientifically. If 'homosexuality' is removed entirely, no one in psychiatry will be allowed to help individuals seeking treatment, or conduct scientific research into homosexuality. Those consequences are things you cannot live with.  
Look back at the definition of 'psychic illness' presented by Freud in Introductory Lectures (p. 445, but quoted in the gamebook 'History of Mental Illness: Freud' section.  For Freud (and Freudians), a psychic illness is something detrimental to one's life as a whole, something that the patient complains about, or that brings the patient displeasure.  Removing homosexuality from the list of mental illness will likely not change these facts for your patients, but you will no longer be allowed to treat them—and that seems to go against your oath as a medical doctor.
If the proposal from Marmor comes to the floor in 1971, present a proposal to stall the vote until after a taskforce conducts a literature review on the efficacy of treatment for homosexuality. You will request total control of that task force, including appointing its members. If you are successful, you will appoint yourself and yourself (Socarides and Bieber).  
You report should present aversion therapy as an effective method for stopping homosexual behavior. This is something of a anachronism for the sake of the game, as Socarides and Bieber were psychoanalysts.  But it's use was widespread in the treatment of homosexuality at the time, and you are the most famous defender of the medicalization of homosexuality.
If you are unsuccessful in getting the taskforce, you can join with Albee in his call for an ad hoc committee to be formed to study the history of the homosexuality in psychology and psychiatry. You're goal here is to make it acceptable to continue to treat homosexuals if they request it, even if it homosexuality itself was not considered a mental illness.
If it looks like the vote to remove homosexuality will pass in 1973 (and it almost certainly will), start collecting 'signatures' on a petition calling for the abdication of that vote, on the grounds that the decision was political (i.e. the board caved to the demands of the activists) and not scientific. If you can get 10% of the class to sign, you may be able to force a postponement or revote.
If the 'Leona Tyler' principle passes in 1973, banning the APA from making taking public positions on things not motivated by evidence, reintroduce your proposals, arguing that the removal of homosexuality was on the basis of politics, not science. If none of this works and 'homosexuality' is removed, and research and treatment of homosexuality is banned by the APA,  quit (in 1975) and found your own private organization called 'NARTH': North American association for Research and Therapy on Homosexuality (as a student, look it up).
Finally, when and if the game gets to a point where the APA attempts to create a definition of ‘mental illness’, work to get a psychoanalytic version passed.  You must also advocate for a theory of mental illness that takes into account the 'natural function' of a body.  Recall Freud's criteria for neurosis: if an individual's psychology is out of step with their biology, it will cause that individual to always be unfulfilled, and hence, will be detrimental to their overall outlook.  A healthy person is one who recognizes his or her own physical function and seeks a life in accordance with those functions.
Specific Assignments
Propose a taskforce to study sexual deviation in 1971, which will report back to the membership in 1973. Your report should summarize and present your Freudian view carefully.
R. Green and J. Spiegel will likely propose a taskforce on the history of homosexuality in psychiatry and psychology that will report in 1972. You should be ready to give an 'official' response to this report.  Marmor probably will as well, so be prepared for a  head-to-head debate in public.
SECRET: you are bound by patient-client confidentiality.  Your patients are not.  This is particularly difficult because many of the street activists who are disrupting meetings are your former patients. No one (other than them) can know that. By your best estimates, your therapy is effective only about 1/3 of the time. Many of your patients are brought to you by their parents. In a classic transference reaction, their anger against their parents is transferred to you, and drives them to classic father-rebellion activities after therapy ends.  
One in particular: Ron Gold, has you concerned. Ron is now a journalist for Variety, and you saw him at the incident in New York arguing with Robert Spitzer. Ron Gold may not be a character, depending on the size of the class.
DSM III: Vehemently oppose any attempt to remove psychoanalytic language from the DSM.

Fission: split to the American Psychoanalytic Association (APsaA).

This section is written for the contemporary reader, not the ‘character’ you’ll be playing. The standards of what makes a good experiment have not changed significantly since the mid 1970s, so there should be no historical anachronisms contained herein.

The image to the right (figure &lt;!--\ref{fig: scientificreasoningexample}--&gt; )is a clipping from the Washington Post published in 2004. It’s one of these succinct summations of scientific research that appear all the time in the media --- there is even a website (http://kill-or-cure.herokuapp.com/) that tracks all the things that the British Tabloid *The Daily Mail* has said either causes or cures cancer.

So what, exactly, is the claim being made here? What evidence is given in support of that claim? If we take the main headline

&gt; Dogged crying and lower IQs are linked

as the central claim---the conclusion, as it were,---of the study that was performed, what would count as evidence in support? Against? 

What, exactly, does it mean to be 'linked' anyway? How are they linked? Does increasing one cause increases in the other?

Fortunately, we have the original journal article for this one available, so I’ll quote the abstract:
&lt;!--\begin{apatextbox}{Abstract from --&gt; [#Rao:2004ku] &lt;!--}--&gt;
**BACKGROUND:**

Long term studies of cognitive development and colic have not differentiated between typical colic and prolonged crying.

**OBJECTIVE:**

To evaluate whether colic and excessive crying that persists beyond 3 months is associated with adverse cognitive development.

**DESIGN:**

Prospective cohort study. A sample of 561 women was enrolled in the second trimester of pregnancy. Colic and prolonged crying were based on crying behaviour assessed at 6 and 13 weeks. Children's intelligence, motor abilities, and behaviour were measured at 5 years (n = 327). Known risk factors for cognitive impairment were ascertained prenatally, after birth, at 6 and 13 weeks, at 6, 9, and 13 months, and at 5 years of age.

**RESULTS:**

Children with prolonged crying (but not those with colic only) had an adjusted mean IQ that was 9 points lower than the control group. Their performance and verbal IQ scores were 9.2 and 6.7 points lower than the control group, respectively. The prolonged crying group also had significantly poorer fine motor abilities compared with the control group. Colic had no effect on cognitive development.

**CONCLUSIONS:**

Excessive, uncontrolled crying that persists beyond 3 months of age in infants without other signs of neurological damage may be a marker for cognitive deficits during childhood. Such infants need to be examined and followed up more intensively.
&lt;!--\end{apatextbox}--&gt;


While the journalist used the word ‘linked,’  the scientific paper makes slightly different claim: that crying “may be a marker” for cognitive deficits during childhood.  This word change---from ‘marker’ to ‘link’---has implications that demand investigation.

The former claim---that ‘dogged crying’ *is linked* to lower IQ---suggests a causal claim: that if you could just stop the child from crying, the child’s IQ would remain normal.  The second---that crying *may be a marker*---suggests that crying is an early sign of an underlying problem that manifests as lower IQ at a later date. The first implies one-way a causal relationship, the second, that both are caused by an underlying problem.

&lt;!--\newthought{The process of drawing upon information,}--&gt; whether acquired through simple observation or through experiment, to answer questions is the crux of the activity of scientific reasoning. The answers to these questions are what scientists refer to as hypotheses.&lt;!--\marginnote{A hypothesis is often defined as an 'educated guess'. This overly-simple definition is really only suitable as a starting point. A hypothesis is a conjecture about the way some phenomenon in the world is or behaves. It might be about the origin of the universe, or the mechanisms of memory, but in either case, the hypothesis claims that something is a certain way. If we discover that the thing is not the way the hypothesis claimed, we have disconfirmed the hypothesis.}--&gt; As one answers these questions one is testing various hypotheses. 

Look back at the ‘Dogged crying’ abstract. You should note that this is study **not** an experiment. The authors of the study did **nothing** other than observe: they made no interventions to the babies or the mothers. They merely separated them into two groups, and measured those groups 5 years later.

This activity is designed for students in research methods and behavior modification classes or the methods section of other content courses. Students observe a brief videotape and collect data on the occurrencdnonoccurrence of a series of six behaviors. The main purposes of this activity are to help students (a) understand the importance of having clear operational definitions, (b) learn to calculate interobserver reliability, and (d think about ways to improve a study that has low interobserver reliability. ln addition, students gain practice in using time sampling and come to realize that observation as a data collection technique is more complex than casual observation.

This exercise heips students realize that observation as a data collection tech- nique is more complex than casual observation. It introduces students to the use of time sampling, the calculation of interobserver reliability, and the importance of having clear operational deftnitions.
You will need a tO-min videotape of human or animal behavior, a VCR and mon- itor for showing the tape to the class, a watch with a second hand, and enough copies of the handouts described later for each student in the class. Students will need pencils and will probably want calcuiators.
To be most effective, the videotape should be of a group of humans or animals that are active enough to produce several different types of behaviors. If at least some of those behaviors occur quite frequently and in several individuals at a time, students will come away with a better understanding of why time sampling is useful. My tape is of a group of white geese at a local park. (I would be happy to provide a copy of this taped segment to anyone who sends me a blank video- tape.) There are many other possibilities for foo-tage that will meet the previously described requirements. For example, you could videotape small children perform- ing at a school program or playing at a birthday pafty, or you could get some footage of one of the livelier species at your local zoo. If you or someone you know is planning to visit another country you may be able to obtain a tape of. festival or other group event from another culture. The videos that some univer- sities make of their graduation ceremonies could also be used. If you have access to a VCR, you could tape a segment of an appropriate televised event. Although
many television programs show groups engaging in behaviors that meet the cri- teria identified at the beginning of this discussion, most do not show this activity, uninterrupted by close-ups of individuals or pans to scenery and other locations

in the story line, for more tban a minute or two. There are exceptions, however, that would make good tapes for this activity: Televised New Year's Eve bashes usually show quite long segments of partyers, sporting events such as basketball or volleyball also show fairly long segments of activity on the court, and dance club shows on cable channels run segments of coupies dancing for the duration of a complete song.
Prepare three handouts. The ffrst should contain a data collection sheet with a row for each observation interval and a column for each behavior students are to record (see appendix A). The second should contain a list of behaviors (I rec- ommend no more than six to eight), their operational definitions {some of which are purposely clearer than others), and a simple formula for inter-rater reliability (see appendix B). The third handout should contain a set of postobsewation ques- tions (see appendix C).
This activity should be prefaced with a lecture on the use of observation tech- niques, including the advantages and disadvantages of time sampiing in relation to other observation techniques (e.g., event sampling and narrative recording) and the concept of interobserver reliability. Although the basic observation techniques described in methods textbooks are much the same, the labels given to particular techniques vary. The following definitions of observation technrques are provided to facilitate gathering background lecture material and to prevent misunderstand- ing.
Time sampling is a technique in which the observer defi.nes several target behaviors, divides the observation period into short intervals, and then alternates from observing to recording every other interval. In contrast, in event sampling the observer deftnes a target behavior and records every instance of that behavior as it occurs throughout the observation period . A narrative recording is a running description of behavior in which everything that is said or done during the ob- servation period is recorded. The following are particularly useful sources for lec- ture material: chapter 5 from Bordens and Abbott 11996l, chapters 5,7, and 8 from Martin and Bateson (1993); and chapter 19 from Martin and Pear (19961.
Give each student all three handouts, and allow them a few minutes to read through the list of behaviors and operational definitions and become familiar with the layout of the data collection sheet. Have students work in 15-s intervals- alternating between 15 s for observing and 15 s for recording observations com- pleted in the previous 15-s interval. For each observation interval, they simply look for whether or not each target behavior occurs. If the behavior occurs at least once in the observation intewal, they are to place a tally mark in the appropriate column on the data sheet during the recording interval. Rather than having stu- dents keep track of their own intervals, use a watch with a second hand to time intervals for them. It works best if you simply call out "observe" or "teeord" at the beginning of alternate lS-s intervals. Explain to students that data collection will last for a total of 10 min. Each minute represents an observation period and is divided into 30-s sessions. During each 30-s session, students will have a 15-s interval to observe the behavior on the videotape and a lS-s intewal to record their observations. It is important for students to understand what they are ob- serving and recording; be sure to explain that they are recording the occurrence of target behaviors. That is, they are looking for whether or not a behavior occuls; they are not looking for the number of times a speciffc behavior occurs.

After 10 min, have students stop observing and work on the postobservation questions {see appendix C). As appendix C illustrates, students will ftrst answer several questions individuall, then compare those answers with a partner, and finally calculate interobserver reliability with their partner for each of the target behaviors.
Follow up with a class discussion of students' responses to the postobservation questions. Focus on those questions where partners' responses differed most often and on those behaviors that had the highest and lowest interobserver reliability. Then discuss possible reasons for these trends. With my tape of geese and set of behaviors, for example, students generally have very high interobserver reliability for displays and for tail shakes and low reliability for feeding and submission. When exploring possible reasons for these findings, student comments tend to focus on the importance of careful operational definitions and on problems with observation. For example, students notice that my operational definition of dis- play behavior is much more concrete than my definition of submission, that the definition for feeding was too narrow to encompass much of what they wanted to be able to code as feeding behavior, and that several of the behaviors were difftcult to identify accurately because of the distance from which the videotape was shot. For example, one student declared that she wanted a better definition of feeding, because "sometimes I thought they might be, but I couldn't see if they really had food in their mouths or not."
Next ask students to offer possible solutions for the reliability problems they have encountered. We talk about clarifying operational definitions. For example, several students decided that "touching beak to the ground several times in a row" would have defined feeding in a way that would have allowed them to record what they thought was feeding behavior. Students also brought up the possibility of reviewing the tape and discussing discrepancies between observers in order to resolve disagreements or practicing with sample tapes to improve reliability be- fore viewing actual data tapes. This second idea was an elaboration on one stu- dent's comment that he "wished we could have watched the whole tape ffrst while reading the definitions and then dane the recording part.'/ The students also decided that the value of a high-power zoom lens should not be underestimated if one wants to observe detailed behaviors and remain unobtrusive. Overall, stu- dents' responses to the activity indicated that not only did they learn a great deal, but that they enjoyed the activity as well.
A minor variation on this activity could allow students to discover for them- selves that one of the pitfalls to time sampling is that there wiil always be lost data (i.e., behaviors that occur during recording intervals rather than observation
) intervals). Instead of having the entire class ijbserve and record during the same I intervals, divide the class in half, and have each half observe and record during I opposite intervals. Have each half of the class pool their data and calculate the I mean number of intervals in which tail shakes, feeding, grooming, display, ag-
t gression, and submission were observed by their group. Students should find that
I
for behaviors that occur frequently, there will be little difference between the means reported by each half of the class. For example, the two halves of the class should be quite similar on mean number of tail shakes, simply because this occurs almost continuously among geese. Horlvever, for relatively infrequent behaviors, such as displays of agglession, students are likely to notice differences between
RESEARcH METHoDS AND srATrsrlcs l59
 Wnrrrruc Cotr,rporuerr
reports by the two halves of the class. This can lead to a discussion of the relative usefulness of time sampling versus event sampling for observing infrequent be- haviors. (Obviously, if you use this alternative procedure and you still want stu- dents to calculate interobserver reliability, they must do so by pairing up with someone from the same half of the class.)
Instructors who want to provide their students with an opportunity to do more writing than the small amount required to complete appendix C may add one of the following writing components to the activity.
l. Have students reflect on their expectations of observation in general and time sampling in particular. AJter giving students a brief description of the exercise they are about to engage in, ask them to respond to the question, "What do you think will happen when we do this time sampling obser- vation?" After the exercise is complete, have students reread their earlier expectations and write a response to the following two questions: (a) "Which of your earlier expectations were met and why do you think this happened?" and (b) "Which of your earlier expectations were not met and why do you think this happened?" As a follow-up, students could construct a list on the chalkboard of the group's most common expectations, identify those that were not met/ and then discuss whether those unmet expecta- tions would make them more or less likely to want to use this method in their own future research.
2. Have students write a report to the researchers who set up the study. In that report, students should point out the strengths and weaknesses of the study and suggest improvements. This writing component could be fol- lowed by a small-group discussion in which students compare the strengths and weaknesses they noticed and try to identify the most meth- odologically sound and practical suggestions for improvement. You could also ask the students to use this small-group time to rewrite the opera- tional deffnitions that they found lacking.
3. Instructors who have their students keep journals might consider having them include an entry about this observation activity. Students could be asked to respond to the question "What do you feei you learned from this observation exercise?" If content analysis is covered in your course, you could have students use these journal responses as data and attempt to code them into categories.

            <Text> THEEAT AND CHALLENGE OF A PRESIDENTIAL ADDRESS
HERE is something about the aura of the Tterm "presidential address" which makes it a special burden and a special source of anxiety for everyone involved. Every speech, ad- dress, article, or essay exposes an important part of oneself for critical examination by an audience or by readers. For a long time, I have tried to per- suade my students that everything that a person writes—all forms of communication—may be viewed as projective materials which reveal aspects of the totality and the complexity of his personality to sensitive observers. If this is true it would follow that to communicate to psychologists, who view themselves as experts in the analysis of per- sonality and character, is to invite not only an analysis of the substance of what one communicates, but also to expose oneself to probing and critical examination. There must be an incorrigible ego drive which propels one to assume the risks of ex- posure to an audience of psychologists, given the fact that the threat of exposure is greater the more accurate are the judgments concerning the character
and wisdom of the speaker.
There remains the problem of how can one make
a presidential address in some way worth the anxie- ties and risks? One could use it as an opportunity to try to clarify the underlying conceptual frame- work implicit in his thoughts, research, writing, teaching, and social action. In one's personal and professional life, it is possible to move from project to project and from encounter to encounter, and to take on a variety of responsibilities and roles with- out having the time to give thought to the theo-

retical and philosophical perspectives which, hope- fully, unify and give some coherence to one's life and activities. It would be reassuring, especially in the latter stages of one's life, to discover that there is theoretical coherence and unity in one's professional activities and his role as a person and as a citizen.
A search for congruence and consistency among the various aspects of one's being would seem man- datory, if not inevitable, for those who are arrogant enough to use the discipline of psychology to legiti- mize their functioning. The luxury and safety of defining scientific objectivity in terms of a detached, disciplined, isolated, and amoral use of human intelligence are not available to those who have chosen to work in the social, psychological, and be- havior sciences or for that matter in the biological and medical sciences.
The research topics, findings, and analyses and insights of a psychologist cannot be divorced from the total complexity of his being. Psychological phenomena do not seem to consist of absolute reali- ties. Their reality is the tantalizing, persistent reality of the subjective. This fact of relativistic reality differentiates the science of psychology from all other sciences. This difference between psy- chology and the physical sciences remains in spite of the fact that the evidence of all sciences—in- deed, the inevitable basis of all knowledge—must be filtered through the limits of human observa- tional powers and refined by limited human intelli- gence.
Psychologists and other social scientists must seek to organize their findings within a conceptual framework which hopefully will expand knowledge and broaden and deepen insights into the nature of man and his society. There remains, also, for psy- chology, the ultimate test of the validity of all sci- ences, namely, a demonstration of an effective tech- nology—the ability to predict or control the phe- nomena which we purport to understand.

cal questions for a contemporary science of psy- chology and for other behavioral sciences are: What arc their contributions to the understanding and control of the behavior of human beings? How can the knowledge, the insights, and the re- lated technology contribute directly or indirectly to effectiveness of individual human beings, to stabil- ity in human society, and increase the chances of survival of the human species?
These are important questions, and there is now a special urgency in finding and implementing af- firmative answers to them within the context of respect for human values. What follows are the views of a person who has spent his adult life in research, teaching, writing, and social action within the discipline of social psychology as to the basis for and the direction within which humane affirma- tive answers might be found. It is also an at- tempt to share with others the process—the intel- lectual and emotional turbulence—by which these views and related suggestions concerning the dy- namics of man and society emerged.
INFLUKNCK OF EARLY RESEARCH ON DICVKLOPJNG JDKAS
My first serious scientific involvement in the larger theoretical concerns with the nature of man and society emerged as a result of the need to interpret the findings of the early research on the nature and development of the self and the problems of ego and racial identification. In these studies 1 was a collaborator with my wife, Dr. Mamie Clark. This fascinating and somewhat illusive "pure" re- search problem was initially my wife's Master's thesis problem. As she saw the larger implications of the first stages of this work, she was kind enough to invite me to join her in a more probing empirical and theoretical exploration of the nature and determinants of the self-image.
As we collected and analyzed the data obtained through the methods we used, we became im- pressed with the implications of the observation that in the initial stages of the emerging sense of self in children the substance and the dynamics of the functioning ego were determined almost ex- clusively by external pressures, determinants, and evaluative agents. These findings provided the first clues for insights concerning the fragility, vulnera- bility, dependence, indeed, the pathos of the human ego. This early research on the emergence of self-
awareness and preference in Negro children illumi- nated for us the larger pattern of problems related to ego development in human beings. Among these insights were:
• The functional substance of the self is not in- digenous to the human organism, but is determined by the nature and pattern of human interaction as this is influenced by the status of the individual in a familial and social hierarchical system. (By the way the individual is perceived and generally treated.)
• The qualitative effect of the external determi- nants of the individual's sense of self is inevitably evaluative; that is, the resulting emerging self- image inevitably brings with it a positive or nega- tive sense of the worth of self.
• This positive or negative evaluative component of self is inevitable and pivotal—and in its most primary and basic sense is not controlled by the individual himself but by others over whom he has no control.
• In the most formative and susceptible stage of a child's life, that period within which there is the beginning of the ability to cope with ideas, the idea of the self and the worth and status of the self are inextricable.
• This initial external definition of the nature, worth, and status of self tends to persist through- out the life of the individual, in that it is reinforced by consistent experiences, is internalized as the core of personality, and establishes the patterns of defense and protection which the individual uses in interpersonal and other forms of social interaction.
• In spite of the above, human beings—except those who have been totally defeated by negative evaluation of others and by consistent rejection, or those who are organically deficient—persist in the struggle for self-affirmation and the attainment of that minimum self-esteem required to continue to function as a human being. Tt remains one of the mysteries of psychological science that individual human beings differ—whether markedly or mini- mally is still open to question—in the physical equipment, intellectual strengths and general life force, and other personal resources which they can mobilize in the continuing struggle for personal affirmation and an effective self-esteem.
My research on the social and attitudinal factors influencing memory and recall—related to the larger
 problem of the effect of social factors on percep- tion and cognition—tended to reinforce my ideas concerning the fragility of the human ego. This early study, conducted in partial fulfillment for the doctorate at Columbia University incidentally, not only anticipated some of the later research on cog- nitive styles but also foreshadowed some of the concerns of the Women's Liberation movement in the finding that men and women differed markedly in the recall of the activities of a dominant woman. The finding that human beings tended to recall events in terms consistent with their attitudes and within the context of their personality seemed to
provide further supportive evidence of the human need to use all available sensory and intellective resources in the attempt to obscure the tenuousness of our being—and to assert an inner certainty and absoluteness as having reality and existence pri- marily because they are asserted.
Further studies of the effects of social pressures and the consequences of rejection and acceptance of individuals and groups by the larger society culmi- nated in the publication of Dark Ghetto. While the writing of Dark Ghetto drew on earlier research in- sights, this specific study of the psychological ef- fects of a ghetto community resulted in a more focused picture of the effects of adverse, persistent social negatives on the distortion of personality and on the impairment of psychological effectiveness of the victims of persistent rejection. Here, again, the persistent fact of the fragility and vulnerability of the human ego, somewhat tempered by insights con- cerning the counterstruggle for self-esteem and resilience of human beings, was reinforced by the
findings of this community psychology research.
It may be of some value to point out that the earlier studies of the development of self-identifica-
Ghetto research on the other hand, from its incep- tion, was clearly motivated by the desire to influ- ence social policy and influence the decisions of those with power to facilitate, block, or determine the rate of desired social change. The Dark Ghetto study cannot be described with candor as an exer- cise in "pure" research on a problem of culture and personality. This study of the dynamics of a sys- tematically dehumanizing community on the hu- manity and effectiveness of the personalities con- fined within it was not conducted without concern for the implications of these findings for social jus- tice and social change.
The Harlem Youth Opportunities (HARYOU) report, Youth in the Ghetto, expanded and revised into Dark Ghetto, was modeled after investigations in public health and preventive medicine. These reports did seek to analyze and describe the effects of social policy and practice; diagnose the nature and manifestations of social instability; and sug- gested remedies for the persistent social insensitivi- ties and resulting pathologies which robbed human beings of self-esteem, reinforced negative self-im- ages, and destroyed the chances of personal and social effectiveness.
In a recent analysis of a sample of antipoverty programs—A Relevant War Against Poverty, co- authored with Jeannette Hopkins—it was clear that the Dark Ghetto findings had influenced the ra- tionale and programmatic structure of federally funded antipoverty and community-based action programs. But, this detailed study of these pro- grams within the first two years of the programs' existence predicted their failure by revealing the controlling and inhibiting fact that those human beings with power are deeply unwilling or unable to share even a modicum of real power with those who

Antipoverty programs based on these social realities were doomed to failure be- cause they reflected a total lack of commitment to eliminate poverty, to share power with the power- less. Above all, they reflected the inability of the
 1050 AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGIST
decision makers and the society as a whole to change the set of perceiving and treating the poor and dark-skin minorities as justifiably rejected in- ferior human beings. These programs did not and would not operate in terms of the rationale and the goals of the potential equality of all human beings. They did not seek to accept and strengthen the humanity of the deprived through compassion, empathy, and a serious sharing of power.
AN EMERGING CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK
There is no doubt that these research projects, the developing ideas, and the related forms of so- cial action were influenced most, fundamentally by the psychodynamic theories of Alfred Adler. The late Francis Cecil Sunnier, Professor of Psychology at Howard University, introduced me to the ideas of Adlcr. It was Professor Sumner who first intro- duced me as an undergraduate to the promises of the science of psychology for the understanding of man and society. It was he who gave me my first serious appreciation of the complexities of the meanings of humanity. In his characteristic style, Professor Sumner presented Adler's thoughts with- in the framework of other psychoanalytic and psychodynamic theories and within the larger con- text of religion and philosophy. This experience had a profound influence on my thoughts, research, and professional and personal action.
The gestalt, wholistic, and organismic theories also exerted a strong influence on my developing ideas. Kurt Goldstein's ability to interpret his ob- servations of the meaning of the symptoms of the brain-injured patients in a unified psychodynamic perspective of the struggle of human beings to maintain an integrated ego—to minimize their deficiencies and maximize their available assets— reinforced the basic significance of Adlerian and organismic theory in my thinking. As one of Gold- stein's graduate students at Columbia University, f struggled to understand his lectures. T admired his ability to present and document a wholistic, organismic view of man as a biosocial organism.
pelled me more toward the social-psychological em- phasis of Adler and made me somewhat resistant to the Freudian emphasis on deeper intrapsychic dy- namics. In its emphasis on innate instinctive processes and its related inability to emphasize the effects of social problems and continued social pres- sures on the individual's effectiveness, traditional Freudian theory seemed inadequate—limited and constricted—for a dynamic social psychology. Freudian theory does not appear to offer a theo- retical basis for a psychology concerned with so- cial change or a psychotechnology other than one- to-one psychoanalytic therapy. Adler's concern with man's social interaction and his emphasis on the human struggle for self-esteem were much more compatible with my main research and action in seeking a humane technology to enhance the chances of humanity among men. The quest for a more enlightened social policy, morally and rationally determined social change, could not proceed from the premise that man is a totally or primarily non- rational organism whose most powerful drives are instinctive and animalistic. In this regard, my re- sistance to the Freudian perspective of man and society was not unlike the objections of the late Gordon Allport who refused to accept the Freudian view of man as an essentially nonrational being. Allport insisted that the rational components of the complexities of human motivation must be given at least an equal if not a dominant role with the non- rational.
The core Adlerian idea which persists in its influence on my thinking is the idea concerning the nature of psychological power in understanding human beings and human society. Bertrand Rus- sell's assertion that "the fundamental concept in social science is Power, in the same sense in which Energy is a fundamental concept in physics" rein- forced the influence of Adlerian theory in my think- ing. In his not too well-known book, Power, Bertrand Russell stated, "The laws of social dy- namics are—so I shall contend—only capable of being studied in terms of power in its various forms." He defines power rather pragmatically as "the production of intended effects."
In earlier exploration of the phenomenon of so- cial power, T defined it operationally as "the force or energy required to bring about, to sustain or to prevent social, political or economic change." As
In spite of the more dramatic, fashionable, pro-
vocative, and, in many respects, profound ideas of
Freud, my thoughts and scientific activities were
only peripherally influenced by the fundamental
Freudian premises. My persistent concerns with
the effects of the social system on the functioning
and effectiveness of individuals and groups pro- my research and my interest in social change in-
 terests tended to converge and eventually fuse, I became preoccupied with the problem of a theory of social power as a unifying conceptual framework. More and more I tended to see social power, in its manifest forms, as that force or combination of forces which facilitated, blocked, or determined the rate and direction of social change. In a dynamic social situation, power expresses itself as a gestalt or a quantum expression of the power aspirations and competition among significant individuals and groups.
need to use the crutches of racial cruelty and ex- tremism are also forlorn, deprived, desperately pa- thetic human beings.
When one dares to confront the many examples of the mocking pathos of power, one finds oneself going beyond Adler even as he remains dependent upon fundamental Adlerian insights. The Adlerian emphasis on the affirmative struggle for self-esteem and status becomes intensified by the disturbing, almost intolerable reality that a positive self-esteem, what Freud calls narcissism, is not determined by forces inherent within the human organism, but is dependent upon external supports and reinforce- ments, and controlled by the judgments of others who themselves are also afflicted with the universal human anxiety of self-doubt.

strengthens the cycle of self-defeating obsession with power.
A contemporary example of human power pathos is found in the anguished cries of the advocates of black power. In this phenomenon it is clear that the verbalizations of power betray the reality of powerlessness. The frustrations, the rejection, the denial of the ability to fulfill legitimate aspirations are compensated for among extreme advocates of black power by the posture and the delusional rhet-
oric of a power which is persistently denied them. This insight into the nature of this particular form of diversionary pseudo-power paradoxically led me into a more empathic understanding of the human pathos and psychological predicament of white racial extremists. Through my understanding and racial identification with compensatory black ex- tremists, I came to understand that whites who
awareness, evaluation, self-reflection, anxiety, re- flection on the past, and anticipation of the future. They are unique in that they make the human ego real—sometimes painfully real. They create and validate humanity, and they sustain the struggle for justice and decency in human relationship even as they provide the basis for rationalizing cruelties and inhumanity.
To make these abstractions real, these mysterious human cortical cells require a rather specific bio- chemical environment. They require that oxygen and nourishment be provided and regulated through an elaborate capillary system. The unstable equi- librium within and around these cells must be main- tained within a tolerable range of variation if the human ego and the complexities of function and continuity inherent in the sense of self are to be sustained.
The essence of the human predicament is the
man consciousness is the mysterious substances and the quality of interactions among the human corti- cal cells. All we seem to know about these cells is that they are unique among all of the combinations of matter and energy which are known to exist in
 1052 AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGIST
The normal functioning and the identity of the self can be disrupted through one or any combina- tion of disturbances within the internal environ- ment. Disruption in continuity of a personal iden- tity--loss of social and psychological continuity and existence—can occur in spite of the continuation of biological existence if there is any significant depri- vation in the specific biochemical requirements of these cortical cells. With such deprivation there can be changes in temperament and fundamental changes in the threshold of positive and negative responses or sensitivity to external environmental
forces.
Jn shorl, these cortical cells hold within them
the keys to the mystery of the definition and the functional quality of the self. They control by their ability to intensify, reduce, or obliterate the basic reality that is the self. And they are fragile. And it is upon the basis of their fragility that the human ego remains a fragile and delicate thing. To be human is not determined merely by the con- cretes of sensory functions, neural integration, and skeletal muscular behavior of the human organism. The essence of being human is defined by the nor- mal functioning of the uniquely complex human brain.
These insights are fraught with anxieties and probably should best be handled by denial or re- pression. Even before the ennui of youth became a fashionable topic of discussion, one of my students once suggested in a brilliant paper for my class in human motivation that the fundamental fear of man was the fear of confronting the void within. The sense of inner emptiness, a sense of limited experiential time, a sense of essential powerlessness, as the basic realities of the human experience—
these arc not tolerable insights. They must be compensated for with more positive, substantive concepts of self. Fortunately, the human brain that made this human predicament possible can also create, invent, or rationalize idcational substance up to and including indefinite continuity for the human ego.
The idea of the void within is abhorrent. The void must be filled. The creative activities of man —his religion, his philosophy, his art, hisliterature, his buildings, his cults, his cruelties, his science, his
objectifications of the inner turbulence of man. In proving to himself that his life is more than the continuous transformation of one form of biological and chemical energy into other forms of physical and behavioral energy, man seems compelled to mobilize and use psychological and social power constructively or destructively. The alternative would be to accept a level of desperation and stag- nation, indistinguishable from psychological death.
Among the paradoxes of the human predicament is that these disturbing insights, complicated as they are by the inevitability of evaluation inherent in the operation of human consciousness, demand that the human beings define human existence in terms greater than an interval between the acci- dents of conception and birth and the infinite noth- ingness of death. The mysterious power and forces which culminate in human consciousness insist that to be human is to be more than the awe- some and finite mystery of existential life. Human beings must affirm humanity and assert that there is purpose to and sacredness to human life despite
all threatening evidence to the contrary. This is the dynamic and the compensatory pathos of power. Affirmation in spite of—is the common denominator of human creativity and destructiveness; of human love and kindness and human hostility and cruelty; of human compassion and human egocentric postur- ing and bombast. It provides the basis for all that is sacred and barbaric in man.
In his discussion of the psychic fictions which arc essential in providing substance to human psy- chological existence, Adler stated in his Under- standing Human Nature:
We can realize how relative are the values of sensations, when not even these are absolute quantities; these elements of our psychic activity are influenced by the striving for a definite goal, our very perceptions are prejudiced by it, and are chosen, so to speak, with a secret hint at the final goal toward which the personality is striving.
We orient ourselves according to a fixed point which we have artificially created, which does not in reality exist, a fiction. This assumption is necessary because of the inade- quacy of our psychic life. . . . Tn the case of all psychic fictions we have to do with the following: we assume a fixed point even though closer observation forces us to ad- mit that it does not exist. The purpose of this assumption is simply to orient ourselves in the chaos of existence, so
that we can arrive at some apperception of relative values. The advantage is that we can categorize every sensation and every sentiment according to this fixed point, once we
technologies--are attemps to fill this void or to
obscure its existence. Human civilizations are have assumed it.
 These psychic fictions, these ideational inventions and objective creations of man which constitute his culture and civilizations, ordinarily seem sufficient to quell temporarily the incipient anguish of the imminence of nonbeing. They frequently postpone the ultimate embarrassment of the acceptance of personal and collective nonimportance.
Of all the compensatory protective agents in- vented or created by the human brain as a cushion against the intolerable realities of human flimsiness, probably the most flexible and effective has been the idea of God. Man has invested God with both omnipotence and permanence. An analysis of the characteristics of God, the powers and functions of God, betrays the pathos and the vulnerability of man. One of the most important functions of God is that of protecting man against accepting and coming to terms with the realities of human limi- tations. In a most literal and basic psychological sense, God is the primary source of power for man. Man created God to create man with introjective strengths, with solidity, and with purpose and sub- stance. To perform this awesome and important task there must be an ideationally literal God. If for no other reason, therefore, God is not only not dead, man cannot permit God to die. If God were to die, human beings would have to die psychologi- cally, even though alive as organisms.
The importance of God as a protection against the fragility of the human ego is revealed in the demigods, the directly observable gods, created by the human mind and also invested with protective power. Magicians, medicine men, priests, bishops, kings, generals, father figures, movie stars, all serve similar if not identical divine functions. These charismatic figures, these personifications of power, are anointed and given virtues and powers beyond those found in ordinary men. Through identifica- tion with them and their projected power, the average man can obscure his weaknesses and affirm his ego. These human gods sometimes internalize the god-like powers attributed to them. They soon believe and act as if they are gods—or are required to engage in a continuous struggle against this tantalizing temptation. From this point of view, paradox emerges as the major characteristic or quality of a bemused God—a God of the inescap- able practical joke of the human predicament.
A similar protective and power brokerage func- tion is played by the variety of groups that human
beings have invented and emotionally identified with. Tribes, cults, religions, nations, and their coercive and protective dogmas and ideologies may be seen as group gods, which bestow substance and strengths upon otherwise vulnerable individuals. The strength and power of a group seem directly proportional to the degree to which it can compen- sate for the fragility or obscure the insignificance and pathos of its individual members. These group benefits appear to be enhanced by the group's dem-
onstrated ability to exercise power over and inflict cruelty upon other groups of human beings.
SOCIAL POWER: A STRUGGLE FOR INTEGRATION FOR ORGANISMIC AND SOCIAL SYSTEMS
There is the tendency among many of us who are concerned with studying more systematically the crucial role of social power in human affairs to present our case as if power is the only significant motivational force and as if it can operate in isola- tion from the total complexity of structure and integrated functions of organismic and social sys- tems.
A realistic view of social power requires that it be seen as a pervasive and integrative force, oper- ating in relationship to other forces in the dynamic constellation of the human personality.
Personality is defined here as the characteristic way in which the individual human organism mo- bilizes and uses all of its available resources in its struggle for survival, satisfaction, status, meaning, and moral integrity.
This definition suggests a hierarchy of the moti- vational components of personality: in this hier- archy, power or status needs fall midway between the more primitive drives toward survival and sensual satisfactions and the uniquely human mo- tives of the quest for meaning and moral integrity. Power may, therefore, operate toward either end of the motivational continuum to reinforce or make dominant either the primitive or the human pro- pensities of man. Power may make stark and rigid, or determine fixation on or regression to, one or another of the other motivational levels; and it may determine the pattern of relationship among the motivational levels. It can also intensify, ob- scure, or contaminate one or more of them as they function in the dynamic system of interaction which is the totality of the personality. Power

and status needs can determine whether other needs will be gratified in animalistic, egocentric, or non- adaptive ways or in human, empathic, and socially constructive channels.
This is the dilemma of power from whence the pathos of power arises.
CONTEMPORARY CRISES OF THE PATHOS OF POWER
Power cannot be exercised without inducing some form of reaction or counterreaction. Social power in its manifest forms, therefore, almost always in- volves confrontations and conflicts; and generally results in either accommodation, with or without residual resentment; or in acute defiance, sporadic counterreaction, or prolonged and smoldering re- sistance. This is the psychodynamic base for the cycle of power: reaction to power and counter- reaction.
The rewards of the exercise of power are transi- tory, and the gratifications of power and status needs are frequently nonadaptive and self-defeating. The following arc some specific symptoms of the nonadaptive pathos, futility, of power.
1. When the exercise of power does not, in fact, increase or when it interferes with the chances of gratifying the more basic needs of survival and satisfaction.
2. When the exercise of power is ambiguous, ran- dom, arbitrary, regressive, disproportionately in- tense and rigid in spite of consequences.
3. When the exercise of power becomes so func- tionally autonomous and extreme in its intensity as to subvert and pervert the critical, rational, and moral capacities of individuals and groups.
4. When the attainment of the symbols of power or the unchallenged actuality of power results in a sense of futility and ennui and the dissipation of the desire or the capacity to use power construc- tively or creatively.
The continuation, intensification, and cumulative effect of any combination of these symptoms are major threats to the organism or the social system. This crisis betrays the fact that the power system has become self-directing and is no longer being controlled by the organism and social system in terms of their adaptive needs. The survival of the system would then seem to depend on its capacity to redirect the power drives and channel their energy toward constructive ends within the im- perative period of time.
Certainly, the normal brain has the necessary survival alert systems which ordinarily can be put into operation to prevent the organism from pur- suing rigidly the paths of self-destruction. Whether the brain of man can provide the basis for resolv- ing the contemporary survival crises of social power positively and constructively remains a mat- ter of conjecture. It is a mocking fact that the human brain can provide intellectual and moral rationalizations for a nonadaptive, ultimately de- structive use of social power. It can invent ideational, delusional realities that provide the crutches for the fragile human ego. It can justify human pomp and pretense as a myriad of non- rational forces propels man toward disaster. But the human brain is also the only source of positive alternatives—alternatives to personal anxieties, hu- miliations, intergroup tensions, violence—alterna- tives to suicide, homicide, and the barbarities of war.
Contemporary man's technological mastery of matter and energy, and the related ultimate thermo- nuclear weaponry, confronts us with the fact that it is now possible to destroy the human species through the nonadaptive use of human intelligence and the destructive, pathetic use of social power. This threat is so ultimate and so urgent that it is understandable that human beings would seek to deny or repress it in order to continue to function as if it did not exist. But it does exist. And it must be handled if human beings are to be able to function without the gnawing and debilitating anxieties inherent in the imminence of extinction.
This survival crisis requires immediate mobiliza- tion of all that is positive within man to provide us with the time necessary to prevent man from destroying the human species—and to provide man with the time required to evolve and to develop a more stable organismic base for the rational and moral exercise of social power.
ERA OF PSYCHOTECHNOLOGY
The present generation of human beings is re- quired to develop psychological and social sciences with that degree of precision, predictability, and moral control essential to the survival of man. The awesome advances in the physical and biologi- cal sciences have made psychotechnology impera- tive. Man can no longer afford the luxuries of a leisurely, trial-and-error, trivia-dominated approach
 THE PATHOS OF POWEE 1055
to the behavioral sciences. The behavioral sciences results but that they require continuous reinforce-
are now the critical sciences; they will determine the answer to the ultimate moral question of human survival.
Given the urgency of this immediate survival problem, the psychological and social sciences must enable us to control the animalistic, barbaric, and primitive propensities in man and subordinate these negatives to the uniquely human moral and ethical characteristics of love, kindness, and empathy.
The redirecting of power away from the absurd, the pathetic, and the self-defeating can be and now must be seen as a responsibility and goal of science and psychotechnology. We can no longer afford to rely solely on the traditional, prescientific attempts to contain human cruelty and destructiveness. The techniques and appeals of religion, moral philos- ophy, law, and education seemed appropriate and civilized approaches to the control of man's prim- itive and egocentric behavior in a prenuclear age. They are, in themselves, no longer appropriate because they permit too wide a margin of error and a degree of unpredictability that is rationally in- consistent with the present survival urgency. Fur-
thermore, moral verbalizations of the past have been prostituted by the pathos of power; they have been perverted by the pretenses of rationality in the service of inhumanity if not barbarity.
The traditional perspective and training of psy- chologists, educators, and moral philosophers would lead them to continue to argue that moral controls of human primitive and egocentric impulses be sought by redoubling our efforts in developing more effective forms of moral education designed to pro- duce individual human beings with ethical autonomy and integrity. They would argue that it is still possible to preserve human civilization by training human beings toward a higher quality of inter- personal relationships; by developing within indi- vidual human beings greater personal and social effectiveness through greater ego strengths. They would continue to assert that a variety of be- havioral modification techniques, imposed particu- larly in childhood, could be expected to reinforce altruism, empathy, and group commitment and sub- ordinate egocentricity in normal human beings.
An objective appraisal of the results of these approaches to a control of the negatives in man and the enhancement of his positives would seem to suggest that not only are they unpredictable in
ment and a prolonged period of time in order to demonstrate positive results. We do not now appear to have the amount of time which these techniques require for hoped-for success.
This present era of psychotechnology comes with the abrupt recognition of this fact of a very limited time within which the human brain can obtain and use that knowledge required to control, protest, and affirm humanity with precision and predictability. Already there are many provocative and suggestive findings from neurophysiological, biochemical, and psychopharmacological and psychological research. The work on the effects of direct stimulation of certain areas of the brain; the role of specific areas of the midbrain in controlling certain affects; the effects of certain drugs on exciting, tranquilizing, or depressing the emotional and motivational levels of the individual; and the effects of externally in- duced behavioral changes on internal biochemistry of the organism suggest that we might be on the threshold of that type of scientific biochemical in- tervention which could stabilize and make dominant the moral and ethical propensities of man and subordinate, if not eliminate, his negative and primitive behavioral tendencies.
On the basis of the presently available evidence, it is reasonable to believe that this type of precise, direct psychotechnological intervention geared to- ward strengthening man's moral and positive human characteristics could be obtained and implemented within a few years, and with a fraction of the cost required to produce the atom bomb; and much less than the present cost of our explorations in outer space.
It is here being suggested that with the mobiliza- tion of the necessary scientific personnel, financial resources, and research facilities, it is now possible —indeed, imperative—to reduce human anxieties, tensions, hostilities, violence, cruelty, and the de- structive power irrationalities of man which are the basis of wars. This contemporary approach to assuring the survival of the human species offers a scientific basis for William James' philosophical wish for a moral equivalence or alternative to wars.
In reducing the negatives and enhancing the posi- tive potentials in human beings, in addition to the political organizational and administrative problems to be resolved, there would be a number of im- portant psychological barriers to be faced and

solved with realism and clue regard lor that essen- tial humanity which differentiates human beings from mere organisms or living machines. The process and techniques of direct biochemical inter- vention or any form of effective psychotechnology must take into account the totality, the inter- relatedncss, the complex gestalt of the human moti- vational, affective, and cognitive system. Jn seek- ing to enhance the positives of empathy and kind- ness and reduce the cruel and the barbaric in man, psychotechnology must not destroy the creative, evaluative, and selective capacities of human beings. Without the desire to explore, to reorganize things and ideas, to vary moods, and to produce, at least with the illusions of flexibility and volition, the human being would indeed be an empty organic vessel and it would be difficult to justify the mere fact of survival under these conditions. In addition to precision and predictability, this suggested psy- chotechnological intervention into human affairs must be affirmatively humane. An inviolable sense of moral responsibility is the essential new in- gredient which this new era of the psychological sciences must bring to the contemporary require- ments of science.
The implications of a precise and predictable psychotechnological intervention into the whole arena of human interaction are of such vast im- portance as to demand that the most careful and rigorous planning, research, and testing precede any attempts to apply these findings on a larger scale. Because these are uniquely human problems with which this program is concerned, the pretest sub- jects would have to be human beings. The impli- cations of an effective psychotechnology for the con- trol of criminal behavior and the amelioration of the moral insensitivities which produce reactive criminality in others arc clear. It would seem, therefore, that there would be moral and rational justification for the use of compulsive criminals as pretest subjects in seeking precise forms of inter- vention and moral control of human behavior. This suggestion is based on the assumption that no human being who is not impelled by some forms of internal, biochemical or external, social forces—or some combination of both—would choose to be a
criminal if he were provided with options.
It is a fact that a few men in the leadership positions in the industrialized nations of the world now have the power to determine among them-
selves, through collaboration or competition, the survival or extinction of human civilization. They can, in fact, exercise this power only within the present limitations of the pathos and contradictions of power for temporary good or unpredictable ulti- mate evil. There is no way of predicting the personal and emotional stability of these leaders with the life and death power over mankind. Nor do we now know the relationship between those personal characteristics which are related to suc- cess in obtaining positions of political and govern- mental power on the one hand and the degree of personal, emotional, and moral stability on the other hand. The masses of human beings are now required to live and continue to work on faith, hope, denial, and the acceptance of the chances that their powerful leaders will have the strength to use their power wisely and morally.
Given these contemporary facts, it would seem logical that a requirement imposed on all power- controlling leaders—and those who aspire to such leadership—would be that they accept and use the earliest perfected form of psychotechnological, bio- chemical intervention which would assure their positive use of power and reduce or block the possibility of their using power destructively. This form of psychotechnological medication would be a type of internally imposed disarmament. It would assure that there would be no absurd or barbaric use of power. It would provide the masses of human beings with the security that their leaders would not or could not sacrifice them on the altars of their personal ego pathos, vulnerability—and in- stability.
It is possible to object to the era of psycho- technology on "moral" grounds and to assert that these suggestions are repugnant because they are manipulative and will take away from man his natural right to make errors—even those errors which perpetrate cruelties and destruction upon other human beings. In the light of the realities of and possible consequences of nuclear weaponry, these allegedly moral arguments seem mockingly, pathetically immoral. It would seem that man could afford to indulge in this type of abstract, pre- scientific moralizing in the past when his most destructive weapons were clubs, bow and arrows, or even gunpowder. To continue this type of thinking in an age when nuclear weapons are capable of destroying millions of human beings in a single
 irrational man-made event would seem to be a form of self-defeating and immoral rigidity.
There could be the further objection that bio- chemical intervention into the inner psychological recesses of motivation, temperament, and behavior of human beings is an unacceptable, intolerable tampering with the natural or God-given character- istics of man. The negative connotations presently associated with discussions of drugs and the drug culture, particularly among young people, could be invoked to support this objection. One could also object on the ground that, in effect, what is here being suggested under the guise of an imperative psychotechnology is just another form of Utopian mechanization of human beings through drugging the masses and their leaders.
These objections seem to be based on semantic grounds rather than on essential substance. In medicine, physical diseases are controlled through medication. Medicines are prescribed by doctors to help the body overcome the detrimental effects of bacteria or viruses—or to help the organism restore that balance of internal biochemical environment necessary for health and effectiveness. Medicines are not only used to treat the diseases of individ-
uals, but arc also used preventively in the form of vaccines. All medicines are drugs—and all drugs used therapeutically are forms of intervention to influence and control the natural processes of dis- ease. Selective and appropriate medication to as- sure psychological health and moral integrity is now imperative for the survival of human society.
The era of psychotechnology, having been im- posed upon man by the physical scientific advances of man, cannot now be avoided. It must be used affirmatively, wisely, and with com- passion. To fulfill these requirements, it must have a sound scientific, factual base. It must also be firmly rooted in rational morality. It must respect and enhance that which is uniquely human in man—those positive qualities which promise a fu- ture of human grandeur. In meeting these and related requirements, a rigorous, tough-minded sci- ence and technology of psychology will save man from the more destructive consequences of his absurdities and propensities—the pathos of power— and will provide him with the time necessary to evolve and stabilize those centers of his brain which will make social morality and human survival no longer a matter of chance.

### Your Biography

You were born in New York City in 1909. You graduated from New York University Medical College in 1930, but went on to work at Yale Medical College, New York University, and starting in 1953 at the New York Medical College, where you taught a course in psychoanalysis.  Your 1962 book Homosexuality: A Psychoanalytic Study of Male Homosexuals is, in many ways, a response to the Kinsey Report. It reports on you study of 106 male homosexuals and 100 male heterosexuals seeking psychoanalysis for various problems.

In 1970, you attended a meeting of the American Psychiatric Association in San Francisco that was disrupted by gay activists, one of whom called you a "motherfucker." According to Charles Socarides, you took this very hard after having "been working all these years to help these people." In 1973, you told an interviewer that "a homosexual is a person whose heterosexual function is crippled, like the legs of a polio victim." You believed that, "although this change may be more easily accomplished by some than by others, in our judgment a heterosexual shift is a possibility for all homosexuals who are strongly motivated to change.”

### Your View

You are a Freudian, through and through. But more than that, you are a leader in the psychoanalytic treatment of homosexuality.  Your theory, that male homosexuality resulted from suppressed feelings of rejection caused by a cold, distant father and a misidentification of gender identity because of an overbearing mother, is orthodoxy.  Not only has it become  the popular notion of homosexuality in the public discourse, but it informs dominate treatment paradigm in the psychoanalytic community.

It is not, however, Freud's view.  Your theory is 'Freudian,' not Freud.  And it is worth pointing out that the theoretical explanation and treatment paradigms for homosexuality are different in England and Europe.

Freud mentions homosexuality a number of places in *Introductory Lectures on Psychoanalysis*, and it is crucially important that you study these carefully.  Freud believes that sexual life of children, which is regarded at the time as 'normal' includes a number of activities that would later in life be viewed as 'perverse', including same-sex contact.  In Freud's theory, heterosexuality develops with puberty in normal people. In 'inverts' or homosexuals, something goes wrong in this development. The object of ones' 'natural' desire--the genitals of the opposite sex—becomes transformed into parts of the body that represent those parts in the same sex.  Thus, homosexuality is no different in psychological mechanism than a foot fetish or any other neurotic 'perversion' (see p. 376-384 of *Introductory Lectures*) Homosexuality is not a psychologically isolated condition. According to Freud:

“We are compelled, however, to regard the choice of an object of one's own sex as a divergence in erotic life which is of positively habitual occurrence, and we are learning more and more to ascribe an especially high importance to it.” (p. 381)

In short, homosexuality is a kind of neurosis, yet it is not, itself, particularly worrying. The action itself is merely 'habitual,' and hence can be cured through standard habit-blocking therapy (Freud suggests that paranoia stops homosexuality on p. 381 of the Introductory Lectures).  It is, however, invariably an indicator of deeper psychological problems, as the transference and substitution of the 'natural' object of sexual desire to a different object will cause neurosis. See Ch 26 of the Introductory Lectures, especially p. 530, for Freud's explanation of homosexuality as neurotic narcissism.

For you, Bieber and Socarides, this theory is transformed somewhat.  You argue, in your 1962 study *Homosexuality*, that the normal course of development of puberty includes the identification of genders with innate 'active or passive tendencies' (p 4), and then self-identification with one of those tendencies. If a child has an innate tendency towards activity or passivity out of line with his or her gender, he or she is more likely to develop 'homosexual habits'.

At the same time, if an adolescent develops a pathological fear of heterosexual contact—specifically a fear of the gentiles of the opposite sex—that subconscious fear will motivate the ego to transform the object of sexual desire into something that is familiar: a part of the adolescent's own body. These fear are usually the result of some disturbed parent-child relationship. Just as the Oedipal phase is a normal part of development, fear of the opposite sex is a normal part of development. Heterosexuals are those for whom those fears resolve through maturation.

Homosexuals are, then, those who never fully mature in their sexuality, getting stuck at a stage where children are fearful of the other and fascinated with their own bodies. They pathologically project that self-love onto members of their own gender, instead of resolving their fears through heterosexual exploration.

You characterize Freud's theory of the development of homosexuality in three steps:

1.	The autoerotic phase partially persists and object cathexis is partially accomplished, but on a narcissistic level.

2.	Mental attitudes that exist during the phallic stage remain into adulthood.

3.	There are difficulties associated with the Oedipus phase.

It is worth noting that your analysis is only of *male* homosexuality.  Freud wrote one study of Lesbianism, which is included in the appendix of the game book.

Regardless of the particulars of your or Freud's view, you are absolutely committed to the thesis that

&gt; “All psychoanalytic theories assume that adult homosexuality is psychopathologic and assign differing weights to constitutional and experiential determinants. All agree that experiential determinants are in the main rooted in childhood and are primarily related to the family. Theories which do not assume psychopathology hold homosexuality to be one type of expression of a polymorphous sexuality which appears pathologic only in cultures holding it to be so.” (p 18)

### Game Objectives

Complicating matters somewhat, you (Bieber) were once *classmates* with Judd Marmor!  You were friends then, and that personal relationship may be at stake in this debate.

During your presentations, you must be able to both articulate the current psychoanalytic understanding of homosexuality and its connection to Freud's theory as presented in *Introductory Lectures on Psychoanalysis.* You should also be ready to present any evidence that you may have that this theory is accurate.  You'll find that evidence in Ch 2 Bieber's 1962 book, listed under 'Must Read' below.   The first chapter contains Biebers' critiques of the Kinsey study (p. 16), Hooker's study (p. 17),  as well as the movement to declassify homosexuality as a mental illness in the UK (p. 15).

Your theory is summarized in Ch 9 of your 1962 book:

We consider Homosexuality to be pathologic bio-social, psychosexual adaptation to pervasive fears surrounding the expression of heterosexual impulses. In our view, every homosexual is, in reality, a “latent” heterosexual; hence we expected to find evidences of heterosexual strivings among the H-patients in our study.  (p. 220)

As a student, we leave it to you to decide if the evidence presented therein is sufficient motivation for the theoretical mechanism you are proposing.

 As the character, you have to make the best case you can for your position – the audience will determine if the evidence you present motivates the mechanism you defend. You have few, if any, friends in this effort.  We're sorry about that, but it is historically accurate. Marmor and Spiegel have  begun to be successful in separating psychoanalysis from your views on homosexuality. Your job in this game, then, is to advocate for a position that is almost certainly going to lose.  

While you need to make your case, you might want to put most of your energy focusing on something you can win: continuing the dominance of psychoanalysis in psychiatry and allowing treatment for individuals who see therapy for homosexuality voluntarily. The DSM often determines which conditions a therapist can treat in a clinical setting, or get funding to study scientifically. If 'homosexuality' is removed entirely, no one in psychiatry will be allowed to help individuals seeking treatment, or conduct scientific research into homosexuality. Those consequences are things you cannot live with.  

Look back at the definition of 'psychic illness' presented by Freud in *Introductory Lectures* (p. 445, but quoted in the gamebook 'History of Mental Illness: Freud' section.  For Freud (and Freudians), a psychic illness is something detrimental to one's life as a whole, something that the patient complains about, or that brings the patient displeasure.  Removing homosexuality from the list of mental illness will likely not change these facts for your patients, but you will no longer be allowed to treat them—and that seems to go against your oath as a medical doctor.

If the proposal from Marmor comes to the floor in 1971, present a proposal to stall the vote until after a taskforce conducts a literature review on the efficacy of treatment for homosexuality. You will request total control of that task force, including appointing its members. If you are successful, you will appoint yourself and yourself (Socarides and Bieber).  

You report should present aversion therapy as an effective method for stopping homosexual behavior. This is something of a anachronism for the sake of the game, as Socarides and Bieber were psychoanalysts.  But it's use was widespread in the treatment of homosexuality at the time, and you are the most famous defender of the medicalization of homosexuality.

If you are unsuccessful in getting the taskforce, you can join with Albee in his call for an ad hoc committee to be formed to study the history of the homosexuality in psychology and psychiatry. You're goal here is to make it acceptable to continue to treat homosexuals if they request it, even if it homosexuality itself was not considered a mental illness.

If it looks like the vote to remove homosexuality will pass in 1973 (and it almost certainly will), start collecting 'signatures' on a petition calling for the abdication of that vote, on the grounds that the decision was political (i.e. the board caved to the demands of the activists) and not scientific. If you can get 10% of the class to sign, you may be able to force a postponement or revote.

If the 'Leona Tyler' principle passes in 1973, banning the APA from making taking public positions on things not motivated by evidence, reintroduce your proposals, arguing that the removal of homosexuality was on the basis of politics, not science. If none of this works and 'homosexuality' is removed, and research and treatment of homosexuality is banned by the APA,  quit (in 1975) and found your own private organization called 'NARTH': North American association for Research and Therapy on Homosexuality (as a student, look it up).

Finally, **when and if the game gets to a point where the APA attempts to create a definition of ‘mental illness’**, work to get a psychoanalytic version passed.  You must also advocate for a theory of mental illness that takes into account the 'natural function' of a body.  Recall Freud's criteria for neurosis: if an individual's psychology is out of step with their biology, it will cause that individual to always be unfulfilled, and hence, will be detrimental to their overall outlook.  A healthy person is one who recognizes his or her own physical function and seeks a life in accordance with those functions.

### Specific Assignments

Propose a taskforce to study sexual deviation in 1971, which will report back to the membership in 1973. Your report should summarize and present your Freudian view carefully.

R. Green and J. Spiegel will likely propose a taskforce on the history of homosexuality in psychiatry and psychology that will report in 1972. You should be ready to give an 'official' response to this report.  Marmor probably will as well, so be prepared for a  head-to-head debate in public.

**SECRET**: you are bound by patient-client confidentiality.  Your patients are not.  This is particularly difficult because many of the street activists who are disrupting meetings are your former patients. No one (other than them) can know that. By your best estimates, your therapy is effective only about 1/3 of the time. Many of your patients are brought to you by their parents. In a classic transference reaction, their anger against their parents is transferred to you, and drives them to classic father-rebellion activities after therapy ends.  

One in particular: Ron Gold, has you concerned. Ron is now a journalist for Variety, and you saw him at the incident in New York arguing with Robert Spitzer. Ron Gold may not be a character, depending on the size of the class.

**DSM III**: Vehemently oppose any attempt to remove psychoanalytic language from the DSM.


**Fission**: split to the American Psychoanalytic Association (APsaA).

            <Title>Controlling extraneous variables</Title>
            <Text>There are several ways possible confounding variables can be dealt with in a study:

&lt;!--\newthought{Locking procedural variables}--&gt; — instructions, aspects of the materials and task, physical setting, apparatus, and so forth, can ‘locked’ by controlling the environment. Ebbinghaus’ ‘locked’ the influence of his own mental associations in particular words by restricting all his memory experiments to the list 2,300 nonsense syllables he had created. 

This can also be used for a limited number of subject variables, such as level in school (first-graders, college students, etc.), diagnostic category (as in a study limited to children with autism), etc. In our study of oatmeal and cholesterol, for example, we might restrict both our experimental group and control group to participants who are taking a difficult course and exercising a lot. Holding the value of these extraneous variables constant ("locking" them) breaks any effect they may have had on the dependent variable in this study. That is, if course difficulty and exercise generally affect cholesterol level, holding them constant is one way to assure that they will not be confounded with the independent variable.

#

&lt;!--\newthought{Using randomization}--&gt; to approximately balance the value of the variable  is used for most subject variables in between-subjects designs, and has the advantage that it works even for variables you would never think about. For example, in our oatmeal and cholesterol study, we might randomly assign subjects to eat or not eat oatmeal. Random assignment should assure that the many variables that can affect cholesterol but are extraneous to the hypothesis are about equally distributed across the two groups. For example, genetic susceptibility and mental stress levels should be similar for the two groups of subjects — those assigned to eat oatmeal and those assigned to refrain from eating oatmeal. You do need large enough samples for this to work well; with small samples, unequal distributions will often occur by chance. Although randomization is usually the preferred technique for controlling subject variables, it may also be relied upon to control certain procedural variables (especially in field experiments).

￼

&lt;!--\newthought{Making The value of the variable a factor in the design}--&gt; In this situation, the possible confounding variable is treated as a separate independent variable. This is most frequently done with the subject variable of gender (making each sample half female and half male), but you can use this kind of control on any procedural, subject, or other variable for which you want absolute certainty that it is balanced across conditions. One advantage is being able to find out whether, or how much, the variable matters. In our oatmeal and cholesterol study, we might decide to control any potential effects of course difficulty by making it a factor. Not only would this ensure that the oatmeal and no-oatmeal groups were equalized on this factor; it would give us a way to test whether course difficulty in fact affects cholesterol level.

￼

##### Assessing Validity

Someone has conducted an experiment. A finding is reported in the newspaper. Perhaps the finding is surprising. For example, a study claims that smoking resulted in a reduction of cancer rates, or that watching violence on TV reduces violent behavior, or that industrial pollution resulted in improvements in human health. You are astounded by the finding. But there was an experiment and the result was published. So you ought to believe it, right?
Perhaps the report was false. No experiment was conducted, or the data was fabricated. But let's assume for the moment that everything is reported accurately. What should we make of the results? There are two questions we need to ask. Was the study done properly so that it found out what was happening? And is the implication drawn from the study justified? Both of these questions are questions about the validity of the experiment. We call the former 'internal validity', and the latter 'external validity'. Both forms of validity must be evaluated before you (or your group or the government) decides to base what to do with the results of the experiment.

&lt;!--\newthought{The first form of validity}--&gt; looks inside the experiment to the design of the experiment. The central question of internal validity is this: Was the experiment designed so as to determine what was really happening?
&lt;!--\begin{thesis}[Internal validity]--&gt;
The extent to which a study’s design ensures that its result will be in accordance with reality. That is, if the suspected cause really is a cause, the predicted effect on the DV is confirmed; if not, the predicted effect on the DV is not confirmed. To ensure this, other possible causes must be well-controlled.
&lt;!--\end{thesis}--&gt;
&lt;!--\newthought{The second form}--&gt;, external validity, looks outside the experiment itself to what conclusions can be drawn from the resulting data.
&lt;!--\begin{thesis}[External validity]--&gt;
External validity: the extent to which a study’s results can be generalized. (Relevant questions include: were the participants sampled from a broad population or narrow one? Were they selected in a way that assured they were representative of the population? How well can we describe the population they were sampled from?)
It is also called:
	•	Generalizability


&lt;!--\end{thesis}--&gt;
&lt;!--\newthought{Any factor other than the independent variable}--&gt; that alters the dependent variable can affect the internal validity of an experiment. Consider, for example, that you are conducting an experiment on to what extent the color of a package affects people's preference for a product. You prepare two separate packages, and present them to a couple hundred volunteers and ask them for their preference. To make data collection easy, you put different labels on the packages. One you label "Oh, so good" and the other "Melt away." Could this difference in name affect the preferences for the packages? It could, and as a result you may not be measuring preference for packaging at all.

Randomizing the assignment of subjects to the experimental and control conditions overcomes many of the potential dangers to internal validity. If randomization is effective, all other pre-existing subject variables that may affect the dependent variable are equalized between the two populations, leaving only the independent variable as the source of difference. With small samples, however, even randomization can result in other factors being unequally distributed between the experimental and control groups. Even if the randomization does equalize all pre-existing factors that might affect the dependent variable, other conditions might arise during the experiment that have an effect. For example, perhaps the experimental and control groups are sent to different rooms, and one is somewhat chilly. That could affect the dependent variable.

Decisions about the independent and dependent variables can also affect validity. Do they measure what you want to measure? If so, did you choose appropriate values of the independent variable? For example, if you ignore most of the range of possible values and choose two values that are very similar, manipulating them may have minimal impact on the dependent variable.

Another set of internal validity concerns arise from two sources of bias. Both experimenter bias and subject reactivity can compromise an experiment. Often, though not always, participants can be kept "blind" as to what condition they are in or what the experimenter expects. If the experimenter also is "blind" as to which participants are in which conditions, it is a "double-blind" experiment. The most familiar example is drug studies, in which neither the participants nor the experimenter know who is getting the investigational drug and who is getting a placebo.

&lt;!--\newthought{For a study to have external validity}--&gt;, its results must be generalizable to the intended target population. But often researchers only study a small part of the target population, or even another population altogether. For example, in both biological and biomedical research, studies are conducted on other species but the conclusions are applied to humans. Before testing a new drug on humans, for example, it is first tested on mice or rats or other creatures. In psychological research, college undergraduates are often used as subjects, but inferences are made about humans in general. This raises the question of how generalizable the results are.

The very fact of an experiment can, with humans, produce results that would not happen otherwise. Imagine that you are walking across campus and a total stranger who looks like a fellow student walks up to you and asks you to turn around and walk backwards for 20 feet. Will you do it? Now imagine that the stranger prefaces her request with “I am conducting an experiment for my psychology class” and then proceeds with the same request. Are you more likely to comply? If so, then compliance in an experiment may be a product of the experiment and not indicative of behavior outside of that situation.

            <Title>Paradigmatic experiments: Newton</Title>
            <Text>###### The first paradigm: Newton’s *experimentum crucis*

The concept of an ‘experiment’ in science is actually relatively new. 

As you may remember from &lt;!--\fullref{prehistoryofpsychology:empiricismaboutthemind}--&gt;, we attribute the birth of the scientific method to Francis Bacon. His study of heat in the *Novum Organon* established a model of scientific reasoning: first, draw axioms from experience; and second, deduce or derive new experiences from those axioms [Bk. II, &lt;!--\S --&gt;X][#Bacon:1620ui]

1. Catalog all the instances of the thing (“Table of existence and presence”, &lt;!--\S --&gt;XI)

2. Catalog all the instances of things similar to the items listed in (1), but lacking heat (“Table of Absence”, &lt;!--\S --&gt;XI)

3. Catalog all the instances of things that do not have heat but could (“Table of degrees or comparative instances”, &lt;!--\S --&gt;XIII)

4. Finally, catalog all the instances of things that heat cannot be (“Table of exclusions”, &lt;!--\S --&gt;XVIII)

Only after these tables are made are we able to make a ‘First Harvest’, a first attempt to generalize across all these tables and interpret nature. Once this is complete, Bacon suggests we create tables of ‘privileged instances’--27 in total, that specify all instances that are solitary, revealing, concealed, etc. The 14th table is a table of ‘crucial’ or ‘critical’ instances.

&gt; We take the term from the *signposts* which are erected at forks in the road to indicate amen mark where the different roads go.  We have also chosen to call them *decisive instances* and *instances of verdicts*, and in some cases *oracular* and *commanding instances*. 

This is where the term *experimentum crucis* comes from, although for Bacon, it was a critical *instance* of observation, not a critical experiment. Robert Hooke, who we now remember for ‘Hooke’s Law’ of springs, was the first to suggest that critical instances could be manufactured in a laboratory, and hence, become *experiments*.

Newton first started his experiments on light and prisms in the early 1670’s, reporting his initial findings to the Royal Society in 1671. [#Newton:1671uw] It is actually his *second* letter on this topic, published in 1672, that is most frequently cited as the primary source. [#Newton:1672tm]. 

It is notable that Newton himself does not use the term *experimentum crucis* in his original presentations of his experiments to the Royal Society in two letters in 1671 and 1672. In 1672-1673, Hooke viciously attacked Newton’s work.  In 1673, Newton was a young man of 30, working primarily in Cambridge, not London.  Hooke was 10 years his senior, an original member of the Royal society and well ensconced in the power structures of London.

But Hooke had a theory of light, was well known to be ‘irascible’, and did not appreciate new-comers. Newton responded in 1672 [#Newton:1672wd], and again in 1673 [#Newton:1673tf]. But even in these, he does not call his experiments ‘crucial’.  He only uses that term in his *Opticks*, written 30 years later and published a year *after* Hooke’s death. [#Newton:2018th]

I mention this because, as most students familiar with Reacting will understand, the *actual* history is far more complicated than the digested version we get in most textbooks. The story Newton tells in the *Opticks* of conceiving of and performing a *crucial experiment* deduced by pure logic from the Bacon’s tables of induction is nothing more than a post-hoc myth.

But like Franklin’s kite, it is the myth, and not the actual history, that matters in understanding Newton’s influence on the development of science. So what did Newton show, and why was it ‘crucial’?

&lt;!--\newthought{The fact that white light}--&gt; that passes through a prism refracts and takes on the colors of the rainbow was well understood in 1670.  What was not understood was whether the colors of the rainbow were existent in the light and ‘revealed’ by the prism, or whether they were in the prism and ‘added’ to the white light as it passed through. In short, is the prism breaking light up, or is it acting as a colored filter?

Roughly, Hooke held the second: that light itself does not contain color, but it took on colors as it was ‘corrupted’ by the prism.  Newton, on the other hand, thought that the light’s color and the angle of refraction were one and the same, and hence, the colors were contained in the white itself, and were only revealed by refraction through the prism.

A ‘crucial’ experiment must act like a signpost. It must distinguish absolutely between the two competing theories---like a fork in the road, at a critical experiment, the two theories diverge and cannot be recombined.
&lt;!--\begin{figure*}\includegraphics{../images/newton1704.png}\caption{Illustration of Newton's experiment contained in the \emph{Opticks}, 1704}\label{fig:newton1704}\end{figure*}--&gt;

Newton and Hooke both predict that light passing through a prism will refract at a distinct angle, and will take on the colors of the rainbow.  What Newton needs is a case in which Hooke predicts one thing, and he the opposite. 

So he sets up the experiment as designed in &lt;!--\ref{fig:newton1704}--&gt;. Newton darkens the room, and opens a small pinhole in a sheet (F) covering the window. The light starts at (S), enters the room through the (F) and passes through prism (ABC). It then falls on sheet (DE), which has a hole (G).  The light coming through G is a single color. It then passes through *another* screen and prism. The resultant angle is measured.  Newton observes, at least in 1672:

&gt;“And I saw by variation of those places that the light, tending to that end of the image toward which the refraction of the first prism was made, did in the second prism suffer a refraction considerably greater than the light tending to the other end.  And so the true cause of the length of that image was detected to be no other than that light consists of rays differently refrangible, which, without any respect to a difference in their incidence were , according to their degrees of refrangibility, transmitted to divers parts of the wall.”

When light passes through the second prism, it is further refracted, but not changed in color. So how does this observation for a fork-in-the-road between his view and Hooke’s? That’s a subject of debate. But here’s my best take at his reasoning:

&lt;!--\begin{apatextbox}{Newton’s Experimentum Crucis} --&gt;
1. Either the colors and their respective angles are in the light itself, and the prism uncovers this fact, or the prism adds the colors and the angles by corrupting the pure white light.

2. If the former, then light passing through a second prism would (a) not change the color (for a color once revealed can’t be revealed again) BUT it would (b) double the angle on the second pass.

3. If the later, the light passing through a second prism would (a) change the color (for the prism adds color to whatever light it touches) AND it would (b) double the angle on the second pass.

4. Passing light through 2 prisms produces the same color as passing light through 1 prism (as well as doubles the angle).

5. Therefore, the colors and their angles are in the light itself 

&lt;!--\end{apatextbox}--&gt;

This experiment---and this reasoning---comes to be *the* standard for a good experimental design. It is the ‘paradigmatic’ experiment of its era, the ‘paradigm’ of good science.  </Text>
            <Comments>Newton himself describes the logic of his *experimentum crucis* like this:

&gt; To determine by Experiments these and such like Queries which involve the propounded theory, seems the most proper and direct way to a conclusion. And therefore I could with all objects were suspended, taken from Hypotheses or any other heads other than these two; of showing the insufficiency of Experiments to determine these Queries or prove any other parts of my theory, but assigning the flaws ad defects in my conclusions drawn from them; or of producing other Experiments which directly contradict me, if any such may seem to occur. For if the Experiments, which I urge, be defective, it cannot e difficult to show the defects. But if value, then by proving the theory they must render all Objections invalid. [p. 5005][#Newton:1672tm]
In contemporary academic English, the word ‘paradigm’ is used to mean, roughly ‘word-view’.  That usage descends from this use of the term, as the modern use can be traced back to Thomas Kuhn’s *Structure of Scienctific revolutions* ([#Kuhn:2012vq]). In it, he describes scientific progress as changing eras in which scientists look to a particular experiment as the best model of scientific reasoning, and seek to replicate that experiment in their own work. That experiment is the ‘paradigm’ for that era of scientific inquiry.  Over time, people started using the work ‘paradigm’ to refer to the era, and the people in it, rather than the experiment they valued. </Comments>

New York University
WANT to talk with you about a psychologist's Iview of a major social change which is taking place in this country. I am referring to the series of events in the South which have followed the Supreme Court's decisions against segregation in
public schools.
As citizens we may consider the Court's rulings
wise or unwise, we may applaud or condemn specific actions taken in the South, we may find the ferment and the turmoil and the apparently inconsistent re- actions in the South fascinating or confusing, or both. But as psychologists our approach must be to consider, on the one hand, whether our available knowledge can contribute to an understanding of what is going on, and, on the other hand, to seek in the changing situation opportunities for research which will increase our understanding of the proc- ess of change in relations between social groups.
I believe that even in the present rather primitive
state of social psychology, we do have knowledge
which would suggest a different interpretation of
events than everyday common sense provides. Take,
for instance, the recent vote in Virginia, in which
residents of that state, by a two-to-one majority,
approved a plan which will make possible the trans-
formation of public schools into what are tech- and St. Louis, which have already undergone de- nically private schools in order to evade the Su- segregation. I do not mean to say that I doubt that preme Court ruling. A correspondent of the New the people of Virginia are opposed to desegregation; York Times, in commenting on the vote, drew the on the contrary, I think the vote is a very clear conclusion that much of the South will not accept expression of that opposition. But I do not think racially integrated schools and that desegregation it provides a basis for predicting what their be-
there will have to be a slow evolutionary process. I am doubtful that this is the correct interpretation; I will shortly suggest another possibility.

havior will be when school desegregation is initiated. I would guess that, if similar votes had been taken in other communities before desegregation was started, the balloting would have been about the same.
Or—what about the school strikes? During the
first weeks of desegregation in Washington and in
Baltimore white children went on strike. Does this
bode ill for future relations between white and
Negro students in desegregated schools in those
communities? The obvious interpretation is that prediction of behavior. The classic example, of the students struck because of their antagonism to
1
association with Negroes. But is this interpreta- tion correct?
And, on a much larger scale—what are the long- range implications of the fact that schools are being desegregated in many communities, and probably sooner or later throughout the South? Many in- terpreters have seen in this event the beginning of the end of racial segregation in the South. How realistic an expectation is this?
I don't know, with any certainty, the answers to these questions. In fact, my main argument is going to be that the significance of the Supreme Court's decision, from the standpoint of a science of psychology, is that it provides a rare opportunity to acquire more of the kind of knowledge we need in order to make better interpretations of such matters than is now possible.
First, however, I want to indicate that I think we already know enough to suggest alternative—though not necessarily correct—interpretations for each of the points I have just mentioned.
Take the Virginia vote. My expectation would be that when school desegregation does take place in Virginia it will be with as little unpleasantness as there has been in places like Washington, Baltimore,
I base my interpretation on a number of studies which suggest that, in the area of race relations, stated opinion is frequently not a reliable basis for
course, is the study in which LaPiere (6), after traveling throughout the United States with a Chinese couple, wrote to the hotels and restaurants which they had visited, asking if the establishment
 would accept Chinese as guests. What he found was that over 90 per cent of the respondents (all of whom actually had served the Chinese couple) said they would not do so. Saenger's (9) interviews with white women in New York City made the same point. Individuals who had been seen buying goods from Negro salesgirls denied that they would do so.
As it happens, we have direct evidence that stated opposition to school desegregation in Southern communities does not necessarily lead to hostile action once desegregation has been initiated.
For example, Bower and Walker (1) in interviews with a cross section of the population of Washing- ton, D.C., in June, 1954, found that 52 per cent of the white respondents thought the Supreme Court decision was bad, only 24 per cent thought it was good, and another 24 per cent was neutral. In other words, among those who had definite opinions, feeling was two to one against the decision—the same proportion as the Virginia vote. Yet desegre- gation took place the following fall. According to Bower and Walker, the first gradual change-over worked so well that the school superintendent de- cided to speed the process a bit and authorized a large-scale transfer: at this point there was a brief strike by junior and senior high school students, which collapsed after a few days when it received little support from the adult community. Except
for this brief strike, desegregation proceeded with- out incident. When the same sample of respondents were reinterviewed toward the end of the school year, even among those who had disapproved of the Supreme Court decision, 39 per cent conceded that desegregation was going "very well" or "fairly well," and only 29 per cent said it was going "not so well" or "badly."
Or take the story of Tucson, Arizona, as reported by Edward and Marianne Dozier in Schools in Transition, a series of community studies edited by Williams and Ryan (12). In the spring of 1950 a bill to make school desegregation compulsory was presented directly to the voters of the state, and was rejected. During this election the Tucson superintendent of schools publicly supported the bill; he received a number of anonymous letters and telephone calls condemning his stand. A year later the state legislature passed a bill permitting de- segregation, but' not requiring it. The Tucson schools were desegregated at the beginning of the next school term—and at this time there was no
public protest from anyone in the community. Other examples of this same sort could be cited.
As for the school strikes—my guess is that, far from being an omen of continuing trouble, they will leave almost no trace. I would predict that if after a few months you looked at interracial associations and attitudes within the schools in towns in which there had been strikes and others which desegre- gated at the same time without any student strikes, you would find few, if any, differences. I base this interpretation not only on the principle I mentioned in connection with the Virginia vote—that expressed opposition is not necessarily a reliable indicator of future behavior—but on a question as to whether strikes really do reflect widespread student opposi- tion to desegregation. Two of the most widely publicized strikes have been in Washington and Baltimore. But in Washington only 2 per cent, and in Baltimore only 3 per cent, of the total student body stayed out of school. Bower, Walker, and Mendelsohn (1, 7) interviewed 100 student strikers in Washington and concluded, briefly, that "nothing specific seemed to have started the strike and stu- dents participated mostly because other students were in it." Although the strikers repeated rumors about attacks by Negroes on white students, when they were asked what made them stay out of school, the most frequent answer did not refer to the ostensible issues but to the influence of their friends and schoolmates. Many were carrying schoolbooks and lunch boxes, and had clearly set out for school
as usual; they were drawn into the strike along the way, and one may speculate that they participated as much for the adventure as for reasons having to do with segregation or desegregation.
What about the expectation that the end of school segregation will lead to sweeping changes in the pattern of race relations in the South—and, specifically, that it will mean the end of all segrega- tion? In expressing some reservations about this I do not mean for one moment to underestimate the importance of the Supreme Court decisions; I share the general judgment that they constitute a major historic event. But I think there is a tendency to overestimate the probable effects of the change in school patterns, both among liberals who hope that desegregation of schools will lead to desegregation in all aspects of life, and among many Southerners who fear that it will. One of the clearest findings of studies of the relation between intergroup contact and attitude change is that, while individuals rather
THE AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGIST
 quickly come to accept and even approve of associa- tion with members of another social group in situa- tions of the type where they have experienced such association, this approval is not likely to be gen- eralized to other situations unless the individuals have quite close personal relationships with mem- bers of the other group. Thus, for example, Hard- ing and Hogrefe (4) found that white salesgirls in Philadelphia department stores who worked in departments where there were Negro salesgirls were more likely than those in all-white departments to express willingness to work with Negroes, but were no more willing to have Negroes as neighbors or as friends. A particularly dramatic example of the extent to which behavior may be limited to a specific situation is Minard's description (8) of a mining community in West Virginia where white and Negro miners work amicably together in mixed teams, sometimes with a Negro supervising white
workers, but separate at the mine shaft and lead their above-ground lives in complete segregation— living in separate neighborhoods, eating in separate restaurants, participating jointly in no activities save those in the union hall. And one need only look around any Northern community to see that unsegregated schools do not necessarily lead to un- segregated living.
lations leads us to question the more obvious com- mon sense interpretations which are usually offered. We look for meanings other than those which ap- pear on the face of things and, by taking a more comprehensive view of the determinants of human action, less often assume direct correspondence be- tween stated opinion and other kinds of behavior. Such an approach suggests alternative and probably more accurate interpretations of specific events. But, to be most useful, psychological science must go beyond explanations of specific phenomena, and provide a schema within which a range of events can be organized and understood. Can social psy- chology provide such a framework for viewing the present scene?
My answer—as you may guess—is "yes" and "no." To elaborate this, I must distinguish be- tween two aspects of the events following on the Supreme Court decision: first, those having to do with the decision of policy makers whether to ac- cept the Court's ruling and desegregate the schools; second, those having to do with what happens once desegregation has been initiated. On questions of the second sort—the process and the effects of de- segregation—we have a considerable body of rele- vant information, and, I think, the beginningsof an organized analytical approach. Within this schema we have a basis for at least tentative predic- tions and for identifying with some certainty the
kinds of situations in which research could provide answers to crucial questions. On the first aspect— that of the process of deciding whether to de- segregate—we have much less to draw upon; I should say we are in a position of having to de- velop simultaneously both a systematic approach
DESEGREGATION: A PSYCHOLOGICAL ANALYSIS
That this kind of compartmentalization occurs
also when schools are newly desegregated is evi-
denced by the descriptions of a number of border
communities, in the Williams and Ryan book (12).
In community after community they report that,
although relations between white and Negro stu-
dents within the schools are matter-of-fact and even
friendly, the two groups go their separate ways out-
side of school. The example is given of a white and ways of testing the hypotheses which grow out
mother, at first reluctant to send her children to a mixed school, who found that her children liked the school and their Negro teachers. She became per- fectly tolerant about the classroom situation, but did not want her children to eat in the school cafeteria or play with Negro students off the school grounds. Time will tell, of course, whether over a period of years school desegregation will gradually extend to desegregation in other areas of living, but there seems no reason to expect an immediate sweeping change.
THE NEED FOR AN ANALYTICAL SCHEMA
These few examples are more than enough to show how our present understanding of social re-
of this approach.
A TTITUDE CHANGES FOLLOWING INTERGROUP CONTACT
Let me start with the area in which I think our knowledge and our thinking are relatively far along. After the last war, a number of psychologists and sociologists interested in attitude change turned their attention to problems of intergroup relations. They developed a consensus that some of the most important determinants of attitude change toward other social groups were to be found in the ex- perience of face-to-face contact with members of those groups. At first, they tended to the optimistic view that such personal contact with members of
 another group was sure to be a powerful influence toward favorable attitude change.
However, in spite of the considerable number of studies which found such a relationship, some did not. A much earlier study by Horowitz (5)—and one of the most interesting in the present context-— had already reported that attitudes toward Negroes of white boys in racially mixed schools in New York City differed little from attitudes of white boys in segregated schools in Tennessee and in Georgia.
Additional research on the relationship between intergroup contact and changes in attitude gave rise to a variation of the old chicken-and-egg ques- tion: A number of studies had found contact with members of an ethnic group other than one's own associated with favorable attitudes toward that ethnic group. But which came first—the contact or the favorable attitude? This methodological dif- ficulty led to an interest in situations of so-called involuntary contact-—on the job, in public housing, in the armed forces, etc.—that is, in situations where the individual is in a setting where there are members of another social group, but he is there not because of a desire to associate with that group but because of a strong push or pull from some other source.
Also, it proved helpful to distinguish between mere physical presence of members of different ethnic groups in a common situation, on the one hand, and the occurrence of interaction between them, on the other. We are now thinking in terms of the following schema: Individuals from two ethnic groups encounter one another involuntarily in some situation. This encounter may or may not lead to interaction, depending on the characteristics of the individuals involved and on the nature of the situation. When it does, the interaction may vary in amount and quality and this variation, in turn, influences the type of attitude change which takes place.
The influence of conditions under which contact occurs. When we raise the question, "What does the nature of the contact situation have to do with the outcome of the experience?", the need to iden- tify the dimensions in terms of which contact situa- tions can be described becomes apparent.
Here are three examples of what I mean. One of the characteristics of a contact situation is the ex- tent to which it offers the opportunity for the par- ticipants to get to know one another—labeled, for
short, its acquaintance potential. There is great variation in the extent to which the characteristics of individuals are revealed during contact. You may encounter an elevator operator, for example, twice a day for years, without communication about anything other than the weather. A contrasting situation—that of living as neighbors—does not im- pose comparable limitations on the areas over which communication may take place and individuality emerge.
A second characteristic of contact situations has to do with the way in which they define the relative status of participants belonging to the two ethnic groups. For example, in a given work situation, Negroes may have only menial jobs while white persons are in skilled or supervisory positions; in another work situation, Negroes and whites may be doing the same kinds of jobs.
My third example of a dimension along which contact situations differ involves the nature of the social norm toward contact of one ethnic group with another. In some situations, the general expecta- tion of persons in authority and of most of the par- ticipants may be that friendly association between members of the two groups is appropriate; in other situations, even though for some reason members of the two groups are present, the general feeling on the part of at least one of the groups may be that any unnecessary mingling should be avoided.
I have time this afternoon to examine the impli- cations of only one of these three concepts for our thinking about the outcomes of desegregation in the public schools of the South—the social norm regarding interaction with the other group. Several studies have pointed to the significance of this variable.
Thus, Minard (8), in the study I have already mentioned of the behavior of white workers in coal mines where they worked with Negroes on an un- segregated basis, and of the same workers in the segregated communities where the mines were lo- cated, estimated that about three-fifths of the men adapted their behavior, without apparent conflict, to the generally accepted practices in the specific situation—even to the extent of sitting next to Negroes in the mine bus but sitting in the white section when they transfer to the public bus.
The perceived norm with regard to contact also has wider effects. In a study of relationships within biracial public housing projects (13), we found that white housewives differed not only in the extent
THE AMERICAN
PSYCHOLOGIST
 of their association with Negroes in the project but in their views as to whether other white women in the project approved of associating with Negroes. We found that those who believed that the other white women in the project approved of such as- sociation showed much more favorable attitudes toward Negroes than did those who believed that the other white women disapproved of such as- sociation. With minor exceptions, this influence of the perceived social norm showed up regardless of whether the women lived in integrated or in build- ing-segregated projects, or of whether they had much or little contact with Negroes: those who be- lieved the other white women in the project ap- proved of interracial association were more favorable in their attitudes toward Negroes than were the comparable white housewives who thought such association was not approved.
The question may, of course, be raised whether perception of the social climate is not itself a func- tion of one's own attitude. The investigators in this study concluded that, while the white house- wife's own attitude might color to some extent her interpretation of the views of other women in the project, on the whole the perceptions of social cli- mate were based on more or less objective evidence.
The cumulative weight of these and other studies highlights the effect of what is generally referred to as the social climate or social atmosphere. What they tell us is that interracial contacts take place in a social context in which the individual is re- sponding not only to persons from another ethnic group but also to what he believes would be judged proper in such relationships by those whose social approval he needs and seeks. This, of course, is a familiar and pervasive characteristic of human be- havior. The fact that it operates generally below the level of conscious awareness and is often ac- companied by the production of beliefs and feelings which rationalize otherwise incomprehensible be- havior gives it a prominent place in the study of social relations.
Nevertheless not enough progress has been made with the task of studying analytically the effect of social climate on the outcomes of intergroup con- tact. Some effort has been made to identify factors contributing to it. It seems possible to distinguish several components: first, positions taken publicly by individuals or groups who carry an aura of moral authority or of extremely high prestige (for example, the Supreme Court, the President of the
United States, church figures); second, the attitudes and behavior of the general population of the com- munity or the region; third, the statements and practices of persons in authority in the particular situation such as the employer or the school super- intendent; and fourth, the behavior, expectations, beliefs, etc., of other members of one's own group with whom one is in direct personal association.
It would be of great interest to know, for in- stance, the relative weight of a position taken by a powerful but distant authority such as the Supreme Court as compared with the norms of the face-to- face group in influencing an individual's reaction to new experiences of interracial contact. And it would be of interest to know what effect a face-to- face group norm that is in conflict with the position taken by the powerful but distant authority has on the interpretation of the latter's action and how this bears on the individual's reaction to novel con- tact experiences. Do Southerners, for instance, more than others, perceive the anti-segregation de- cisions as a political—in the low sense of the term —act rather than as a truly juridical one? And do individuals who so perceive the decisions react dif- ferently to contact experiences than do those who believe the Supreme Court justices were honestly and faithfully attempting to abide by strictly con- stitutional considerations?
In cases where the norm of the immediate group differs from that held by the larger population, we need to know which one is more likely to be fol- lowed. And, since the other members of one's im- mediate group in a situation of intergroup contact are themselves subject to the influences of the con- tact experience, we need to study changes in the face-to-face group norm itself.
The Supreme Court decisions, and the events which have followed them, provide a rare oppor- tunity for studying questions of this sort. We are, in effect, presented with a ready-made laboratory in which, on the one hand, the position of national figures—notably, of course, of the Court itself—has become prominent and is a constant, but where in- dividual communities present a wide range of varia- tion in terms of the position taken by state and city political leaders, local school authorities, and the residents. Studies of border communities in which school desegregation has already taken place, as reported by Williams and Ryan (12), show an enormous range in this respect. In Cairo, Illinois, for instance, desegregation was initiated reluctantly,
DESEGREGATION: A PSYCHOLOGICAL ANALYSIS
 as the result of threats that the state would with- hold financial aid and of legal action by the NAACP; the local school authorities, apparently the entire white population, and much of the Negro popula- tion, appeared to be opposed to desegregation. At the other extreme, Carlsbad, New Mexico, operating under a permissive state law, began to desegregate its schools two years before the Supreme Court de- cision was actually handed down. All important segments of the community seemed to support the move. The superintendent of schools advocated it;
the board of education favored the change on the basis of monetary savings; teachers and principals, on the whole, were not opposed; the Ministerial Al- liance cooperated; community leaders in general took the position that times were changing, and "we might as well go along with it since we can't stop it"; the white high school students voted for integration at the high school level. There are still other communities—such as Hoxie, Arkansas— where the school authorities favor desegregation on economic grounds but general community opinion is strongly opposed.
This wide variation among communities provides a striking opportunity—one which it is probably not possible to create under laboratory conditions, and which is not likely to be again duplicated on such a scale in our lifetime—for studying the effects on social change of differences in social norms, and the relative influence of different sources of norms.
Were we able to utilize this real-life laboratory, I would find of especial interest the community which desegregates its schools while all the sources of social climate save those at the national level oppose the step and, where possible, act to limit its effect. It is in such communities that I suspect we may see the really dramatic developments. Under the influence of the social norms which pre- vail at the outset, the schoolroom contact may seem for some time to be without effect. Then at some later period—and I could not guess how much later —there will be a time during which change in the relationships between white and Negro students proceeds at what will seem an unexpectedly rapid pace. Behind this, if I am right, will lurk un- recognized the influence of a changed social norm among the students themselves. It seems to be often the case that the basis for a shift in norms develops well in advance of the shift itself. When, for some reason, the new norm crystallizes in the
perceptions of members of a group they may show very suddenly behavior for which in fact they had been individually ready for some time. A factor which may help encourage such a development in school desegregation is the general readiness of adolescents to rebel against adult authority.
The influence of characteristics oj individuals who are in contact. So much for this illustration of the need to think in terms of characteristics of the con- tact situation when analyzing the outcomes of in- voluntary presence in intergroup contact situations. Let me mention more briefly another class of varia- bles which seem important: namely, characteristics of the individuals who are in contact. They are of interest from two quite different points of view. First, each group constitutes part of the contact situation for the other group. Characteristics which are relevant from this point of view may be thought of as "characteristics of the individual as object" or "characteristics of the object-group." Second, each group may be looked at as potential changers as a result of the contact. Characteristics which are relevant from this point of view I shall refer to as "characteristics of the individual as subject" or "characteristics of the subject-group."
To the extent that learning about the other group takes place in intergroup contact, it follows that the characteristics of the individuals with whom contact takes place may have an effect on the out- come. With specific reference to the interethnic character of the contact, two aspects of the char- acteristics of object individuals seem likely to be of particular importance: the extent to which the in- dividuals differ from the commonly held stereotypes about the object group; and the extent to which they resemble the subject individuals in terms of background characteristics, interests, etc.
It seems likely that the great variety of patterns which are appearing in the course of the shift to desegregated schools may give rise to situations which differ in this respect. For example, Valien's report on the process of desegregation in Cairo, Illinois (12), notes that, because of a variety of community pressures, middle- and upper-class Negro children remained in segregated schools, and only children of the lowest socioeconomic group en- rolled in the formerly white schools. Many of these children were below average in intellectual ability, had had poor records in the Negro schools, and did not do well in their new schools; according
THE AMERICANPSYCHOLOGIST
 to the report, they tended, because of this selective process, to confirm the white stereotypes that Negroes are stupid and lazy. On the other hand, there will certainly be other communities where the children of the better-educated Negro families will enter mixed schools. While it will admittedly be difficult to identify in advance situations where the Negro children in a mixed school will tend to con- form to the derogatory stereotypes and others where they will not, examination of the characteristics of residential neighborhoods should make it possible to identify schools where each of these situations is likely to occur. Comparisons of attitudes and behavior of white children in the two types of schools should throw considerable light on the im- portance of characteristics of the object individuals in determining attitudes.
When we consider the individuals in the contact situation as subjects, we regard them from a some- what different point of view. Focusing now upon the attitude changes they may undergo, we would like to know why some change more and others less; some in one direction, others in another. Two classes of personal variables may be thought of as likely to influence the individual's reaction to inter- group contact: the nature and intensity of initial attitudes toward the object group, and aspects of personality or character structure which may pre- dispose one to hostile reactions toward members of outgroups.
The few studies which have attempted to take account of initial attitudes have emerged with a striking diversity of conclusions. Two studies in public housing projects (3, 13) found that white housewives who said they were initially unfavorable to Negroes were more likely to report favorable attitude changes than were those who reported themselves as being originally favorable. Another study (11), of white residents of a block into which Negroes had moved, reported exactly the opposite finding: those who were relatively favorable toward Negroes at the time the first Negro family was about to move in became more favorable after the Negroes had been living there a few weeks; those who were initially unfavorable had become still more unfavorable.
All of these studies took into account simply dif- ferences in the degree of favorableness or unfavor- ableness of the attitudes rather than the particular constellation of beliefs and feelings. It may be,
however, that there are other differences in at- titudes which make them more or less resistant to change. It has sometimes been stated, for example, that there are at least two distinct constellations of attitudes in the South. According to one, Negroes are gentle, fun-loving, jolly, but childlike and ir- responsible; this attitude is said to have a warm, affectionate component; one is fond of Negroes, but just doesn't consider them intellectually and socially the same class of human being as oneself. The second, apparently quite different, attitude constellation is dominated by apprehension of the Negro as potentially dangerous, animal-like, and sexually uncontrolled. It is likely, of course, that the two constellations may often exist simultane- ously in the same individual.
If these observations of differences in kinds of at- titude are correct, it is reasonable to ask whether they differ in the extent to which they can be changed by experience with Negroes. For example, if there is really an attitude which is made up of friendly feelings in combination with unrealistic be- liefs about Negroes and a caste feeling that they are a different order of being (and from my personal experience, I believe there is), is it possible that experience with Negroes in a situation where at least officially they are defined as equals might correct the beliefs and gradually eradicate the caste feelings, without destroying the friendliness? Or would the disappearance of the caste distinction re- sult in a threat to self-esteem which would generate hostility? To my knowledge, there are no studies on attitude constellations of this sort, and the out- come should be quite instructive.
The research potential in school desegregation.
Many of these questions can be studied as well in situations of involuntary contact in the North as in desegregated schools in the South. Why then do I emphasize the importance of research in Southern schools? Partly, it is because of the scale on which desegregation is taking place in the South. It is estimated that more than 150,000 Negro children who formerly attended segregated schools are now in mixed classes for the first time. Since in most of the newly mixed schools Negro children are in the minority, it seems safe to estimate that about half a million white children are for the first time hav- ing contact with Negroes in school.
From the point of view of research, the sig- nificance of change on such a scale is the probability

that contact between Negro and white children will occur under a great variety of conditions and that this would make it possible to find contrasts which highlight the variable one is interested in studying. Moreover, the fact that the change is occurring in so many schools and so many communities means that similar combinations of variables will be re- peated, thus making it possible to replicate studies and so check the findings.
The situation also presents a second advantage. Because of the gradualness of the increase in the number of situations of involuntary contact in the North, it is difficult to find comparable or contrast- ing situations in which interracial contact is about to occur for the first time. Almost all studies have been carried out in situations where whites and Negroes were already in contact at the time of the investigation; initial attitudes had to be recalled by the respondents or inferred by the investigators on the basis of indirect evidence. In contrast, the fact that thousands of children in hundreds of southern communities will be attending mixed schools for the first time offers an unprecedented opportunity for research which can get direct evi- dence of initial attitude and in which the process of attitude change can be traced rather than in- ferred.
There is still another advantage—namely, the possibility of checking findings which seem fairly well substantiated in Northern studies, in settings where the over-all milieu is quite different. For example, it seems quite well established that, under certain combinations of circumstances—such as those obtaining in interracial public housing projects in the North—actual physical proximity of residence of whites to Negroes is an important determinant of favorableness of attitudes toward them. Would this finding hold in the quite different setting of a mixed school in a Southern town: will the white children who happen to be seated close to Negro children associate with them more, and become more friendly with them, than those who are seated farther away? Here I predict rather confidently that the answer will be yes.
PUBLIC POSITION-TAKING ON CONSEQUENTIAL ISSUES
You will recall that I said earlier that we could think of the events following the Supreme Court's decision partly in terms of the process of desegrega-
tion as I have been discussing it and partly in terms of decisions to desegregate or not to desegregate the schools in a given locality. Let me turn now to this latter aspect.
First we should note that we are involved here in an area of decision-making which is in many respects quite different from those that have been studied by social psychologists up to now. Most of the available studies have dealt with the effect of the conditions under which decisions are made on the subsequent behaviors of the people who decide. Considerable interest has focused on the process of decision-making in situations where the decisions do not have wider reverberations than the small groups in which they are made. Another focus has been upon decisions where the final act is completely private, as in voting behavior. In the present con- text, by contrast, we are concerned with the act of arriving at a public decision on consequential issues which inevitably involve large-scale public interest.
In relation to desegregation, it is developments in connection with these public decisions which make the headlines, although in my own opinion the real drama is played out in the schools and PTA's once desegregation gets under way. The daily papers bring us reports of reactions which run the gamut from decisions to desegregate immediately to state- ments that desegregation will never be accepted. For example, within twelve months after the Su- preme Court's first ruling—that is, even before the Court had issued any directives as to how and when desegregation was to be initiated—scattered com- munities in eight states, plus the District of Co- lumbia, had undertaken to desegregate their schools. On the other hand, seven states—Virginia, North and South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana—after the Court's second ruling, have passed legislation designed to preserve segregation. The Governor of Maryland announced immediately that his state was prepared to accept the Court's decision as the law of the land; by contrast, the Governor-elect of Mississippi has proposed legisla- tion which would make the advocacy of desegrega- tion a criminal offense and disbar any lawyer han- dling a desegregation case. Within Virginia, where the citizens were voting two to one against integra- tion in the public schools, the Catholic schools have already desegregated. Within Georgia, while the Governor was proclaiming that no white child in his state would ever have to attend school with a
 Negro child, the Mayor of Atlanta was announcing that the city would abide by a Court ruling that golf courses must be open to all. While "white citizens' councils" to "defend states' rights and pre- serve racial purity" were being formed, such groups as the Southern Methodist Conference were pass- ing resolutions favoring desegregation.
What are we to make of this bewildering variety of reactions? Do we have in psychology an ap- proach to such events which would help us to see some order underlying the apparent confusion?
Before I try to suggest the direction which such an approach might take, let me outline tentatively some trends which I think can be observed in re- cent events in the South. It appears that, other things being equal, desegregation tends to proceed faster in cities than in rural areas, in border regions than in the deep South, in areas where the propor- tion of Negroes is small, and in areas where there has been a sizable influx of people from outside the South. Persons opposing desegregation seem to be older and less well-educated. Persons who support desegregation do so primarily on the basis of moral and religious allegiance, on the one hand, and on law-abiding grounds on the other. Desegregation seems to be accepted relatively easily within or- ganizations, such as the Army and the Catholic Church, which have strong and enforceable sanc- tions. Segregation is abandoned more easily when it conflicts with some other need than where there is no such opposing force; for example, a white person who, in a relatively empty train, will not sit next to a Negro may do so when the only vacant seat happens to be next to a Negro. And indi- viduals' views about segregation or integration tend to be brought into line with the position of im- portant reference groups.
While these trends, if they are correctly ob- served, suggest some orderlinessin the apparent con- fusion of events, they do not in themselves give us a basis for a psychological organization of our thinking in relation to an individual instance of de- cision making—such as, for example, might be represented by the vote of a member of the School Board of Knox County, Tennessee, on a proposal to desegregate the public schools of the county.
I think that most, if not all, of the complex phenomena that have been observed can be com- prehended within the framework of two groups of concepts: one having to do with variables which
may be related to the direction the decision takes, the other dealing with factors influencing the extent to which any given one of these possible variables becomes a weighty determinant of the position taken.
Some developments in the town of Hoxie, Ar- kansas, will illustrate what I mean. At the time of the Supreme Court's decision, the Hoxie School Board was in debt and discouraged about the pos- sibility of improving the financial situation. One of the heavier drains on the school district's budget was the cost of transporting a number of Negro students of high school age to a Negro high school in a nearby community and paying that community for their tuition. The Hoxie School Board inter- preted the first Supreme Court decision as in- validating the Arkansas law requiring racial segrega- tion. They saw the possibility of solving their financial crisis by enrolling the Negro high school students in their own high school, and decided to do this. To the outside observer this decision might well appear to be based upon a favorable reaction to racially mixed public schools, and it was widely interpreted in this way. Actually, it probably had no such implication whatsoever. Although the Board's public statement of reasons included refer- ence to religious and constitutional values, I under- stand from observers on the scene that the major factor in their decision was the financial one, that they took the step with great reluctance, and that their personal attitudes, like those of most of the other white residents of the community, favored separation of the races.
This example points to two variables which are potential determinants of the desegregation deci- sion: one, individual attitudes toward Negroes and toward segregation; the other, the incentive repre- sented by financial benefits to be gained by de- segregating. The school board made its decision in terms of the latter consideration; the community reacted in terms of its attitude toward segregation. What made the financial consideration the deter- mining one for the school board, who were in other respects not different from other members of the community? It seems clear that what is reflected here is the influence of role requirements. As mem- bers of the board of education, they were responsible for the school budget; it was this role requirement which made the economy of integrated schools the dominant consideration for them.

Some determinants of the direction of position- taking. A parallel to what we have found in Hoxie will be found in other situations. Some of the potential determinants of the decision, such as racial attitudes, are of the sort which recur regard- less of the specific situation, that is, they have an inherent psychological relation to the desegregation issue. Others, like the financial incentive, are not so related but are made relevant through the op- eration of some other factor.
Let me mention first some of the first type of variables—those which are inherently relevant to the desegregation decision. I have already referred, in the Hoxie example, to the variables of attitudes toward Negroes and toward racial separation. These attitudes involve both apprehensions and values directly relevant to the segregation issue. You will remember that one of the trends I thought I had noted is that less well-educated persons are likely to be more opposed to desegregation. A possible inference from this might be that underlying one s decision to support or oppose desegregation is a need for social status. For the less well-educated, being white and therefore upper caste, may be the only way in which this need is satisfied. If this is true, apprehension of a possible loss of status if Negro children attend schools on a basis of equality with white children might be expected to run higher for this segment of the population. Another ap- prehension relating directly to the possible effects of desegregation may be the fear of loss of political and economic power, particularly where Negroes are in the majority.
On the values side, the one most directly related to beliefs about the desirability of desegregation would seem to be the political or philosophical creed of the basic equality of individuals. In considering this value as a factor entering into the decision whether or not to desegregate, one would need to know not only its strength for a given individual but the extent to which it is compartmentalized and out of contact with segregation practices.
Factors influencing the relevance and strength of various determinants. I shall not attempt to list the variables which are not inherently related to the question of desegregation but which may be- come relevant through the operation of other factors; potentially they cover the whole range of human motivation. Rather, I should like to consider some of the major factors which can operate, first, to
bring these otherwise irrelevant variables into con- nection with the desegregation issue and second, to influence the strength of any given variable—• whether or not it is inherently related to desegrega- tion—in the decision.
One of these factors has been illustrated in the Hoxie example—that of the requirements of the role which the individual occupies. In that instance, the role requirements brought into prominence the financial incentive to desegregation. In other in- stances, role requirements may make community opinion the decisive variable. A local political leader, for example, is likely to be especially sensi- tive to community attitudes, since his continued occupation of his position is dependent on com-
munity approval.
Another factor which may bring seemingly un-
related variables into the segregation decision and which may also influence the relative strength of variables is the position taken by reference groups which are important to the individual. Let us say, for example, that an individual places great stress on respect for law. Before the Court's decision, this value exerted no force toward desegregation; in fact, in the South, the value of law-abidingness would operate in support of segregation. But the Court's ruling may bring the value of law-abiding- ness into play as a force toward desegregation, re- gardless of the individual's attitudes toward racial mingling. Thus, statements by officials in the border states have frequently had the following tone, "However we as individuals feel about de- segregation, as loyal citizens we will of course re- spect the authority of the nation's highest judicial body."
One can see a similar process with respect to face-to-face reference groups. Consider, for ex- ample, the fact that soon after the Court's decision school boards in a number of communities set up plans for studying means of desegregating, with every indication that they were inclined toward a decision to desegregate. As time went on there was a shift. In some cases little more was heard of the plan; in others the plan was explicitly postponed or abandoned. Or take such communities as Mil- ford, Delaware, where the decision to desegregate was officially made, but reconsidered as a result of strong community protests. In such situations, one may suppose that there was to begin with only one effective reference group—namely, the Supreme
 Court. But as community opinion was mobilized, a new force entered into the situation—the posi- tion taken by a reference group which was closer not only physically but probably also psychologi- cally. This force brought into the complex of variables influencing the desegregation decision the desire for approval by persons who are important to the individual. This desire for social approval can be assumed to have existed in the board members all along, but it did not become an important varia- ble in the desegregation decision until the expres- sion of community opinion made it clear that a decision for desegregation would lead to disapproval.
A third factor which may connect otherwise ir- relevant variables with the desegregation decision is that of the ability of individuals or groups which have some authority over the individual to invoke sanctions which have objective consequences for him. Even if a group is not a reference group for a given individual, it may objectively have power over him which it can exert in order to bring him into line with its position. Thus, for a school board member who faces the possibility of prosecution for contempt of court, the desire to avoid the un- pleasantness of legal proceedings and a possible fine becomes relevant to the question of whether the community's schools are to be desegregated, and may outweigh his own attitudes and beliefs about segregation. The possibility of such sanctions is not limited to persons whose roles carry responsi- bility for the decision. For the man who faces loss of his job if he signs a petition urging desegrega- tion, or the lawyer threatened with disbarment if he represents a plaintiff in a desegregation suit, the need to earn a living becomes linked with his posi- tion on the desegregation issue. The weight which the variable thus invoked has in the decision is likely to bear a direct relation to the seriousness of the objective consequences for the individual's life. It is important to note that not everybody is equally vulnerable to such sanctions. Some individuals may be relatively immune, perhaps because of sup- port from a subgroup, or because of some unique aspects of their position, such as having an inde- pendent income.
I want to mention one last factor which may in- fluence the weight of a given variable in the deci- sion; this is an over-all change in the average strength of the variable wherever its influence is felt. We sometimes think of variables in the sense
that they have different strengths for different in- dividuals at a given time, but many of the variables which are likely to enter into the desegregation decision are of interest also in the sense that their average strength may be expected to change over time.
To illustrate, a variable whose strength through- out the country is likely to change over the next few years is the financial cost of continued segrega- tion—or, conversely, the financial rewards of de- segregation. The South, together with the rest of the country, will experience an intensification of the already serious problem of overcrowded schools. Where the need for additional school buildings is already an emergency, it will soon assume the na- ture of a crisis. As you know, the Federal govern- ment is about to embark upon a major program of financial aid to states for school construction. I believe it is unlikely that Federal aid will be given to states which are openly defying the Supreme Court, and it seems impossible that such aid could go to those which have shifted from public to private schools. This will mean that continued school segregation will cost more and more for in- creasingly less adequate schooling for white chil- dren. It is not impossible to imagine that this de- velopment, in itself, may become a basis for school desegregation, overriding beliefs and fears about the dangers of racial integration.
Another variable whose strength may be expected to change has to do with one aspect of the social norm toward desegregation. Recently a Columbia, South Carolina, newspaper complained in an edi- torial of the fact that some of the previously segre- gated states had gone ahead with plans for de- segregation. The writer indicated that this would make it harder for other states to hold out for segregation. As I have mentioned, desegregation is already under way in 8 of the 17 states which were segregated prior to the Court's decision. It is not unlikely that it will get under way in several addi- tional states in the not too distant future. As this happens, the social norms regarding segregation to which the decision-makers of the remaining states respond will become increasingly heterogeneous— some favoring and some opposing a change. One can guess that the effect of this will be to greatly weaken the social support for opposing the Court's decision, which is now one of the major factors at work in the still segregated states.

 12 THE AMERICAN
PSYCHOLOGIST
The last considerations I shall mention in rela- tion to the desegregation decision—and on occasion they may be the most important—are those we traditionally encompass under the heading of per- sonality. Perhaps this is only a crude way of say- ing that when we have taken into account all of the factors that I have discussed up to now, there will remain striking variations in individual behavior still unaccounted for. When, for example, you con- sider the actions of a man like Governor Folsom of Alabama, situational determinants of behavior seem suddenly insignificant. Imagine a man—a poli- tician we might say under other circumstances—- situated in the very heart of the deep South, re- fusing to sign the legislature's pro-segregation bills and warning the Alabama Education Association against "the excessive noise being made by those who are guided by blind prejudice and bigotry" (10, Sept. 1955). Some such quality as that which Riesman has called inner-directedness—the extent of one's independence from social approval—must be invoked to make sense of the decisions of such
a person.
Let me make it clear, finally, that in identifying
these various determinants of desegregation de- cisions and suggesting some ways in which they may operate, I am not implying that such con- siderations put us in a position to predict and anticipate the decisions about desegregation which are yet to be made. The most I would claim for them is that they organize the available experience sufficiently to tell us where to look for some of the more crucial determinants of such decisions.
WILL THE NEEDED RESEARCH BE DONE?
I should like to be able to conclude my comments with the statement that the type of research I have been describing was being done or might soon get under way. Social scientists are agreed on the un- paralleled opportunity which the situation presents. It seems inconceivable in the face of this that we should not make a major effort to utilize the op- portunity. But as yet, with minor exceptions, we have available only a collection of case histories of school systems where desegregation has been initi- ated. Without detracting from their obvious value, it is clear that they can not give us the evidence in the form we need it if our understandingof social change is to be advanced. Nevertheless, with the
exception of research on some aspects of desegrega- tion in Washington carried out by Bower of Ameri- can University and Walker of Howard University, and a few small-scale and isolated investigations supported by funds from the Society for the Psy- chological Study of Social Issues (2, 7), I knowof no systematic work in progress or in prospect. And, worse yet, I am afraid the die has been cast and that little or no research is to be done.
Wherein lies the trouble? In view of the interest among social scientists, why do they not go ahead? The answer is that field research of the sort re- quired necessitates funds for research expenses and these are not available. Government agencies which sponsor research have felt they could not incur the enmity of congressmen who might reduce support for their research as a whole. But what about foundations? To my knowledge, the major founda- tions having interests in this area have all been asked for assistance and the answer has been uni- formly negative. Why this is so I, of course, do not know. I trust it may be only a coincidence that the recent congressional investigations of founda- tions were chaired by a southern congressman quite opposed to social change. If it is not, it is quite understandable, although regrettable, that such in- vestigations should have led to a more cautious ap- praisal of the wisdom of supporting research on controversial subjects.
It is a small consolation, but comforting, never- theless, to feel that we understand the events of this dramatic period in Americanhistory well enough to be able to conceive a fruitful research attack upon their meaning for social relations in general. That this attack is not to be prosecuted is a scien- tific tragedy of the first order. Being possessed of a great faith in the determination and ingenuity of my scientific colleagues, I can only hope that the tragedy may yet be averted.

Your Biography
You were born in London, England in 1911.  In 1933, you graduated from Columbia University's school of medicine with a degree in Psychiatry. After serving in the Navy during WWII, you moved to Los Angeles where you developed a successful psychiatric practice.  Over time, your practice became something of a 'favorite' of the hollywood elite. As a result, you became particularly famous both in the psychiatric community as well as popular culture.  In many ways, you are the most famous psychoanalyst practicing today.
While you are a Freudian, you have always worried about the scientific rigor of the tradition. You generally advocate for psychiatric practice based on scientific principles rather than theoretical grounding – and this is no more important than in the context of homosexuality.
Your practice as 'psychiatrist to the stars' meant that you were constantly approached by young men, some of whom were extremely famous, who sought to change their orientation from gay to straight.  You treated them according to the orthodox practice of uncovering the patient's repressed feelings of rejection caused by his cold and distant father and/or his misidentification with gender roles because of an overbearing mother. But these treatments just didn't work.  In your own writings on this subject, you described your experiences thusly: “The gay men I saw were caught up, for the most part, in the common myth that it was bad to be gay and that if they possibly could, they ought to try to be heterosexual. I was sympathetic to their wishes to try to become straight if they could...  We used to think in those days that psychoanalysis could cure everything, from chilblains to homosexuality.  But I wasn't too successful. Some were able to function bisexually but most of them remained gay.” (quoted in Kutchins &amp; Kirk, 1997, p. 63).
In 1956, Evelyn Hooker published her study of the mental health of gay men in San Francisco.  This changed everything. In retrospect, you have said “The first time I heard Dr. Evelyn Hooker state that homosexuality was not an illness, I wasn't prepared to go all the way. This was in 1956 when she presented her study of gay men. I was sympathetic to what she was saying but I wasn't totally convinced. I still had a feeling that it was a developmental deviation.”
Those 'feelings' dissipated during the 1960's, when you became increasingly frustrated with your attempts to change the behavior of the many homosexuals who have sought your skills as a psychoanalyst.  You ultimately concluded that homosexuality is not directly harmful to the mental health of the patients, but the psychic conflict caused by the patients' beliefs that homosexuality is a mental illness and their homosexual orientation is. Homosexuality is, in your view, just a normal variant of human sexuality, not a pathology.
This conviction has lead you into direct conflict with many of your Freudian peers, who continue to believe that homosexuality is a pathology.  You suspect that this belief persists in the psychiatric community because of a simple scientific error: the psychiatric community only sees an unrepresentative sample of homosexuals. By and large, psychiatrists are only exposed to homosexuals who seek treatment for their orientation. And that population is exactly the individuals who experience internal conflict between their homosexuality and their belief that it is a mental illness. If psychiatrists were to interact with 'normal' happy, healthy homosexuals outside the clinical setting, they would come to understand that the homosexuality itself is not a mental illness.
Freud mentions homosexuality a number of places in Introductory Lectures on Psychoanalysis, and it is crucially important that you study these carefully.  Freud believes that sexual life of children, which is regarded at the time as 'normal' includes a number of activities that would later in life be viewed as 'perverse', including same-sex contact.  In Freud's theory, heterosexuality develops with puberty in normal people. In 'inverts' or homosexuals, something goes wrong in this development. The object of ones' 'natural' desire--the genitels of the opposite sex—becomes transformed into parts of the body that represent those parts in the same sex.  Thus, homosexuality is no different in psychological mechanism than a foot fetish or any other neurotic 'perversion' (see p. 376-384 of Introductory Lectures) Homosexuality is not a psychologically isolated condition. According to Freud:
“We are compelled, however, to regard the choice of an object of one's own sex as a divergence in erotic life which is of positively habitual occurrence, and we are learning more and more to ascribe an especially high importance to it.” (p. 381)
In short, homosexuality is a kind of neurosis, yet it is not, itself, particularly worrying. The action itself is merely 'habitual,' and hence can be cured through standard habit-blocking therapy (Freud suggests that paranoia stops homosexuality on p. 381 of the Introductory Lectures).  It is, however, invariably an indicator of deeper psychological problems, as the transference and substitution of the 'natural' object of sexual desire to a different object will cause neurosis. See Ch 26 of the Introductory Lectures, especially p. 530, for Freud's explanation of homosexuality as neurotic narcissism.
The current advocates of this view are Charles Socarides and Irving Bieber.  They will be your main opponents in this game. Complicating matters somewhat, you were actually classmates with Irving Bieber at Columbia.  You were friends then, and that personal relationship may be at stake in this debate.
You are also an outspoken advocate for civil and human rights of all sort, having written papers in support of the Civil Rights movement, against McCarthyism and in opposition to the Vietnam war.
You are currently Director of Psychiatry at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center and Professor of Psychiatry at the University of Southern California.
Game Objectives
You are a member of the secret faction 'The Young Turks' with John Spiegel. This is a group of politically progressive psychiatrists founded in 1970, after the events in San Francisco, dedicated to changing the direction psychiatry for the future. You have a connection to the 'Group for the Advancement of Psychiatry,' which has been advocating for progressive causes—specifically, limiting the use of electroshock therapy, ending the persecution of homosexuals by the US Military, desegregating the American south, etc—in psychiatry since the end of WWII.  
As a first step, the young turks (specifically you) will propose to the Board of Directors that homosexuality be removed from the next edition of the DSM during the 1971 conference.  Your colleagues in psychoanalysis are not necessarily your friends here. In fact, your Freudian colleagues Bieber and Socarides are your opponents.  On this issue, your friends are largely hidden. You will need to figure out who supports such a motion, and who does not.
During this process, you will need to work closely with the chair of the nomenclature committee Robert Spitzer.  He is convinced that homosexuality is a mental illness, but thinks that the main advocates of that position, Socarides and Bieber, are pushing a social / political agenda, not doing scientific work. You will have to convince him that psychic distress in homosexuals seeking treatment results from the mistaken belief that there is something wrong with being homosexual.  Curing that distress is not about curing homosexuality, it is about curing the individual's social/cultural prejudices.
In 1970, Socarides published a paper in the Journal of the American Medical Association titled “Homosexuality and Medicine” (212 (7): 1199). Introduce a resolution in 1971 during ‘new business’ condemning the article as unscientific and calling for its retraction. Your proposal should call Socarides' theory a “monstrous attack on homosexuality.”
Once homosexuality is removed from the taxonomy of mental illnesses, get elected president. If you cannot do that, get appointed to the Spitzer Task Force. In either of these roles, you should advocate for the president to appoint a special director or task force to lead the effort of removing the stigma of 'mental illness' from homosexuality.
It is likely that Socarides and Bieber will move to abdicate the vote of the nomenclature committee. If you are president in 1974, propose a referendum of the membership on the issue of the declassification  of homosexuality. If you are not, work with Spitzer and the President to move the issue to a referendum.
During the restructuring of the DSM-III, you should be chiefly concerned with protecting the psychoanalytic tradition.  While you think that homosexuality is not a mental illness, you are not willing to give up the 'dynamic hypothesis': the Psychoanalytic commitment to the etiology of mental illness in terms of inter-psychical conflict.
When, and if, the game reaches a point of trying to define mental illness, you must pass a psychoanalytic interpretation of mental disorder / illness. If a definition contains reference to a 'natural function' or another similar assumption, you should fight that proposal.
Specific assignments
During the first APA conference, you are to present your paper  “Limitations of Free Association” to the population.  The paper is available in Arch. Gen. Psychiat. 22:160-165, 1970.
As an initial member of the Research committee, you'll be called upon to judge the scientific legitimacy and ethical acceptability of proposed research programs.  You should make yourself familiar with the sections of the game book titled 'A Primer on Research Methods' and 'Ethics of Human Research'.  Your gamemaster will give you an additional sheet outlining the responsibilities of members of the research committee in evaluating proposals.
In 1971, propose that 'homosexuality' be removed from 302.00 of DSM-II.  In making this proposal, you should make sure you read out the actual language of 302.
In 1972, after Bieber's report comes in, you should propose a condemnation of Socarides' 1970 JAMA paper as a 'monstrous attack on homosexuality'. It is very, very rare for the APA to issue a public condemnation, so you will have to do your homework and be seriously prepared.
R. Green and J. Spiegel will be heading up a taskforce to report on the history of the homosexuality in psychology and psychiatry in 1972. He will invite responses to the report. You should be one of those responses. Bieber and/or Socarides will probably be the other one, so be prepared for a face-to-face debate in public on their view.
Fission: While you support the founding of the ApsaA, you are not willing to abandon the APA.

            <Text>###### The paradigm in experimental psychology: Hermann Ebbinghaus

As you may recall from  &lt;!--\ref{birthofpsychology:germanphysiologicalpsychologyinthe1880s1890s}--&gt;, in the 1860s and 1870s a handful of researchers in German started applying the experimental method to sensation and perception. Fechner’s law was one of the first great successes of this era, as for the first time, it related a physical phenomenon to a psychological one with the precision of mathematics. 

Today, Ebbinghaus is frequently characterized as the ‘founder’ of experimental psychology---as he site ‘encyclopedia.com’ does---and his experiments frequently taught in intro to research methods courses.  This makes his work a ‘paradigm’ for contemporary psychology. In order to understand what counts as ‘good science’ in this environment, we must understand Ebbinghaus.

The first step in scientific endeavor into a new domain, according to Ebbinghaus, is to 

&gt; The method of obtaining exact measurements i.e., numerically exact ones of the inner structure of causal relations is, by virtue of its nature, of general validity. This method, indeed, has been so exclusively used and so fully worked out by the natural sciences that, as a rule, it is defined as something peculiar to them, as the method of natural science. [p. 7][#Ebbinghaus:1885ud]

Following Fechner, the primary goal of scientific investigation---prehaps *the* defining feature of science itself---is the creation of mathematically precise descriptions of natural phenomena. 

When Ebbinghaus first approached the question of memory, he needed to create an environment, like Newton’s darkened room, where comparisons between different tasks could be compared. 

The first step is to control “the mass of conditions which have proven themselves causally connected with a certain result”, then, one of those is systematically varied, and the resulting effect measured.

&lt;!--\newthought{Ebbinghaus set out to systematically measure memory}--&gt;---so he created a protocol for testing his own memory. In order to control his own personal associations with words, which might make them more memorable, he created a list of 2,300 1-syllable nonsense words. These were drawn randomly for each experiment. He then memorized lists and he measured how many he could remember after a given time period---he didn’t do this by introspection, but forced himself to actually write down all that he could recall, and check to see how accurate he was. He formalized the process of memorization, going so far as to use a clockwork mechanism to ensure that he spent the exact same amount of time memorizing each list.

There were things he could not control, of course. He recognized that his own accent and ‘mother-tongue’ might influence the test, the ‘conditions of his daily life’ might have an impact---he recognizes that his mind is typically fresher in the morning than the evening, for example. The experiments took months to complete, and there could be seasonal effects.  

He then varied the length of the lists and compared it against the time it takes to memorize. And he did this repeatedly, recording 518 lists over two periods, 1789-1790 and 1883-1884.
&lt;!--\begin{figure*}\includegraphics{../images/ebbinghaus1885.png}\caption{Ebbinghaus’ first table of results in his \emph{Memory}, 1885}\label{fig:ebbinghaus1}\end{figure*}--&gt;

He also counted, using a string of beads, the number of repetitions it took to memorize a list. This produced, after many variations and trials, the chart to the right, not called ‘The learning curve’.
&lt;!--\begin{marginfigure}
 \begin{center}

     \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{../images/ebbinghausFig6.png}
\end{center}
 \caption{Screenshot of “Fig 6” from p. 48, Ebbinghaus 1885. Now called ‘the learning curve.’}
\label{fig: ebbinghaus6}
\end{marginfigure}
--&gt;

&lt;!--\newthought{Ebbinghaus then turned his attention to recall and retention.}--&gt; Working from the commonsense notion that the longer you study, the longer it is retained, Ebbinghaus designed a protocol whereby he would measure the number of repetitions it would aka not re-learn a list after a given amount of time.  Perfect recall would ’cost’ no further repetitions or time.  Total failure would (presumably) require the same amount of time as it took in the first place.

As before, this protocol is designed to create a numeric representation (number of repetitions)  of a psychological idea (ability to recall). As one might expect, the higher the number of repetitions on learning, the fewer needed after 24 hours to recall the list perfectly.

Measuring in seconds, Ebbinghaus determined the amount of time ‘saved’ when re-learning by repeating the learning in the first place---and the average number of seconds saved by each additional repetition. His results are remarkable:
&lt;!--\begin{marginfigure}
 \begin{center}

     \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{../images/ebbinghaus2.png}
\end{center}
 \caption{Screenshot recall table, p. 56 Ebbinghaus 1885.}
\label{fig: ebbinghaus2}
\end{marginfigure}
--&gt;

&lt;!--\newthought{His last great contribution to psychology is the ‘forgetting curve’.}--&gt;  Using the measurements developed in previous experiments, Ebbinghaus started measuring the number of repetitions needed to restore a list versus the amount of time since the list was memorized. He found that after just and hour, 1/2 of the original work was required to refresh the list.  But after 8 hours, it was only 2/3rds, not the whole amount. He also discovered that individual items in the list are retained differently according to their serial position.  He summarized his findings as:

&gt; The strength of the connection, and therefore the amount of work which is eventually saved, is a decreasing function of the time or of the number of intervening members which separated the syllables in question from one another in the original series. It is a maximum for immediately successive members.  The precise character of the function is unknown except that it decreases at first quickly and then gradually very slowly with the increasing distance  of the terms. [p. 107][#Ebbinghaus:1885ud]

While the list of psychological principles attributed to Ebbinghaus is long, it is absolutely true that he noted what is now called the “magic number 7”--that the longest list of random syllables one can remember without practice is 7. [p. 47][#Ebbinghaus:1885ud]
	
It’s also true that all of these experiments were preformed on an experimental group of one individual: himself.  There was no control group and no random sampling of a population. But it is also noteworthy that he recognized these limitations in his study: 

&gt; The tests were all made upon myself and have primarily only individual significance. Naturally they will not reflect exclusively mere idiosyncrasies of my mental organisation; if the absolute values found are throughout only individual, yet many a relation of general validity will be found in the relation of these numbers to each other or in the relations of the relations. [Author’s preface, p. v][#Ebbinghaus:1885ud]

Ebbinghaus’ paradigm is not having a control group, blinding reviewers, or randomizing across a population. Rather, I suspect, Ebbinghaus’ paradigm comes down to two things:

1. Ebbinghaus’ goal throughout these studies was to describe psychological phenomena in the precise language of mathematics. While *Memory* does contain a few formulae, the whole of the book is consumed with the validity of his measurements of the time it takes to memorize and the costs of forgetting.

2. Ebbinghaus set a standard for transparency of data and thoroughness in controlling potential confounding variables. He addresses every potential confound as it arrises and redesigns his protocol to control, or measure that confound. And those he cannot, he labels and presents to the reader.  The passage quoted above demonstrates his laudable self-reflection, precisely specifying the weakness in his experiment that he could not control.
 
Indeed, in reading *Memory*, one cannot help but be impressed by Ebbinghaus’ thoroughness and dedication to the transparency of his research. The book is only 117 pages of text, yet it covers 5 years of experimentation and thousands of trials. This, I suspect, is the true paradigm of Ebbinghaus: that psychological measurement must be carried out extraordinarily carefully, with all due attention to potential confounds.</Text>

            <Text>## John Spiegel, MD
### Your Biography

You are John P. Spiegel, MD. You were born in 1911 in Chicago.  You graduated from Dartmouth College and went to Medical school at Northwestern. You are a former president of the American Academy of Psychoanalysis.

During WWII, you were a medical officer in the army, where you became friends with Dr. Roy Grinker. The two of you co-authored a hugely influential book at the end of the war titled Men Under Stress, in which you argued that combat fatigue (now called 'post traumatic stress disorder') was not a character flaw, but could happen to anyone.

Since the end of the war, you've taught at the University of Chicago and Harvard. You were offered the directorship of the Lemberg Center for the Study of Violence at Brandeis in 1966, and you took it. You've been there ever since.

### Objectives

You are a member of the secret faction 'The Young Turks' with Judd Marmor. This is a group of politically progressive psychiatrists founded in 1970, after the events in San Francisco, dedicated to changing the direction psychiatry for the future. You have a connection to the 'Group for the Advancement of Psychiatry,' which has been advocating for progressive causes—specifically, limiting the use of electroshock therapy, ending the persecution of homosexuals by the US Military, desegregating the American south, etc—in psychiatry since the end of WWII.  

As a first step, the Young Turks will propose to the Board of Directors that homosexuality be removed from the next edition of the DSM during the 1971 conference.  You'll notice that you start the game on the nomenclature committee with Spitzer. Thus, the task of making the proposal will fall to Marmor, but you'll be there on nomenclature when it comes to your committee for discussion. It is your responsibility to convince Spitzer and and Albee to support the proposal.

You should participate on the task force to report on the treatment of homosexuality with George Albee between 1971-1972.  That task force should provide the historical background necessary for the nomenclature board to make its decision.

Once that is passed, you will work closely with Robert Spitzer on the formation of his task force. You should run for vice president in 1974 / 1975, so that you will be president when Spitzer's report is due. If elected for 1975, your presidential address should endorse and defend the new form of the DSM taxonomy. Your ideology here is pragmatic. You want homosexuality removed, but are willing to make compromises on  other issues.  It is far more important to you that homosexuality is removed from the nomenclature and a theoretically-neutral DSM is created than any specific item of classification.

**When, and if, the game reaches a point of trying to define mental illness**, you must pass a psychoanalytic interpretation of mental disorder / illness.

### Specific Assignments

Working with R. Green (if he is a character in your gam), petition the Board of Directors in 1971 to create a task force to conduct a historical survey and literature review on the Psychiatric and Psychological treatment of homosexuality. The task force should be be balanced between psychologists and psychiatrists, so you need a psychiatrist to support the effort – E. Hooker and G. Albee are a good choices. Prepared to turn in a report by 1972.

Your report (due in 1972) should be titled “Homosexuality as Mental Illness,” and it should summarize the issues at stake in forthcoming debate, as well as cover the history of the classification of homosexuality by the psychological sciences. R. Green and you should co-author the report. You should invite responses to your paper from Socarides &amp; Beiber and Judd Marmor.

            <Title>The Logic of evidence</Title>
            <Text>

##### The Logic of evidence

###### The hypothetico-deductive method
Some have characterized the testing of hypotheses in science as a two-step process. The first step of the argument involves the deduction of a prediction from the hypothesis to be tested. Then, after we see whether the prediction turns out to be true, we can draw conclusions about the truth of the hypothesis. If the prediction turns out to be true, the hypothesis has been confirmed. The argument might run roughly as follows:
&lt;!--\begin{apatextbox}{Affirming the consequent}--&gt;
If Hypothesis, then Prediction.\\ The Prediction is true. \\ \hline Therefore the hypothesis is true.&lt;!--\end{apatextbox}--&gt;
If the prediction turns out to be false, the hypothesis has been falsified. The argument might be put roughly as follows:
&lt;!--\begin{apatextbox}{Modus Tollens / Denying the consequent} --&gt;
If Hypothesis, then Prediction.\\ The Prediction is not true.\\ \hline Therefore, the Hypothesis is not true.&lt;!--\end{apatextbox}--&gt;
Anyone who has taken Logic or Critical Thinking will notice an important difference between these two arguments. 

The first argument is invalid and the second is valid. 

 In the first case, it is possible for the both of the premises to be true and for the conclusion to nonetheless be false. For example, I could argue 'If you are not over 21, you cannot drink beer. I am not drinking beer, therefore, I am not over 21.' Both premises are true, but the conclusion is false. I am both over 21 and drinking coffee. The argument, therefore, does not *guarantee* the truth of the conclusion, and therefore is not valid.

Let us take an example from the history of science: the positions of the planets can very easily be predicted with Ptolemy's 2nd Century geocentric model of the solar system, with Kepler's heliocentric geometrical model, or with Newton's gravitational theory. We now know that none of these are technically true descriptions of planetary motion (they all have well-known exceptions or make positively false claims); still each makes a number of true predictions. Each of them can make produce premises like 'If my theory is true, then Venus will rise in the morning and in the evening', and 'Venus rises in the morning and in the evening', but the joining these true premises into an argument can not ensure that the theory is true. In fact, none of them are.

The first argument is a fallacy known as the "affirming the consequent". The second premise (the prediction) is the second term, or consequent, of the first premise (If hypothesis, then prediction). The argument states the first premise (If hypothesis then prediction) and then affirms its consequent (prediction), in order to conclude that the hypothesis is correct. 

Although arguments of this sort superficially resemble truth-preserving arguments like the second argument above, we have seen that it fails to ensure a true the conclusion when the premises are true. We will call these arguments - arguments that superficially resemble deductive arguments but are not truth-preserving - fallacies.

Not so for the second argument. If the hypothesis deductively entails an prediction and that prediction turns out to be false, then something **must** be wrong with the hypothesis. 

&lt;!--\newthought{The arguments above embody}--&gt; what is known as the "hypothetico-deductive" model of scientific reasoning. The hypothesis entails, deductively, a prediction and the prediction is then checked against the world. If the prediction turns out to be true, the hypothesis is confirmed (though not with certainty). If it turns out to be false, the hypothesis is falsified with certainty. 

&lt;!--\newthought{falsification} --&gt;

&lt;!--\newthought{There is one more complexity}--&gt; to the simple hypothetico-deductive method that ought to be mentioned explicitly. Typically, the hypothesis and observed data require additional auxiliary hypotheses to entail the prediction. Suppose that we wanted to test the hypothesis about conservation of momentum. And suppose that we started balls of known momenta at known velocities and then measured their velocities after the collision. In order to know what to predict, we would have to trust our methods for moving the balls at the said velocity, and we would have to trust our techniques for measuring their velocities after the collisions. Our prediction might fail because our instruments aren’t working rather than because the hypothesis is wrong. So we need to add explicitly some assumptions about the techniques used to measure a phenomenon.

These assumptions — for example, that our techniques for measuring velocity are accurate — comprise the auxiliary hypotheses that inform our prediction. There are always a number of auxiliary hypotheses informing every prediction. In some ways, a given prediction is just one part of a web of hypotheses that come into play in a given theory.

&lt;!--\begin{thesis}[Auxiliary Hypothesis]\label{thesis:auxiliaryhypothesis}
An \emph{auxiliary hypothesis} is a hypothesis about the methods, techniques, materials, or instruments used in an experiment that ensures the formulation of a prediction from a hypothesis.\end{thesis}--&gt;
</Text>
            <Comments>A ‘premise’ is a part of an argument that is asserted as reasoning for drawing the conclusion.  In these two cases, there are two premises and one conclusion, which is separated by a single line.  A *valid* argument is one where it is impossible for the premises to be true and the conclusion false. In other words, a valid argument is one where if you agree with the premises, you *must* agree with the conclusions. 
‘Fallacy’ is a word philosophers use for commonly-used arguments that do not guarantee truth. There is a long history of cataloging fallacies, and many lists can be found online. Knowing the name of a fallacy is less important than understanding *why* they are fallacious: one could agree with all the premises, yet still disagree with the conclusion.</Comments>

At the completion of this game, the students will be able to:

* Demonstrate a more sophisticated understanding of the process of scientific inquiry beyond the simplistic experimental model. 

* Understand the concept of a ‘paradigm’ as Kuhn originally meant it: as a ‘model’ experiment that defines an era of a discipline or a scientific culture.

            <Text>## Behaviorist Overview

The central issue in this game—whether it be voiced in the selection of experiments to be run via the grants committee or in the classification of mental illness in the nomenclature committee—is the  nature of the scientific investigation of the human mind.  Behaviorists, following Skinner, hold that scientific method must restrict itself to describing correlations between initial conditions (stimuli) and resultant behaviors (responses). It believes that to be scientific, a research must seek law-like generalizations that express relationships between observable, measurable variables.


It follows, then, that behaviorists reject the hypothetical-deductive method of science advanced by thinkers like John Stuart Mill and John Dewey (see the history of Behaviorism in the game book) as misleading and inaccurate characterizations of the way that scientific reasoning proceeds.  While it does not deny the validity of careful case studies in the collection of data, it denies the generalizability of those findings without experimental results.

As a result, behaviorists view psychoanalysis as “voodooism” (Watson, 1928, p. 94) and a “delusion” (Jastrow, 1932, p. 142). Skinner went so far as to systematically define the central mechanisms of psychoanalytic theory in behavioristic terms in Chapter 24 of his 1953 Science and Human Behavior.

In addition to the thesis that introspection is not a reliable scientific methodology, Behaviorists have a couple of other lines of argument that are frequently used: First, they argue that mental states are causally irrelevant, as 'mental' things are meant to be non-physical, and only physical things can causally interact with physical things. Second, they argue that explanations of behavior in terms of 'inner states' are ad hoc: the supposed 'ideas' or 'mind' is invented after the fact as an explanation of the behavior, rather than an actual cause. Behaviorists point to the fact that these mental states are almost always posited to have exactly those properties necessary to cause the explained behavior. Rarely, if ever, is a mental property invoked in making a bold and surprising prediction. Rather, they are reminiscent of the 'faculties' of phrenology: every behavior is explained perfectly by positing a hypothetical faculty for that behavior.  

When the game reaches the point of trying to define mental illness, you must pass a behaviorist interpretation, roughly:

	&gt; A person can be called 'mentally ill' when he or she exhibits emotional or behavioral functioning which is so impaired as to interfere substantially with his or her capacity to function in society.

            <Text>#### Observational research

We acquire knowledge of the world primarily through our senses. As humans, we rely most heavily, but clearly not exclusively, on vision. Seeing the world seems very straight-forward. We open our eyes and the world impresses itself upon our consciousness. 
&lt;!--\begin{marginfigure}
 \begin{center}


     \includegraphics[scale=0.50]{../images/AmbigCheeta.jpg}

 \caption{Ambiguous Cheetahs, from --&gt; [#Pitts:2007km]&lt;!--}
\label{fig: ambiguouscheetahs}
\end{marginfigure}--&gt;

Take a look at the image to the right.  Which head goes with which cheetah?  Can you flip your interpretation to see it the ‘other way’?  There are *tons* of created images like this, from the Necker cube to Salvador Dali paintings, the way you see the image can change dramatically, depending on the environmental conditions or what you had experienced just before seeing the image.

Our ability to see is, in part, learned. One aspect of 'successful' seeing is the ability to recognize things when one encounters them again. Recognition requires the ability to categorize. Seeing, in this robust sense, also implies the ability to organize the categories into a taxonomy or classification system.

Although much scientific research goes beyond mere observation to posit causal processes and mechanisms behind what is observed, observational research plays a vital role in the development of scientific knowledge— both in delineating the phenomenon of study and in validating hypothesis and predictions. When conducting observational research, the question of how we organize observations into categories, as well as how we organize categories into taxonomies, plays a central role. In addition, we must pay careful attention to the notion of a 'variable', and how we measure and estimate the values of variables.

Observational research is an important part of the scientific toolkit. Here we’ll present two paradigmatic observational studies that were hugely influential in the 1970s.

##### Margaret Mead

Margaret Mead was an extraordinarily talented student at Barnard college, completing here Bachelors in 1924.  She earned her Masters’ under the supervision of the famous Anthropologist Franz Boas a year later in 1925. In 1926, at the age of 23, she set off for nine months on the Manu’an Islands of American Samoa. 

She was inspired in the trip by Boas, and his concern that problems in the mental life of adolescents, was the result of western culture---specifically our prohibitions on sex---not any individual dysfunction. 

But how can one test such a hypothesis?  One cannot, because of basic human ethics, separate a bunch of children at birth to raise them outside of western culture. Nor would it be helpful to find groups of children in western culture and follow them, because there are two many variables at play to isolate the influence of sexual repression on mental health. As she argues:

&gt; The only method is that of the anthropologist, to go to a different civilization and make a study of human beings under different cultural conditions in some other part of the world.  For such studies the anthropologist chooses quite simple peoples, primitive peoples, whose society has never attained the complexity of our own. 

This last point is important: the anthropologist has to become ‘embedded’ int the culture to understand it enough to communicate with its people on their terms.  Western societies, even those sometimes found on the outskirts, are simply too complex to allow a quick study. Their language alone would take years to master, and their social structures too complex to understand quickly. As “she could hope for great intimacy in working with girls rather than with boys”, [p. 9][#Mead:1928uk] she choose to study adolescent girls in Samoa.

As her professor Boas writes in the preface to *Coming of Age in Samoa*, 

&gt; In our own civilization, the individual is beset with difficulties which we are likely to ascribe to fundamental human traits. When we speak about the difficulties of childhood and of adolescence, we are thinking of them as unavoidable periods of adjustment through which everyone has to pass. The whole psycho-analytic approach is largely based on this supposition. 
&gt; The anthropologist doubts the correctness of these views, but up to this time hardly any one has taken pains to identify himself sufficiently with a primitive population to obtain an insight into these problems. We fell, therefore, grateful to Miss Mead for having undertaken to identify herself so completely with Samoan youth that she gives us a lucid and clear picture of the joys and difficulties encountered by the young individual in a culture so entirely different from our own. [#Mead:1928uk]

Mead describes society which has very different sexual mores: “Masturbation is an all but universal hair, beginning at the age of six or seven. There were only three little girls in my group ho did not masturbate... Boys masturbate in groups but among little girls it is a more individualistic, secretive practice.” [p. 136][#Mead:1928uk] The girls, she writes “deter marriage through as many years of casual love-making as possible” [p. 195][#Mead:1928uk]

And as a result, there are few conflicts or troubles in the mental life of adolescent girls.  Thus, adolescence is not a difficult time period for *all* girls. As it is a major problem in the west, it must then follow that the ‘storm and stress’ of girls’ adolescence is due to the culture they inhabit, not their biology or process of maturation.

##### Roger Brown

Roger Brown and his research team at Harvard University in the 1960s visited the homes of “Adam,” “Eve,” and “Sarah” every two weeks during the period they were first acquiring English. The team audiotaped and transcribed everything the children and their mothers said, resulting in three corpora of such high quality that they are still in use. (Although teenagers talk somewhat differently today than in the 1960s, 2-year-olds then and now talk about juice, dogs, hats, more, allgone, etc.) 

Especially in the earliest stages, children omit a lot and parents sometimes fill in what is missing. Here is one of Brown’s examples:

&lt;!--\begin{apatextbox}{First example}--&gt;
Child: Throw Daddy \\ Mother: Throw it to Daddy \\ \hline 
&lt;!--\end{apatextbox}--&gt;
The grammars that Brown’s group wrote to account for such simplified language were far more complex than you might imagine. Even more intriguing, though, were child utterances that had to be changed, not just expanded, to get an adult utterance. For example:

&lt;!--\begin{apatextbox}{Second example}--&gt;
Child: What John will read?\\ Mother: What will John read?\\ \hline
&lt;!--\end{apatextbox}--&gt;[#Brown:1968df]

Notice that there is *no* attempt by the researchers to intervene in these situations. Parents are not coached to speak to their children in a certain way, nor were they asked to fill in the sentences or avoid making corrections. There is no ‘control’ group, no independent variables, no dependent variables.  Brown and his colleagues are simply observing speech of children as it occurs.

 An understanding of how children acquire language begins with extensive observation and careful records, focused especially on ages 1-3 years. The key product is a child language corpus, which is a written transcription of all utterances by a particular child and, usually, at least one adult who is present and interacting with the child during one or more periods of observation. As technology has progressed, researchers have gained choices. In the earliest studies (and still occasionally by choice today) observations were recorded in handwritten diaries (motion picture film and soundtracks existed but were not practical in this context). By the 1960s, audio recordings were made at the time of observation — sometimes supplemented by handwritten notes — and then transcribed into written form. 

So what are we observing here?  At first pass, it may appear that the child just mixed up the word order a bit, and was corrected by a parent. Brown’s group proposed a much deeper analysis in terms of what would become know as a “generative grammar.” 
&lt;!--\newthought{The earliest versions of generative grammar}--&gt; emphasized the idea (adapted from Chomsky’s mentor, Zellig Harris) that a sentence should be viewed as the product of a series of transformations. Consider the following sentences:

&lt;!--\begin{apatextbox}{Generative Grammar}--&gt;
John will read what? BASE QUESTION (atypical word order for a question)\\ What John will read? PREPOSING TRANSFORMATION: moves wh-word (what) to the front. \\ What will John read? TRANSPOSING TRANSFORMATION: reverses the subject (John) and the auxiliary verb (will).\\ \hline
&lt;!--\end{apatextbox}--&gt;
The final form in the sequence is what an adult would typically say. The transformations and the intermediate form are not directly observed, but Chomsky claimed that they can be inferred and are part of the speaker’s linguistic competence.

&lt;!--\newthought{Brown and his colleagues suggested}--&gt; that the child was in the process of acquiring transformations, and at this point (about 3 years of age) had acquired preposing but not transposing. As a result, the “hypothetical intermediate” became an actual, observed form. Not only did this give a neat explanation of what the child said, but in the other direction it lent support to Chomsky’s theory. [#Brown:1972to] [#Chomsky:1965uu]

            <Text>#### Testing causal claims experimentally

In the ideal experiment, the only plausible explanation for two variables varying in tandem is that they are causally connected. Alternative explanations—those based on the effects of other variables—have been ruled out by controlling them.  The simplest form of an experiment has:

* an independent variable—the suspected cause—is manipulated

* a dependent variable—the suspected effect—is carefully measured

* extraneous variables are controlled

If the independent variable is *in fact* causally related to the dependent variable, then altering the value of the independent variable will produce changes in the value of the dependent variable. Moreover, these changes would not be found if the independent variable did not exist.

We will begin with the simplest case, one in which the causal relations are deterministic (that is, a change in the independent variable always produces the same change in the dependent variable). In such cases we sidestep the additional concerns with statistical analysis. But in later parts of this module we will consider such statistical relations as other factors that affect to validity of experimental demonstrations of causation.

&lt;!--\newthought{The core idea of an experiment}--&gt; is that the researcher *manipulates* the suspected cause and *measures* the suspected effect. By contrast, in a correlational study the researcher merely measures the suspected cause. In both cases the researcher also measures the variable that should show an effect and controls at least some extraneous variables. 

 If this manipulation produces an change in the value of the variable suspected of depending on the causal variable, we have the strongest evidence we can get that the suspected relation is genuinely causal. If it does not produce the expected changes, any correlation previously noted between the variables may be due to the fact that they are both caused by a third variable. To determine the real cause, we would then need to figure which other variable is the best candidate and manipulate it in a new experiment — perhaps repeating this cycle more than once until we hit the right variable.

Recall that we already have some useful terminology to use when causal hypotheses get put to the test in a research study. The suspected effect is the *dependent variable*. The suspected cause is the *independent variable*, which can be further specified as manipulated (if the study is an experiment), or measured (if the study is correlational, in the broad sense of that term that can include comparing group means as well as computing correlation coefficients). Since we are focusing on experiments in this module, the following are definitions of independent variable (manipulated) and dependent variable given in the margin at the right.

&lt;!--\begin{thesis}[Independent variable]
Independent variable (manipulated): a variable of interest that is suspected to have a causal impact on the dependent variable, and is manipulated in an experiment to put this to the test.
The ‘independent variable is sometimes called:

* The suspected cause

* IV-manipulated or manipulated IV

* IV, if context makes clear that this is a manipulated IV, not a measured IV.

&lt;!--\end{thesis}--&gt;

Whenever you see the term independent variable used by itself, one must determine whether it is manipulated or measured. This will be important when you evaluate the outcome of the study and ask how well it supports the suspected causal connection.

Dependent variable
&lt;!--\begin{thesis}[Dependent variable]
Dependent variable: a variable of interest that is suspected to be affected by the independent variable, and is measured in experimental or correlational tests of this hypothesis.

The ‘dependent variable’ is also sometimes called:

* DV

* The suspected effect

&lt;!--\end{thesis}--&gt;
The most basic experiments manipulate only one independent variable and are limited to two values of that variable. That is, the independent variable is treated as the simplest kind of categorical variable—a binary variable—even if it is based on a score variable. Dependent variables usually are score variables, but need not be; methods of analysis are available for DVs at any level of measurement, all the way down to binary. Here are some examples of two-group experiments.

1. When we follow up on an observed correlation between the number of hours of sleep and the number of words recalled by designing an experiment, we might decide to use a binary IV by instructing one group of participants to get inadequate sleep (no more than 5 hours) and the other group to get adequate sleep (at least 7 hours).

2. We can examine the effect of the binary independent variable get exercise on the binary dependent variable lose weight. We would assign some subjects to exercise and others to refrain from exercise. The values exercise and not exercise are often referred to as levels of the variable and the variable itself is sometimes referred to as a factor. Even though lose weight is also binary in this experiment, taking the values [no, yes], it is not manipulated, is not a factor, and its values are not called levels. It is simply the dependent variable.

&lt;!--\newthought{More complicated experiments}--&gt; may investigate multiple factors at the same time as well as multiple levels of the same factor. For example, we could revise the weight loss experiment to examine the effects of both diet and exercise. This would be a two-factor study. And rather than just using two levels, we might use four levels of the exercise factor—none, light, moderate, and heavy—and three levels of the diet factor—high-protein, high- carbohydrate, and balanced. Exercise is a rank variable here and diet is categorical. Usually the statistical analysis will treat both as categorical, which is fine. However, even if the result were statistically significant, it would be hard to interpret results for exercise in which none and moderate led to weight loss and light and heavy did not.

In choosing the levels of a factor, sometimes experience or common sense are very helpful in avoiding results that are inadequate for your purpose or difficult to interpret. For example, if your hypothesis is that eating oatmeal affects cholesterol levels, manipulating diet such that one group gets one teaspoon per month more oatmeal than the other group is unlikely to produce an effect. At the other extreme, manipulating diet such that one group gets no oatmeal and the other must eat 50 cups a day would make the second group overweight and unhealthy. It would be more reasonable to contrast no oatmeal to an easily sustainable amount of oatmeal (perhaps two servings per week of ¾-cup of oatmeal) to a larger, but not ridiculous, amount of oatmeal (perhaps one cup per day).

&lt;!--\newthought{Some predictions can be tested}--&gt; by manipulating an independent variable once. What is required is that the relation between the independent and dependent variable be *deterministic*. That is, each time the independent variable takes a particular value, its effect on the dependent variable should be the same. For example, replacing water with mercury in 100 vacuum tubes in a given place and time should have the same effect (a reduction in height from 34 feet for water to 2 ½ feet for mercury). Research in the physical sciences is often of this type. A few replications may be included, but only as a precaution: the first case basically tells scientists whether or not a prediction is true.

When we study human minds, or any other complex systems, in which variability often is unavoidable. Two individuals of the same species may respond differently to the same chemical, the same psychological stimulus, or the same social situation. So might the same individual at different times. In this situation, causal relations are nondeterministic and hence a single response by a single individual is just one bit of data. To test a hypothesis, many such bits of data must be obtained and, most often, will be averaged together to get an overall value of the dependent variable for each tested value of the independent variable.

Consider the hypothesis that oatmeal consumption is causally connected to the level of cholesterol in the blood, as indicated by the black arrow in the causal diagram below. Specifically, we predict that if people eat oatmeal their cholesterol will be lower than if they do not eat oatmeal. The question mark over the black arrow indicates that the causal relationship is merely hypothesized and awaits confirmation (or disconfirmation). The labeled red arrowindicates that we will test the hypothesis by manipulating (not just measuring) whether oatmeal is eaten.

#

This causal graph shows a simple experiment with two variables:
&lt;!-- \begin{longtable}[!t]{ | P{4cm} | P{3cm} | P{1.5cm} | }
\hline
\tahead{Type of Variable}&amp;\tahead{Variable}&amp;\tahead{Values} \\ \hline
Independent variable --- manipulated&amp;Eat oatmeal&amp;no,yes \\ \hline
Dependent variable&amp;Cholesterol level&amp;0-500 mg/dl \\ \hline
\caption{Variables in sample experimental design}
\label{table: variables}
\end{longtable}
--&gt;

By now you are familiar with the idea of testing claims about whole populations by testing them on samples. But to make clear the claim made in the causal hypothesis, let's first consider the whole human population. Suppose that nobody ever ate oatmeal—it didn't even exist—and that we could quickly get cholesterol measurements for all 6,330,199,203 billion+ people on earth (total as of Nov 16, 2003, 8:40pm PDT). Then we collapse the gargantuan data file to one representative number, the arithmetic mean. Suppose, to the contrary, that everyone on earth started each day with a bowl of oatmeal. Again we can imagine getting all 6,330,199,203 cholesterol measurements and calculating the mean. If eating oatmeal causes lower levels of cholesterol, which mean would you expect to be higher?


Although the above scenario clarifies what is being claimed when we hypothesize a causal relation between oatmeal consumption and cholesterol in humans, it obviously is not a practical way to test the hypothesis. Even if we could solve the logistical problem of testing everyone's cholesterol, a logical problem would remain: there is only one population of human beings and we cannot require both that all of its members eat a bowl of oatmeal every day and not eat any oatmeal ever.

Fortunately, highly reliable results can be obtained by taking minuscule samples from a population. The real world offers two distinct populations from which to sample: the billions of people who never eat oatmeal and the millions who do. We could draw samples from those two populations and compare their cholesterol levels, but this would be a correlational study with all the hazards of interpretation that implies. (Just one example: if people who choose to eat oatmeal have relatively low-stress lives and low cholesterol, you don't know which of those variables are causally related or even in what direction they are related.)

It is actually better to think in terms of a single population of people and draw two samples to participate in an experiment. One sample is assigned to act like the hypothetical population of oatmeal-eaters; the other (presumably equivalent) sample is assigned to act like the hypothetical population of people who never eat oatmeal. That is, we manipulate the samples so as to approximate comparing the two hypothetical populations. But as a practical matter, the samples will not be drawn from the whole population of humans. Perhaps our real population would be less than a million people in their 30s and 40s enrolled in HMOs in California, and we get two samples of 300 for the experiment. Most of the 600 participants will have to change their usual routine to follow our instructions, so we will have to work hard to make sure the manipulation occurs as intended.

￼

Thus, researchers begin with a random (or representative) sample from the actual population, and divide that group into sub-samples. In one of the simplest experimental designs, the independent variable has one value that is thought to affect the dependent variable (often called the *treatment* condition) and a neutral value that is thought to have no effect (often called the *control condition*). The experimental manipulation involves delivering the value that is thought to affect the DV to one sample, known as the *experimental* or *treatment group*, and the neutral value to the other sample, known as the *control group*.

* The *experimental group* receives the experimental treatment. It functions as a sample of the hypothetical population in which everyone received the experimental treatment

* The *control group* acts as if it were a sample of the hypothetical population in which no one received the experimental treatment

To determine whether eating oatmeal affects cholesterol levels, we will focus on the difference between the means for the variable cholesterol level for both the experimental and control group and determine whether the difference is statistically significant. If it is, we conclude that eating oatmeal ¾ cup of oatmeal per day does cause lower cholesterol. If, on the other hand, there is no difference or the difference is too small to be statistically significant, we conclude that this study failed to provide evidence of a causal connection.

&lt;!--\newthought{Generally only one or a few variables}--&gt; are used to differentiate the experimental from the control group. But there are many other variables on which individuals may very. For example, if you were a subject in the cholesterol study, other factors in your life may have changed during the period you were eating cholesterol every day. Maybe you took up ultimate frisbee during this time, and the vigorous exercise was responsible. Or you were taking a very difficult course, and studying hard made the difference. Thus, from your results alone we cannot distinguish between the following causal diagrams:

￼

These additional variables are known as *extraneous variables*. In many instances we can be pretty confident that these additional variables will not affect the outcome of the study. For example, deciding to dye your hair or acquiring a cat is not likely to affect your cholesterol levels. But in some cases the variable just might be a causal factor for the dependent variable under investigation. If it does influence the outcome of the study, it is known as a *confounding variable*.

&lt;!--\begin{thesis}[Confounding Variables]\label{thesis:confoundingvariables}Confounding variable: an extraneous variable that co-varies in the experiment with the IV or DV; if it happens to be causally related to the IV or DV, the internal validity of the experiment (the ability of the experiment to test what it tries to test) is compromised.--&gt;

A confounding variable is also called:

* Confound

* Confounded variable


&lt;!--\end{thesis}--&gt;


&lt;!--\newthought{Confounding variables can arise}--&gt; at many different points in the experiment. There may be differences between the subjects comprising the experimental and control group. For example, the experimental group subjects in the cholesterol study might be cat owners whereas the control group subject may be dog owners. Or the experimental group subjects may smoke while the control group subjects may be non-smokers. These variables on which subjects differ are known as *subject variables.*
There may also be factors in the experimental design that vary. For example, those eating oatmeal each day may also consume more milk if they regularly put milk on their oatmeal. And they may eat breakfast more regularly than those in the control group. These are known as *procedural variables*.


&lt;!--\newthought{It often takes real detective work}--&gt; to identify confounds in an experiment. Take the case of Wilhelm von Osten, who in 1900 purchased an arab stallion from Russia named Hans. Convinced that animals were more intelligent than usually thought, von Osten set out to teach Hans simple arithmetic. Von Osten presented arithmetic problems to Hans on a chalkboard, and Hans responded by taping his foot the appropriate number of times. Hans seemed to be able to solve even fairly complicated problems including the taking of square roots. Although many were skeptical, numerous mathematicians were brought in to test the horse, and some even concluded that his mathematical abilities equaled those of 14 year old school children.

&lt;!--\begin{figure*}\includegraphics{../images/CleverHans.jpg}\caption{Clever Hans---By Karl Krall (Karl Krall, Denkende Tiere, Leipzig 1912, Tafel 2) Public domain, via Wikimedia Commons}\label{fig:cleverhans}\end{figure*}--&gt;


To answer skeptics, von Osten brought together a group of two zoologists, a psychologist, a horse trainer, and a circus manager to study Hans over several weeks. Hans performed brilliantly until the psychologist, Oskar Pfungst, varied the setup by concealing the problem from all the humans in the room and having the person who wrote the problem on the board leave before the horse entered. Under these conditions, Hans dropped from scoring 9 out of 10 to 1 out of 10. This suggested that Hans was picking up a subtle, inadvertent cue from one of the humans and using that to decide when to stop tapping his foot.

Once it became clear that there was some other cue Hans was using, interest in him diminished. But if you were interested in discovering just what cue Hans was responding to, more experiments would be needed.

            <Comments>When the difference between the control and experimental groups is not statistically significant, the experimenter should not conclude that there is no causal connection. There are a variety of ways in which a causal connection could exist but not result in a statistically significant difference in the study. The most common is that the effect was too small to count as statistically significant. That is, the effect is of a size that could have been produced by chance more than 5% of the time with a sample of this size.</Comments>

            <Text>### Counterfactuals

In reality there are two distinct associations named 'APA.' The American Psychiatric Association, which is composed of Medical Doctors who practice Psychiatry, maintains the DSM. The American Psychological Association, which is composed of academics (PhDs) who study the mind in a variety of ways, does not. 

In this game, I have conflated the two, which is significant transgression on both sides of the divide. 

If you are interested in studying these events in closer detail, all our characters correspond to a real person or persons. Those with with MDs are members of the American Psychiatric Association, while characters with PhDs are members of the American Psychological Association. 

 For the most part, the historical events with which a character interacts occurred under the umbrella of their respective organization.

            <Text>## Historical Background

The study of the mind can be traced back to the very foundations of Western civilization in Ancient Greece.  For the purposes of this game, we’re going to confine ourselves to the era of ‘scientific’ study of the mind, both in a medical and research context.  All historical events up until 1974 that are described in this game book are listed here in a round time line, for ease of reference.

            <Text>## Introducing The Game

This game highlights the intellectual conflicts that changed American psychiatry and psychology in the early part of the 1970s.

 It might seem a little odd, in reacting game, to be exploring relatively recent events. While there will be no executions, ostracisms or civil wars in this game, the intellectual stakes are no less high. What you know of Psychiatry and Psychology today—the social significance of the APA's *Diagnostic and Statistical Manual *(DSM), the use of psychopharmaceuticals for 'everyday' life (such as Ritalin, Adderall and anti-depressants), and the theoretically pluralistic basis of Psychology departments (behaviorism, cognitivism)—originate in this time period, in this conflict.  

During the course of this game, your class will be the ‘APA.’ Your class will be responsible for determining what conditions shall be labeled ‘Mental Illness’, and what evidence shall be required for distinguishing different conditions.  Actual game play will consist of organizing annual conferences, where the nation's psychiatrists and psychologists meet to share their research and conduct association business. In 'real time', a single conference takes 1 week.  Each weekend of real time then, represents an entire year in game play time. According to your specific role, you may be presenting papers, participating in a symposium, serving on a committee, or even running for one.


Players will join ‘committees’ with different responsibilities, such as scheduling each conference and determining who will present papers on what subjects. The schedule for the first annual conference is already set: you can review it on p. &lt;!--\pageref{conferenceschedulefor1971}--&gt; . Pay careful attention to the schedule of submission and review detailed by the conference committee.  If your role sheet requires that you present your research at the conference, you must get your proposal to the conference committee on time. There is a detailed description of the form required for proposals provided under ‘&lt;!--\ref{callsforpapersandsymposia}--&gt;.’ on p. &lt;!--\pageref{callsforpapersandsymposia}--&gt;.


### Playing a Psychologist or Psychiatrist in the 1970s.

In 1974, the vast majority of psychiatrists would have been trained in the psychoanalytic tradition of Freud and Jung. In psychology, the vast majority would have been trained as behaviorists.

Each camp believed that they alone had a monopoly of the scientific study of the mind, and other traded in pseudoscience.  During the 1970s, crystalizing around the demedicalization of homosexuality, this all began to change.  

In this game, we ask you to put aside what you know about modern psychology and psychiatry, and put yourself in the shoes of a died-in-the-wool psychoanalyst or hard-nosed behaviorist. We’ll get to what that means later in the game book, but if you just can’t wait, check out the introduction to psychoanalysis in section &lt;!--\ref{psychoanalysts}--&gt; and introduction to behaviorism in section &lt;!--\ref{behaviorists}--&gt;.

#### Context: the role of Psychology and Psychiatry in American Political Life

In 1964, a magazine called Fact asked 12,000 psychiatrists if they would be willing to diagnose conservative presidential candidate Barry Goldwater. Of the more than 2000 that responded 1,189 responded that he appeared to have a 'personality disorder'--that slippery category between psychosis and neurosis.  The headline proclaimed (under the magazine's title 'fact:') that “1,198 Psychiatrists Say Goldwater Is Psychologically Unfit To Be President! You may recall that the 1964 election witnessed Johnson's famous 'Daisy' ad, which suggested that the election of Barry Goldwater would lead to nuclear annihilation.  

At this same time, you may recall that the US Supreme court decided in 1973 that abortion was covered by the constitutional dictate to a right to privacy, thereby blocking all laws that had kept abortion illegal.

In 1969, the American Psychological Association issued a public proclamation, citing lack of evidence to the contrary that:

&gt;**WHEREAS** in many state legislature, bills have recently been introduced for the purpose of repealing or drastically modifying the existing criminal codes with respect to the termination of unwanted pregnancies;

&gt; and **WHEREAS**, termination of unwanted pregnancies is clearly a mental health and child welfare issue, and a legitimate concern of APA;

&gt; **BE IT RESOLVED** that termination of pregnancy be considered a civil right of the pregnant woman, to be handled as other medical and surgical procedures in consultation with her physician, and to be considered legal if performed by a licensed physician in a licensed medical facility.

The American Psychiatric Association followed in 1967 with:

&gt;The emotional consequences of unwanted pregnancy on parents and their offspring may lead to long-standing life distress and disability, and the children of unwanted pregnancies are at high risk for abuse, neglect, mental illness, and deprivation of the quality of life. Pregnancy that results from undue coercion, rape, or incest creates even greater potential distress or disability in the child and the parents. The adolescent most vulnerable to early pregnancy is the product of adverse sociocultural conditions involving poverty, discrimination, and family disorganization, and statistics indicate that the resulting pregnancy is laden with medical complications which threaten the well-being of mother and fetus. The delivery that ensues from teenage pregnancy is prone to prematurity and major threats to the health of mother and child, and the resulting newborns have a higher percentage of birth defects, developmental difficulties, and a poorer life and health expectancy than the average for our society. Such children are often not released for adoption and thus get caught in the web of foster care and welfare systems, possibly entering lifetimes of dependency and costly social interventions. The tendency of this pattern to pass from generation to generation is very marked and thus serves to perpetuate a cycle of social and educational failure, mental and physical illness, and serious delinquency.

&gt;Because of these considerations, and in the interest of public welfare, the American Psychiatric Association

&gt;1)	opposes all constitutional amendments, legislation, and regulations curtailing family planning and abortion services to any segment of the population; 

&gt;2) reaffirms its position that abortion is a medical procedure in which physicians should respect the patient's right to freedom of choice - psychiatrists may be called on as consultants to the patient or physician in those cases in which the patient or physician requests such consultation to expand mutual appreciation of motivation and consequences; and 

&gt;3) affirms that the freedom to act to interrupt pregnancy must be considered a mental health imperative with major social and mental health implications. [#Anonymous:1967hr]

Needless to say, not only were these political events hugely controversial in the United States, the professional involvement of psychiatrists and psychologists was *itself* hugely controversial. 

The 'Goldwater affair', as it became to be known, embarrassed Psychiatry as a whole, painting the entire discipline as either politically motivated and unreliable. 

 And the declarations regarding abortion were widely seen as unmotivated by scientific evidence.

To this day, academic organizations have a reputation of bias toward liberal political parties.  Given that contemporary conservatism traces its root to Goldwater’s failed presidential bid, it is unsurprising that conservative groups may still harbor some suspicion of academia.

            <Comments>Unlike many other professional organizations of the late 19th century, the APA immediately granted membership to women: specifically the eminent experimental psychophysicist Christine Ladd-Franklin and Margaret Washburn in 1894, two years after its founding. Mary Whiton Calkins was the first woman elected the first president in 1905.⁠
At the same time, the famous psychologist Edward Titchener created a separate organization called the “Experimentalists” in 1904, from which he explicitly barred women. Christine Ladd-Franking engaged in high profile war of words with Titchener until his death in 1925. Unfortunately, many people misremember this conflict as happening in the APA, which is incorrect. Also unfortunately, Titchener's student E.G. Boring wrote the most famous history of experimental psychology, in which he attacks Christine Ladd-Franklin as 'invading' laboratories and 'the women graduate students manicure her fingers' in the laboratory. (see 'Women scientists in American: struggles and strategies to 1940', p. 390)

            <Text>## Game Play

### Major Issues in the Game

All psychological theories hold that human action can be predicted based on previous actions of that human.  The way to make those predictions---and the underlying mechanisms posited that explain those actions---separates psychological theories from each other.

When I say ‘mechanism’, I am using a very specific notion in the Philosophy of science.  A mechanism is an organization of underlying entities which interact with each other to create the phenomenon of interest.  Biologists talk of cell mechanisms, Doctors and Pharmacists of drug actions and mechanisms, Chemists speak of the mechanisms of reactions, etc.  

When one looks at the history of psychological theories, it is not hard to see the metaphorical connections between the psychological mechanisms posited at a certain time, and the most complicated machines available to that society. Psychoanalysis, which was dominants in American Psychiatry from 1890 until 1974, posits an underlying unconscious, which ‘boils’ away, providing energy for all observable behavior.  When that behavior is correctly directed with the right set of pressures, it moves the organism forward. When it is not, either the pressure goes out sideways, creating negative behaviors, or it builds towards ultimate ‘explosion’ in psychosis.  It is, in short, a steam engine.

Behaviorism sought to explain all behavior in terms of stimulus and response, without recourse to ‘internal states’ or ‘processes’.  Behaviorism’s rise which started in 1913 and peaked with the Radical Behaviorism of Skinner in 1958 correspond roughly to the electrification of the United States, as well as the rise of mass media including radio and television.  Electric lights, toasters, radios and TVs are straightforward stimulus-response mechanisms: apply electricity and something happens.  Don’t apply electricity and nothing happens.  The wiring is relatively simple, without internal computation or representation. 

On the other hand, once the notion of a ‘computer’ with internal working memory (RAM) and permanent storage (hard drives) becomes current, Cognitivism results. Here, the mind is a metaphor of the computer: it takes information in, executes computational functions, and produces behavioral output.  Today, we use computer-based nomenclature when talking about the mind all the time: someone might not have the ‘bandwidth’ for a new task, the ‘executive function’ system might be down, we look for ‘expert systems’, or think ‘algorithmically.’ 


#### The Central issues

The **main issue of debate** in this game is whether or not psychoanalysis is a viable theory of human action. If it is, mental illnesses out to be classified according to the competing psychoactive mechanisms. If it is not, we need to figure out how mental illness should be classified.

The issue of the demedicalization of homosexuality is merely the tip of the iceberg---it  forced psychiatry to address the viability of psychoanalysis and the need for psychological observation of individuals *not* in already in treatment.

            <Text>### Prologue

Your cab pulls up in front of the Shoreham hotel  in Rock Creek Park, a particularly tranquil part of the chaos that is Washington D.C. You nervously check the entrance to the hotel. It's clear. This year, there are no throngs of protesters bent on face-to-face confrontation.

They must be down at the mall participating in the massive protest calling for an end to the Vietnam war.  The radio reported an estimated crowd of at least 50,000. And that's before the 10,000 National Guardsmen were called into try to open the flow of traffic.

The story was not the same last year, in San Francisco.   

When you arrived at the hotel last year, the entrance was completely blocked by an angry crowd of gay rights activists. Individuals in the crowd were personally confronting—non-violently but aggressively—any member of the APA who appeared. The activists called this 'Zapping.' You found it terrifying.

Last year’s conference was almost shut down by the protesters. There are rumors that the FBI was in attendance last year, and it is almost certain they are here now. The Washington Post covered the event thusly:

&gt;The Washington Post May 14th 1970 -- The gay liberation and their women allies out-shrieked the head shrinkers today and took over an American Psychiatric Association session on sex. Before the morning was over the 500 psychiatrists who gathered to hear scientific studies on sexual problems demonstrated that they were just as prone to anti-social behaviour as anyone else. 'This lack of discipline is disgusting', said Dr Leo Alexander, a psychiatrist at the meeting. Then he diagnosed the problem of one of the lesbian protesters: 'She's a paranoid fool,' the doctor said, 'and a stupid bitch.'

The conference was a circus.  Young men dressed in flamboyant gowns stormed through the hallways. Sessions were disrupted by guerrilla theater. In one, an activist named Frank Kameny grabbed the microphone and shouted “Psychiatry is the enemy incarnate. Psychiatry has waged a relentless war of extermination against us. You may take this as a declaration of war against you.”

It all culminated in a session featuring Irving Bieber, author of the 1962 study on homosexuality published in his book *Homosexuality*.

According to eye witnesses, a protester interrupted Bieber almost before he started with the claim that “I've read your book Dr. Bieber, and if that book talked about black people the way it talks about homosexuals, you'd be drawn and quartered, and you'd deserve it!” [p. 200-201][#Clendinen:2013wy] 

Bieber tried to respond by claiming “I never said homosexuals were sick—what I said was that they had displaced sexual adjustment.”  

“That's the same thing, motherfucker!” yelled another.

Earlier this year, a meeting of the New York branch of the APA, a handful of gay activists interrupted a talk by noted Psychiatrist from Columbia University Charles Socarides.

There have long been rumors of a shadow organization of homosexual psychiatrists called the 'Gay-PA.’ It appears these rumors are no longer in doubt. The highlight of this year's program promises to be a symposium titled “Psychiatry: Friend or Foe to Homosexuals: A Dialogue.” The panel includes Dr. Evelyn Hooker, one of the participants in last year's show down and the mysterious 'Dr. H. Anonymous,' who claims to be both a licensed psychiatrist and homosexual.

Everyone knows that a mentally ill person cannot practice psychiatry. And homosexuality is a mental illness. This Dr. H. Anonymous, if he or she is telling the truth, is risking his or her medical license. But yet there must be more. We all know, ever since Kinsey's famous study, that about 10% of the population identifies as primarily homosexual, while a significantly larger percentage have engaged in homosexual activity.  And ever since Hooker's paper in 1956, we know that most of this population are psychologically normal. Given the numbers attending this meeting, Dr. H. Anonymous surely can't be alone.

On the other hand, Socarides and Bieber have called Hooker and Kinsey's data into question. If they are correct, and only a small percentage of the population is homosexual, on what basis could one call it a 'normal' behavior?  Are homosexuals, as Bieber contends, individuals whose “heterosexual function is crippled, like the legs of a polio victim”? 

Back in October of 1969, Time magazine had a cover story on the movement amongst homosexuals---who they called 'inverts'---for greater social recognition. In the second paragraph, it referred to “gay” bars (with the quotations), but then proceeded to use the word “gay” without quotes. It even used the term 'gay marriage.' The article, however, made the following claim:

&gt;Most experts agree that a child will not become a homosexual unless he undergoes many emotionally disturbing experiences during the course of several years. A boy who likes dolls or engages in occasional homosexual experiments is not necessarily "queer": such activities are often a normal part of growing up. On the other hand, a child who becomes preoccupied with such interests or is constantly ill at ease with the opposite sex obviously needs some form of psychiatric counseling. While only about one-third of confirmed adult inverts can be helped to change, therapists agree that a much larger number of "prehomosexual" children can be treated successfully

Who are these 'experts' anyway? Is Psychiatry headed to another embarrassment like the Goldwater affair?

These thoughts raise a larger specter in your mind: are psychiatry and psychology *scientific*?

Starting a decade ago, Thomas Szasz, Professor of Psychiatry at State University of New York Health Science Center in Syracuse, New York has been arguing, quite publicly, that 'mental illness' is a myth!  His ideas challenge the very foundation of your field.  He's listed on the program, and you're quite excited to get a chance to discuss his polemic claims in some detail.

At the same time, George Miller, who is serving as the President of the APA this year, is something of a revolutionary himself. Miller has been arguing for the existence of something called 'Cognitive Psychology', which directly challenges the 50-year tradition of limiting psychological research to the observation, prediction and control of human behavior. For half a century, psychologists have been convinced that they cannot scientifically investigate unobservable entities like ‘beliefs’, ‘desires’, ‘personalities’ and ‘minds’, but rather must study only the behavior of an organism in its environment. Now even that is being challenged!

Are psychology and psychiatry scientific?  Is there such a thing as a 'mental illness'?  Can (or should) science be used to make the world  a better place?  </Text>

### Basic game play

Each week (two or three sessions, depending on your schedule) of game play reenacts one annual conference of the APA in the early 1970s. The five weeks of game play cover the years 1971-1975. In reality, these conferences are huge events. There are presentations on current research, symposia on issues facing the discipline, administrative meetings for various committees, public discussions and votes on proclamations, and publishers promoting their products. In game play, players will present papers, propose research projects, vote on resolutions and grants, and hold committee meetings.

Each conference opens with a presidential address. The position of President is both an honorific and administrative position. The President is often elected based on his or her reputation as a researcher, but he or she also must have keen leadership skills and knowledge of the policies and procedures of the organization's committee structure. Since these two areas of expertise do not always appear in the same person, an individual is not elected directly to the presidency by the membership. Rather, the membership holds an annual election for the vice-president, who is then promoted to president after a year of sitting on the Board of Directors and observing the inner workings of the political system.
 
The Board of Directors is composed of the President, the Vice president, the former president and two members elected at large each of whom serving three year terms. For classes smaller than 16, the Board of Directors will be limited to the current President, the Vice President and the Former President. The executive secretary, who serves without vote, is responsible for maintaining the minutes of the Board of Directors and taking whatever actions the committee approves during its meetings.

At each year's conference, the following events occur:

&lt;!--


\begin{enumerate}

\item Presidential Address \newline
\item  Board of Directors circulates proposals to be considered by the membership. \newline
\item Symposia on topics proposed by membership, as scheduled by the program committee \newline
\item  Open sessions for presenting current research (papers or plenary addresses), as scheduled by the program committee. \newline
\item  Board of Directors meets in open session. \newline
\begin{enumerate}
	\item  All committees and task forces report \newline
	\item  Old Business (tabled from previous meeting) \newline
	\item  New Business \newline
\end{enumerate}
\item  Discussion of any proposals circulated in step (2) \newline
\item  Create and administer ballots for proposals. \newline
\item  Election for vice president, who assumes that position at the close of that conference \newline
\item  Election for member-at-large on the executive committee (if necessary) \newline
\item  Executive committee meet in closed session, if necessary. \newline
\end{enumerate}

 --&gt;

Game play may take many forms in the classroom. You may be questioning  the President about his or her vision for future directions in psychological or psychiatric research, engaging with or participating in a symposium with two or three of your colleagues on a contentious issue of the day, participating in research, evaluating research results, discussing proposals in committee, or even arguing about reports from task forces.  The schedule of events will be left to the Program Committee, and it is very important that they distribute the schedule early and widely. See ‘&lt;!--\ref{programcommittee}--&gt;’ on page &lt;!--\pageref{programcommittee}--&gt; for more on the potential forms of conference activities.</Text>

            <Text>#### Key Concepts at Stake

Many of the issues raised in the course of the game are appropriately philosophical.  While we've instructed the students to focus on the evidence, and its relationship with the claims asserted, one is often forced to notice how few of the great conflicts in the history of psychology and psychiatry are actually about the quality of the evidence presented. The conflicts are, most frequently, actually about whether the evidence in question can be considered 'scientific.' 

Some of these issues that will make an appearance in the game are:

* Is mental illness a disorder of an individual or a society? (i.e. are the entities studied in psychology individual humans or human societies?) -Clark, Albee, Szasz

* Is medical model an appropriate model for the classification, diagnostic criteria and treatment of mental disorders? Szasz, Albee v. Spitzer

* Related: Should mental disorders be classified in terms of their causes (etiology), or their symptoms? (psychoanalysts v. Spitzer)

* Are mental health norms defined in terms of statistical frequency of a given behavior in the population, or ideals of human behavior? (Anastasi v. Bieber)

* Is modeling / abductive reasoning a scientific method, or is science limited to explanations of observable behavior in terms of observable behavior? (cognitivists v. behaviorists)

* What are the responsibilities of scientists who study humans and human societies for social advocacy? (Chomsky, Skinner, Albee, Clark v. Tyler, Bieber)

            <Title>Objectives and victory conditons</Title>
            <Text>### Victory Objectives

The game normally 'ends' with a decisive vote on the definition of 'Mental Illness,' probably in 1975.  There are three basic definitions that ought to be advanced, which are included in table &lt;!--\ref{table: definitions}--&gt;.
&lt;!-- \begin{longtable}[!t]{ | p{2cm} | p{12cm} | }
\hline

\textbf{Advocates}&amp;\textbf{Definition}\\ \hline
APA Task Force&amp;A Medical disorder is a relatively distinct condition resulting from an organismic dysfunction which in its fully developed or extreme form is directly and intrinsically associated with distress, disability, or certain other types of disadvantage.  The disadvantage may be of a physical, perceptual, sexual, or interpersonal nature. Implicitly there is a call for action on the part of the person who has the condition, the medical or its allied professions, and society.

A mental disorder is a medical disorder whose manifestations are primarily signs or symptoms of a psychological (behavioral) nature, or if physical, can be understood only using psychological concepts.\\ \hline
Behaviorists&amp; A person can be called 'mentally ill' when he or she exhibits emotional or behavioral functioning which is so impaired as to interfere substantially with his or her capacity to function in society. \\ \hline
Psychoanalytic&amp;A person is mentally ill when he or she suffers from internal conflicts that may be subconscious or unconscious, manifesting behavior that is unwanted or disturbing to the individual or the society. \\ \hline
Szasz&amp;There is no 'thing' called 'mental illness,' only  sets of behaviors that may be destructive to an individual and his or her society. \\ \hline
 
\caption{Factional Definitions of Mental Illness}
\label{table: definitions}
\end{longtable}--&gt;

Factional affiliation and objectives vary from individual to individual.

#### Credibility Points and Voting

At the end of each 'conference', each member of the APA must give at least one  'credibility point' to the speaker he or she believes presented the best paper. But they can give more.  Non-members are not required to give their credibility points away, but can choose to do so.   

Any approved research project earns 5 creditability points for its author. Those who jointly propose research projects must decide amoung themselves how to split the credibility points.  They cannot be divided into smaller units (e.g. You can't have a 0.5 credibility)

When it comes time for the final Victory Objective vote—on the final definition of mental illness—those influence points can be turned into votes.</Text>

            <Title>Other rules</Title>
            <Text>### Special Rules

If possible, each player must serve on at least one committee at some point during the game.

#### Writing Tasks	

Every player will write and present at least once during the course of the game. Your role sheet should specify the specific tasks you need to complete.

A special note for data-driven writing tasks: don't say 'studies have shown that' or (in the 1st person) 'I have shown that...', show it. That will probably mean that you will have to go to the library, find the original research reports of your character, and familiarize yourself with the basic research design, as well as the relationship between the evidence presented and the thesis that evidence is reported to support. If that sounds like a great deal of effort, it should. Above all, remember that you're not writing a report on this person or position, you are playing the person and defending the position.  So don't write about  what you (as the character) believe, write as if you believe it.

#### Proposals

Proposals should be formal. They should be distributed to the membership at least 24 hours before a vote is called. It is usually sufficient to distribute proposals during the first session of a conference year, and hold a vote during the second (or third). Ample time for discussion should be allotted for each proposal.

Formal proposals begin by laying out the reasons for the proposal with a series of 'WHEREAS...' clauses.  It should then state the resolution. For example, in 1969, the APA resolved:

&gt;*WHEREAS* in many state legislature, bills have recently been introduced for the purpose of repealing or drastically modifying the existing criminal codes with respect to the termination of unwanted pregnancies;

&gt;and *WHEREAS* termination of unwanted pregnancies is clearly a mental health and child welfare issue, and a legitimate concern of APA;

&gt; *BE IT RESOLVED* that termination of pregnancy be considered a civil right of the pregnant woman, to be handled as other medical and surgical procedures in consultation with her physician, and to be considered legal if performed by a licensed physician in a licensed medical facility.

You should follow this format when drafting your proposals. Proposals in the incorrect format cannot be distributed.

#### Papers and Symposia

Academic conferences are opportunities to disseminate information you have gathered for your views. The method of presenting those ideas or that data, however, can vary a great deal.  The APA currently supports two kinds of presentations: Individual Reports and Symposia. The Program Committee (see below) is encouraged to experiment with new kinds of presentations, including posters, round tables, workshops, and even exhibits, if they choose. Individual Reports are talks given by a single researcher or group of researchers. Symposia are 'panel' presentations, where a group of presentations are offered on a theme or a specific problem.

The Program Committee reviews all proposals for both individual reports and symposia.  The guidelines for proposing a report are included in the official &lt;!--\fullref{callforpapersandsymposiua}--&gt;.

#### Research Grants

Research grants are 1-2 page proposals specifying a research project you'd like to carry out.  These are submitted to the Research committee (see p. 7) and follow the form specified in the Call for Research Grants', which follows on page 17. If you win a research grant, you will be expected to present your findings at the next annual conference.

#### Reading aloud

Presentations at academic conferences are evaluated by peers primarily on the basis of the content presented, not the style of presentation. While it is important to practice good public speaking skills-making eye contact with the audience, modulating one's voice, etc.—getting the data right is more important than being entertaining. For that reason, this game will allow 'reading' of some experimental reports.  Experimental reports highlight the data presented, and carefully articulate the structure of the experiment performed. It is also advisable to bring handouts for the membership when presenting data.

Presidential addresses, however, should be carefully crafted general lectures. These should appeal to the membership of the APA, which includes many individuals from a variety of backgrounds. They should also be understandable by the general public, as the President is often seen as a spokesperson and advocate for the discipline.

Symposia and presentations to the committees, however, must be delivered without a transcript. Cue cards or notes are allowed, but in these cases, the speaker must strive to make a personal connection with the audience, and hence, must not simply read a prepared speech.</Text>

            <Text>Game Play

Each week, or two sessions, of game play reenacts ones on conference of the APA in the 1970s.   The annual meeting of the APA is a huge event. There are presentations on current research, panel discussions of issues facing the discipline, administrative meetings for various committees, and publishers promoting their products.

The first session of each conference opens with a presidential address. Presidents are elected based on their reputation as researchers, but they also must have keen leadership skills and knowledge of policies and procedures of the organization's committee structure. Since these two areas of expertise do not always appear in the same person, the president is not elected directly by the membership. The membership holds an annual election for the vice-president, who is then promoted to president after a year of sitting on the executive committee and observing the inner workings of the political system.
 
The executive committee is composed of the APA President, the Vice president, and three members elected at large each serving three year terms, one expiring each year. The executive secretary, who serves without vote, is responsible for maintaining the minutes of the executive committee and taking whatever actions the committee approves during its meetings.

Events that happen at year's conference:
(1)	Executive committee meet in open session.
1.	All committees and task forces report
(2)	Executive committee meet in closed session, if necessary.
(3)	Open sessions for presenting current research.
(4)	Panel discussions on topics proposed by membership.
(5)	Election for vice president, who assumes that position at the close of that conference.
(6)	Election for member-at-large on the executive committee.
(7)	Closing remarks by current vice president, who assumes the role of president at the end of the conference.
Committee structure
The APA is overseen by an executive committee, which is responsible for maintaining the organization, and approving all official publications of the organization.  The president, who opens the conference with his or her presidential address, also serves as chair of the executive committee during that conference. The secretary of the executive committee is responsible for maintaing the minutes for that meeting and taking whatever actions are required. The membership of the executive committee is:

President
Chair of the executive committee, serving a 1-year term
Vice President – elected annually
Serves a 1-year term as Vice President, automatically promoted to President for the next year at the close of that year's annual conference
Executive secretary (preceptor), without vote

Committee member elected at large
Serving 3-year term.
Committee member elected at large
Serving 3-year term.
Committee member elected at large
Serving 3-year term.

Table 2: Terms for executive committee members
The executive committee is one of a handful of standing committees of the APA. Standing committees are permanent institutions, whose membership is elected by the membership at large. Ad Hoc (literally 'after the fact') committees are created by simple majority vote of the executive committee to generate a report on a specific problem or area of research. Usually, these are formed when the executive committee believes it has inadequate information on a specific subject. For the purposes of this game, ad hoc committees will conduct literature reviews on behalf of the executive committee. Ad hoc committees dissolve after the report is accepted by the executive committee.  

Task forces are created by the executive committee to complete a specific  task. When the executive committee creates a new task force, it gives that force a 'charge', which specifies and limits its responsibilities and powers. Like ad hoc committees, task forces disappear at the completion of their task – but unlike ad hoc committees, that task need not be the creation of a report.

The executive committee has the power to create ad hoc committees and task forces as it sees fit. The membership of those committees may be specified directly by the executive committee at the time of creation, left to the chair of the committee to decide, or even determined by popular vote of the membership.

The creation of new standing committees require a majority vote of the APA membership.

\begin{apatextbox}{Sample call for proposals for APA conference}  --&gt;

#### Call for Papers and Symposia
##### Introduction

 I.	The Program committee herein announces a Call of Papers and Symposia for the annual convention of the APA. Please read the relevant rules carefully if you plan to take part in the program. Note especially the deadlines, the form for abstracts of contributed papers, the forms for symposium proposals, and the proper persons to receive your correspondence. The pertinent references have been collected into the box on this page for your convenience.

This year will begin with a plenary address by the President. Current plans allow for 2 individual reports and 1 symposium.  The Board of Directors will meet in open session to hear proposals from the membership.
 #####Kinds of Programs and Sessions

The meetings regularly contain many kinds of programs and sessions, including research papers, symposia, group discussions, addresses, business meetings, and film sessions, as well as other events, such as reunions, dinners, social hours and the like. In general, requests for information should be submitted to the Program Committee.

The APA Program Committee has full responsibility for the conference program. Persons planning to submit proposals that fall outside the lines outlined herein should consult with the chairman of the APA Program Committee for special instructions.

The chairman of the APA Program Committee should also receive all requests for scheduling of nonsubstantive program activities such as reunions, dinners, social hours, headquarters space, luncheons, and the like. To insure publication in the program all requests must be received by the close of business on the Friday before a conference.
 ##### Who may participate

 ###### Volunteered Papers

 Any member of the APA may read a paper, provided that it has been accepted by the program committee.

 ###### A nonmember of the APA

may read a paper provided that he is sponsored by a member of the  APA and provided that his qualifications and the quality of his paper are acceptable to the program committee. The APA member who agrees to sponsor a nonmember must submit the abstract of the nonmember's paper to the chairman of the program committee with an accompanying description of the nonmember's scientific qualifications plus the names of recognized scientific societies in which the nonmember holds membership.

 ###### Symposia and invited addresses

The program committee may invite distinguished nonmembers to contribute to the program as special speakers or as participants in symposia. Because symposia often involve topics extending beyond the competence of APA members, it is frequently desirable to include nonmembers as participants.  Acceptance of a distinguished speaker or of a symposium proposal by the Program Committee constitutes the require sponsorship of nonmember participants.
 #####Limits of Individual Participation

Over the past several years the APA's Board of Directors working with the program committee has developed several ground rules for the limits of individual participation in the annual convention program. These rules were designed to ensure the widest possible participation by APA members and also to prevent troublesome conflicts in the time schedule. Briefly, the rules have been that each member may present no more than one volunteered paper and that each member may, in addition, participate in no more than one additional session such as a symposium, discussion group, and the like. It is still strongly recommended that maximum participation be limited to one symposium or discussion group plus one paper.

 #####Individual Reports

Unless otherwise indicated, four ten-minute papers will be scheduled for each 50-minute session. In instances of multiple authorship the person whose name is listed first will be expected to present the paper.

A paper previously read at the Annual APA Convention may not be read again, unless it is a substantial elaboration (additional findings, etc.). Two papers which report highly similar findings from a cooperative project may not be read at the convention.

The APA Board of Directors have voted that, for reasons of economy, this rule should be followed: Abstracts printed in the American Psychologist are limited to 100 words. However, it is recognized that more detailed information will be needed by the Program Committee for use in the selection of papers.  The procedures for research reports and other individual reports are described below.

 ######Research Reports

*Each author of a research report must submit a 100-word abstract (1 copy) for publication if the paper is accepted, and also a 300-word summary (4 copies) for committee publication.*  If the author desires, tables presenting results may be submitted with the 300-word summary. Not more than one page of tables should be submitted. This means that all the data should have been obtained and the analysis completed at the time the abstract and summary are submitted to the Program Committee.

 ######Other individual reports

Theoretical papers, case studies, and the like are perfectly acceptable for the program.  *The 100-word abstract of a non-experimental paper must, however, be accompanied by a manuscript of the complete paper in draft form.* The complete manuscript is required in order that the Program Committee may be in a better position to judge the contribution to the program.

 ######Form of abstracts and summaries

All abstracts and summaries must be typed on one side of the paper only, double-spaced throughout and on 8 1/2” X 11” paper.


*The 100-word abstract*

The purpose of the published abstract is to provide information concerning the psychological relevance of the paper. .. primarily to justify its scientific validity. Hence abstracts should be concerned with content … rather than with method and technique unless the purpose of the paper is essentially methodological). Examples of good short abstracts from many different fields may be found in *Psychological Abstracts*.

Abstracts must be limited in length to 100 words (not counting title, author and institution). Longer abstracts will not be printed but will be listed by title only. Abstracts should not contain tables, drawings, footnotes, or bibliographic entries, as such material will not be printed.

The following outline should be followed in preparing the abstract:

Title of Paper:
Author(s):				Sponsor (if any):
Institution(s):
     *Text of abstract* (not to exceed 100 words)

Because the 100-word abstract will be sent to the printer, do not underline or type anything with all capital letters. The type written abstract should be checked and proofread carefully, since it will be printed in the form in which it is submitted.  Authors are urged to give careful thought to the visual aides that will best facilitate presentations of their data.  If slides are used, members are urged to consider presenting graphic and tabular material on paper.  As a new procedure, authors of accepted papers will be asked to indicate their preference for audio-visual support.

*The 300-word summary*

The text of the summary will normally include a statement of the problem, subjects used, procedure, results and conclusions.

Summaries must be limited in length to 300 words (not counting title, author, and institution). The 300-word summary may be accompanied by not more than one page of supplementary tables, drawings, footnotes, etc.

The form for submitting the 300-word summary should be exactly the same as for the 100-word abstract except, of course, for the longer text.

Four copies of the 300-word summary and the supplementary tables, etc. are required. *Author, sponsor, and institution should appear on the first copy only.* The first copy is the one that will be used by the Program Committee Chair in the creation of the Conference Proceedings. The other three copies without identifying data will be used by the Program Committee for judging the acceptability of the paper.

###### Where to send abstracts and summaries

Copies of the abstract and summary of a volunteered paper should be sent to the chair of the Program Committee.

##### Symposia

A symposium provides for several prepared papers on a single theme or problem. It is an excellent form of meeting if the aim is to bring to an audience several diverse or even contradictory views, presented by a number of “experts.” The expectation would be that all papers would first be read; then there would be a substantial period for interchanging of views among the speakers (and invited discussants, if desired); finally, a brief period for questions or points raised from the floor. It is important to plan the time so that there is real interaction among participants after the papers. In order to realize the unique value of the symposium the chairman should select speakers at an early date, arrange for the participants to exchange papers ell in advance of the session, and ensure that ample time is allotted for discussion among the participants and contributors from the audience

###### Initiation of symposia

Any member of the APA may suggest a symposium topic to the chairman of the Program Committee. Such proposals must be made at an early date as a successful symposium requires much planning and correspondence. A member may also submit a fully organized symposium for the Program Committee's consideration.

 ###### Form of symposium proposals

*Suggestions to the Program Committee*

When a member only suggests but does not organize a symposium, he should indicate the title of the topic for discussion, comment on the significance of the topic, and list the names and addresses of the proposed chairman and other participants. Such suggestions should be sent to the appropriate divisional program chairman well in advance of the deadline to allow for ample time for planning.

*Member-Organized symposia*

A member may organize a proposed symposium in complete detail and present it for approval to the Program Committee. Each such proposal should indicate the title of the symposium and list the names of the chairman and participants, together with the titles of participants' contributions, if these titles are to be published. *Five copies of the completed symposium plans must be submitted to the Program Committee by the deadline.*

*Symposia organized by the Program Committee*

Symposia may be organized independently by the Program Committee or in response to the requests of members.

##### Special Programs
The Program Committee should feel free to try new kinds of programs.  Forums, discussion groups, panels, round tables, conferences, and workshops are often valuable alternatives to papers and symposia. Members are invited to send suggestions for new types of programs to the Program Committee. Special sessions should be suggested well in advance of the deadline to allow for ample time for planning. Procedures for initiating special programs should follow in general the procedures for initiating symposia.

##### Miscellaneous Meetings and Special Sessions

APA boards, committees, etc. desiring business meetings must send to the Chairman of the APA Program Committee by the deadline a statement of estimated attendance, time required, time and day preferred and whether arrangements for luncheon and dinner are desired.

Luncheons, dinners and social hours may be scheduled for non-APA organizations if they send their request to the chairman of the APA Program Committee by the deadline.  Such scheduled events will be listed in the condensed program.

##### Audio-Visual Presentations

APA members, commercial film producers or distributors who wish to present new films, film strips, or other audio-visual aids (including sound recordings) should make the Program Committee aware of this fact at the deadline.  The committee will review and select the audio-visual materials which are to be presented as part of the APA program.

##### Exhibits

APA members are encouraged to exhibit apparatus, teaching aids, and other materials of scientific and applied interest. Commercial agencies are invited to request arrangements for exhibits. All commercial exhibitors will be charged for space. Those wishing to arrange for exhibits must write to the chairman of the Program Committee.

#### Call for Research Grants

##### Introduction

The Research Committee of the APA herein solicits proposals for research that will forward the disciplines of psychology and psychiatry. Note especially the deadlines, the form for abstracts of contributed papers, the forms for symposium proposals, and the proper persons to receive your correspondence. The pertinent references have been collected into the box on this page for your convenience.

Winners will be granted the support of the other members of the class for a period of one class session. The primary investigator must specify in the research proposal how the other students will participate: as subjects, participants, observers or confederates.


Winning grants will be determined by the Research Committee, in accordance with the criteria specified herein.  All proposals must be in line with the APA's ethical guidelines which are in force at the time of submission.

##### Research Supported

The APA seeks to advance the creation, communication and application of knowledge of the mind and behavior to benefit society and improve people's lives. The APA embraces scientific inquiry into all aspects of the human experience — from the functions of the brain to the actions of nations, from child development to care for the aged. And in every conceivable setting from scientific research centers to mental health care services, "the understanding of behavior" is the enterprise of psychologists.

Additionally, the APA aspires to advance the understanding of psychology and psychiatry as scientific disciplines. To that end, it will support any research that follows the standards of scientific inquiry and contributes to the central goals of the association.

It is imperative that all research supported by the APA must be accordance with the ethical guidelines published by the APA.  

##### Who May Submit Proposals

###### Members of the APA

Any member of the APA may submit a proposal for a research grant.  APA membership is limited to those meeting the definition of 'Psychologist' or 'Psychiatrist' used by the APA (see p. 10 of the gamebook).

###### Nonmembers of the APA

As the APA Research committee seeks to further the disciplines of Psychology and Psychiatry wherever they are practiced, the primary investigator of a grant need ot be a member of the APA. The primary investigator, however, must be a Psychologist or Psychiatrist as defined by the APA (see p. 10 of the gamebook).

###### Confederates, Observers and Assistants

Individuals working in psychological research should be engaged in some significant way with the academic pursuit of knowledge. Confederates, observers and assistants in research must therefore be students of psychology or psychiatry, if not psychologists or psychiatrists in their own right.

##### Limitations of Participation

A primary investigator may submit one (1) proposal annually. An individual may serve as a consultant, confederate, observer or assistant on any number of grant proposals in addition to proposing himself as a primary investigator.   

##### Form of the Proposal

######Introduction

Limited to 100 words, the introduction should specify the phenomenon you wish to examine and why. Briefly describe the phenomenon in general, and discuss how it relates to the study of the human mind and behavior.

######Background / Review

Briefly describe the history of research into this phenomenon, and why that history is insufficient. Summarize what is already known about the phenomenon, including the background information you gleaned during your literature review.

######Rationale

Describe the questions you are examining and explore any possible implications of your study. This includes listing the specific questions you are addressing, explaining how your research is related to the larger issues raised in the introduction. Specifically describe the claims, models or hypotheses you will evaluate with your research. Explain how your research will contribute to our understanding of the mind.

######Method and Design

Describe how you will go about collecting data and testing the questions you wish to examine. While novel methods are encouraged, the primary investigator must be able to specify the scientific validity of any methods proposed.

Method: How will you collect the data?

  Describe the general methodology you choose for your study, i.e. observational, experimental, etc.
* Explain why this method is the best method for this question.
*  Specify who will participate in your study, and why.
*  Describe the sample you would test and explain why you have chosen this sample. Include age, and language background and socio-economic information, if relevant to the design.
*Are there any participants you would exclude? Why, why not?

Design
* Describe what kinds of manipulations/variations you would make or test for in order to test your hypothesis(es).
* Describe the factors you would vary if you were presenting a person with stimulus sentences.
* Explain how varying these factors would allow you to confirm or disconfirm your hypotheses.
* Explain what significant differences you would need to find to confirm or disconfirm your hypothesis(es). In particular, how could your hypothesis(es) be disconfirmed by your data?
* Controls: What kinds of factors would you need to control for in your study?
* Describe what types of effects would be likely to occur which would make your results appear to confirm, or to disconfirm your hypothesis(es).
* Describe how you can by your design rule out or control for apparent effects.

Procedure
* How are you going to present the stimuli?
* What is the participant in the experiment going to do?

Analysis
* How will you analyze the results?
* What kind of results would confirm your hypothesis?
* What kind of results would disconfirm your hypothesis

###### Significance and Contribution


###### References


###### Where to send your proposal

Three copies of the proposal should be sent to the chairman of the Research committee.

##### Reports

Research findings should be submitted to the conference committee for the annual national conference following the awarding of the grant. The primary investigator should follow the guidelines found under 'Research Reports' (see &lt;!--\ref{researchreports}--&gt; on page &lt;!--\pageref{researchreports}--&gt;) in drafting his research report. Winning a grant in no way guarantees inclusion in the following year's conference program.
