In reality there are two distinct associations named 'APA.' The American Psychiatric Association, which is composed of Medical Doctors who practice Psychiatry, maintains the DSM. The American Psychological Association, which is composed of academics (PhDs) who study the mind in a variety of ways, does not.  In this game, we have conflated these two distinct associations. If you are interested in studying these events in closer detail, most characters with MDs are members of the American Psychiatric Association, while characters with PhDs are members of the American Psychological Association. For the most part, events with which a character interacts occurred under the umbrella of their respective organizations.\
