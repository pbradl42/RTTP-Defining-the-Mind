<p class="binderItem"><strong>Brief overview of the game</strong><br/>### The Game<br/>
<br/>
This game highlights the intellectual conflicts that changed American psychiatry and psychology in the early part of the 1970s.<br/>
<br/>
 It might seem a little odd, in reacting game, to be exploring relatively recent events. While there will be no executions, ostracisms or civil wars in this game, the intellectual stakes are no less high. What you know of Psychiatry and Psychology today—the social significance of the APA's *Diagnostic and Statistical Manual *(DSM), the use of psychopharma...</p>

<br/>
Your cab pulls up in front of the Shoreham hotel  in Rock Creek Park, a particularly tranquil part of the chaos that is Washington D.C. You nervously check the entrance to the hotel. It's clear. This year, there are no throngs of protesters bent on face-to-face confrontation.<br/>
<br/>
They must be down at the mall participating in the massive protest calling for an end to the Vietnam war.  The radio reported an estimated crowd of at least 50,000. And that's before the 10,000 National Guard...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Counterfactuals</strong><br/>### Counterfactuals<br/>
<br/>
In reality there are two distinct associations named 'APA.' The American Psychiatric Association, which is composed of Medical Doctors who practice Psychiatry, maintains the DSM. The American Psychological Association, which is composed of academics (PhDs) who study the mind in a variety of ways, does not. <br/>
<br/>
In this game, I have conflated the two, which is significant transgression on both sides of the divide. <br/>

<br/>
The study of the mind can be traced back to the very foundations of Western civilization in Ancient Greece.  For the purposes of this game, we’re going to confine ourselves to the era of ‘scientific’ study of the mind, both in a medical and research context.  All historical events up until 1974 that are described in this game book are listed here in a round time line, for ease of reference.<br/>

<br/>
The scientific investigation into the human mind and/or human behavior begins almost simultaneously with science itself.  Our inquiry into its history must then begin with the followers of Francis Bacon, who created the ‘scientific method’ and trace the idea that the can be studied scientifically through the rise of the empiricists into the present day.<br/>

<br/>
While homosexual behavior has appeared throughout human history, the notion of homosexuality as an “orientation” or “personality” is relatively recent.  The etymology of the word 'homosexual' itself shows the intimate connection between the idea of sexual orientation and the history of psychiatry.  According to the OED, the term first appears in print in English in C. G. Chaddock translation of R. von Krafft-Ebing 1892 *Psychopathia S...</p>

All psychological theories hold that human action can be predicted based on previous actions of that human.  The way to make those predictions---and the underlying mechanisms posited that explain those actions---separates psychological theories from each other.<br/>
<br/>
When I say ‘mechanism’, I am using a very specific notion in the Philosophy of science.  A mechanism is an organization of underlying entities which interact with each other to create the phenomenon of inter...</p>

#### Basic game play<br/>
<br/>
Each week (two or three sessions, depending on your schedule) of game play reenacts one annual conference of the APA in the early 1970s. The five weeks of game play cover the years 1971-1975. In reality, these conferences are huge events. There are presentations on current research, symposia on issues facing the discipline, administrative meetings for various committees, public discussions and votes on proclamations, and publishers promoting their products.

Academic associations like the APA not only provide their members with a forum through which they can socialize, share ideas and test or their most recent work; they also represent their discipline to the public. An association's president is often called upon to act as a spokesperson during times of controversy. The associations often define---sometimes very carefully---the qualifications someone must have to become a member.<br/>

1. *Internal entities are neither the object of scientific study nor explanatorily relevant to psychology.* Behaviorism begins with the deceptively simply insight that while psychoanalytic explanations are framed in terms of psychic entities (ego, id, etc.), quantities (psychic energy) and interactions (the mechanisms of repression), w...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Game synopsis</strong><br/>The narrative of the game begins, but does not end with, the demedicalization of homosexuality. This game is not intended to be a political game wherein the players are centrally interested in the collection and use of power.  Rather, this game is meant to be about evidence, and the interpretation of evidence. Bieber claims, for example, to have about 30% success rate in his ‘treatment’ of homosexuality. Is this an adequate? Especially as the pain it causes--as experience first-hand by Ron Gold....</p>

1. **Demedicalization**<br/>
<br/>
The demedlication of homosexuality is almost totally assured.  The only characters who argue against it are Bieber and Socarides. Their reliance on psychoanalytic techniques will not sway Marmor or Hopcke, who are committed to demedicalization.  This may be frustrating to your students.  I...</p>

#### Learning Objectives<br/>
<br/>
In many ways, this is not a game about Psychology or Psychiatry, it is a game about the Philosophy of Science. This shouldn't really be surprising, as the history of the Psychology and Psychiatry is intimately linked to the history of the Philosophy of Science. Arguments made by Wundt, Freud, Watson, Hull Skinner and Miller all rely heavily on claims regarding what is or is not a legitimate scientific claim. This issues has not disappeared from undergr...</p>

<br/>
Many of the issues raised in the course of the game are appropriately philosophical.  While we've instructed the students to focus on the evidence, and its relationship with the claims asserted, one is often forced to notice how few of the great conflicts in the history of psychology and psychiatry are actually about the quality of the evidence presented. The conflicts are, most frequently, actually about whether the evidence in question can be considered 'scientific....</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Overview</strong><br/> While there is a great deal to prepare for this game, my experience has taught me that the largest challenge the students will face is understanding that psychology and psychiatry were not always as they are now presented.  <br/>
<br/>
Most students come to the game believing that (a) psychology is a science and (b) psychiatry is a medical practice.  Both of those claims were not settled in the public mind in 1970.  In fact, most of the tension in this game revolves around the efforts to make psychiatry ...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>Rules and Procedures</strong><br/><br/>
<br/>
Generally speaking, our students come to psychology and psychiatry through textbooks. And as a result, they are primed to believe, unreflectively, that contemporary narrative of these disciplines is settled fact. Furthermore, these students know nothing of the rise and regularization of health insurance companies and billing procedures following the inception of Medicare and Medicaid in 1965. For them, managed care, billable hours and check-box diagnoses have always been a part of their medica...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Voting</strong><br/>#### Possible Mod: Voting<br/>
<br/>
I've left the issue of membership in the APA, and the right to vote on many of the main issues, intentionally vague. This is to allow for some flexibility for the instructor. The issue of who can practice mental health treatment is a game issue, realized in competing proposals in 1973.  As a corollary then, the issue of membership in the APA may be brought forward. This can also play out as one of the causes of the APA’s ‘fission' that may occur starting in 1975.<br/>

#### Emotional responses in a human child.<br/>
<br/>
##### Background: <br/>
<br/>
Many psychologists--Freud included--have held, with little evidence in support, that the human mind is built on a variety of instincts, such as self-preservation, sexual activity, etc. Emotional responses to fearful stimuli, such as rats and spiders, is commonly considered to be innate, possibly as a result of evolutionary pressures to avoid infectious or poisonous creatures.  This experiment seeks to condition a fea...</p>

#### Mental rotation of three-dimensional objects<br/>
<br/>
##### Background: <br/>
<br/>
Mentally rotating 3-dimensional objects is one indicator of spatial reasoning in humans. And it is one that is tempting to explain in terms of internal mental imagery. The 'cognitive hypothesis' holds that in order to solve mental rotation problems, a cognitive representation of the presented object must be rotated in the mind before an identification can be made - and it is that hypothesis that we wish to tes...</p>

##### Background<br/>
<br/>
However much mental health practitioners may be personally convinced that we can tell the normal from the abnormal, the evidence is simply not compelling. It is commonplace, for example, to read about murder trials wherein eminent psychiatrists for the defense are contradicted by equally eminent psychiatrists for the prosecution on the matter of the defendant's sanity. More generally, there are a great deal of conflicting dat...</p>

#### Adjustment of Homosexual and Heterosexual Women<br/>
<br/>
Background The traditional psychiatric belief that homosexual men are emotionally unstable has recently been challenged by Evelyn Hooker's study of non-prisoner non-patient homosexual men.  There have been a few similar studies on women.  The contention that homosexual women are neurotic has typically been voiced by clinicians reporting on their own patients. One exception is the recent psychometric investigation by Kenyon (19...</p>

#### A Re-analysis of the Reliability of Psychiatric Diagnosis<br/>

<br/>
Classification systems such as diagnosis have two primary properties, reliability and validity. Reliability refers to the consistency with which subjects are classified; validity, to the utility of the system for its various purposes. In the case of psychiatric diagnosis, the purposes of the classification system are communication about clinical features, aetiology, course of illness and treatment...</p>
