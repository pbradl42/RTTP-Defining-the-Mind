abstract = {First published in 1959, Authority, Responsibility and Education focuses on the philosophy of education and is concerned with the question of moral education. It was originally based on talks delivered mainly on the Home Service and Third Programme of the BBC between April 1956 and January 1959 but, due to its wide appeal and popularity, it was revised to include work from a further 10 years of the author{\textquoteright}s teaching and experience in the subject. The book is written in three parts on authority, responsibility, and education, and uses several theories, including those by Marx and Freud, to achieve his aims. Although originally published some time ago, the book considers many questions that are still relevant to us today.},

abstract = {Reproducibility is a defining feature of science, but the extent to which it characterizes current research is unknown. We conducted replications of 100 experimental and correlational studies published in three psychology journals using high-powered designs and original materials when available. Replication effects were half the magnitude of original effects, representing a substantial decline. Ninety-seven percent of original studies had statistically significant results. Thirty-six percent of replications had statistically significant results; 47% of original effect sizes were in the 95% confidence interval of the replication effect size; 39% of effects were subjectively rated to have replicated the original result; and if no bias in original results is assumed, combining original and replication results left 68% with statistically significant effects. Correlational tests suggest that replication success was better predicted by the strength of original evidence than by characteristics of the original and replication teams.},

abstract = {With a New Preface Written in 2016 by Adam Nagourney This is the definitive account of the last great struggle for equal rights in the twentieth century. From the birth of the modern gay rights movement in 1969, at the Stonewall riots in New York, through 1988, when the gay rights movement was eclipsed by the more urgent demands of AIDS activists, this is the remarkable and until now untold story of how a largely invisible population of men and women banded together to create their place in America{\textquoteright}s culture and government. Told through the voices of gay activists and their opponents, filled with dozens of colorful characters, Out for Good traces the emergence of gay rights movements in cities across the country and their transformation into a national force that changed the face of America forever. Out for Good is the unforgettable chronicle of an important{\textemdash}and nearly lost{\textemdash}chapter in American history.},

abstract = {Replies to the comments of Karson, Baler, and Carroll (see record 2005-12006-001) suggesting that the planning of the program of research reported in America's Psychologists (see record 2004-15427-000) intentionally or unintentionally was influenced by value judgments. What they mean to say is that they believe the wrong values were assigned, especially in the study of factors influencing an individual psychologist's research contributions to psychology. The emphasis given to research publication, to which Karson, Baler, and Carroll object, occurred in our study of the way in which significant contributors differed from their less productive colleagues. Attention to publication was essential, we felt, since any contribution to science necessarily involves comunication with one's fellows about results. America's Psychologists did give consideration to other professional endeavors. I think we need to recognize that all of American psychology is today perplexed about the relative values to assign to research and to service in our growing field. Karson, Baler, and Carroll protest that decisions are being made about the desired characteristics of a clinical psychologist on traditional bases without enough attention being given to changing conditions and new roles played by clinical psychologists. For this position I think they can find full and unqualified support in America's Psychologists. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2010 APA, all rights reserved)

Consideration of the cost of viable alternatives includes 4 possible courses: (a) perpetuation of the Boulder model, (b) development of separate professional schools of psychology, (c) effecting a new liaison with another major profession, and (d) abandonment of clinical psychology as a separate field. Because of the difficulties in financing professional training, and the impending increased demand for teachers of psychology, it is concluded that clinical psychology, as it has developed, may decline in strength and importance for the next few years.

abstract = {After determining one set of skills that we hoped our students were learning in the introductory philosophy class at Carnegie Mellon University, we designed an experiment, performed twice over the course of two semesters, to test whether they were actually learning these skills. In addition, there were four different lectures of this course in the Spring of 2004, and five in the Fall of 2004; and the students of Lecturer 1 (in both semesters) were taught the material using argument diagrams as a tool to aid understanding and critical evaluation, while the other students were taught using more traditional methods. We were interested in whether this tool would help the students develop the skills we hoped they would master in this course. In each lecture, the students were given a pre-test at the beginning of the semester, and a structurally identical post-test at the end. We determined that the students did develop the skills in which we were interested over the course of the semester. We also determined that the students who were able to construct argument diagrams gained significantly more than the other students. We conclude that learning how to construct argument diagrams significantly improves a student{\textquoteright}s ability to analyze, comprehend, and evaluate arguments. },

In this book Pestalozzi speaks about his thoughts regarding mankind and humanity, the individual, home, the education of man, poverty, justice and liberty, truth and wisdom as well as nature, the World and God. An example, "He who bears the interests of humanity in his breast, that man is blessed." Swiss educational reformer. Between 1805 and 1825 he directed the Yverdon Institute (near Neuch{\~A}{\textcent}tel), which drew pupils and educators (including Friedrich Froebel) from all over Europe. His teaching method emphasized group rather than individual recitation and focused on such participatory activities as drawing, writing, singing, physical exercise, model making, collecting, mapmaking, and field trips. Among his ideas, considered radically innovative at the time, were making allowances for individual differences, grouping students by ability rather than age, and encouraging formal teacher training.},

abstract = {Discusses the necessity of using a multidisciplinary approach to social problems and psychology's distinctive contribution through the scientific explanation of human behavior. The psychologist is obligated to differentiate between his personal values or beliefs and the assertions deriving from psychological science. Psychotechnology is needed to provide mediating links between basic research and practical problems. Psychology can also contribute to solving social problems through cultural diffusion of well-established psychological knowledge, illustrated by such broad, orienting concepts as interaction of variables, overlapping of group ranges, multidimensionality of individual differences, and modifiability of behavior. Social problems can be most effectively solved by encouraging diversity of approaches through different disciplines as well as within psychology. In society at large, the cultivation of diversity enriches the culture and protects the individual against undue control from any 1 source. (84 ref.)

abstract = {Racial disparities in health are well-documented and represent a significant public health concern in the US. Racism-related factors contribute to poorer health and higher mortality rates among Blacks compared to other racial groups. However, methods to measure racism and monitor its associations with health at the population-level have remained elusive. In this study, we investigated the utility of a previously developed Internet search-based proxy of area racism as a predictor of Black mortality rates. Area racism was the proportion of Google searches containing the {\textquotedblleft}N-word{\textquotedblright} in 196 designated market areas (DMAs). Negative binomial regression models were specified taking into account individual age, sex, year of death, and Census region and adjusted to the 2000 US standard population to examine the association between area racism and Black mortality rates, which were derived from death certificates and mid-year population counts collated by the National Center for Health Statistics (2004{\textendash}2009). DMAs characterized by a one standard deviation greater level of area racism were associated with an 8.2% increase in the all-cause Black mortality rate, equivalent to over 30,000 deaths annually. The magnitude of this effect was attenuated to 5.7% after adjustment for DMA-level demographic and Black socioeconomic covariates. A model controlling for the White mortality rate was used to further adjust for unmeasured confounders that influence mortality overall in a geographic area, and to examine Black-White disparities in the mortality rate. Area racism remained significantly associated with the all-cause Black mortality rate (mortality rate ratio = 1.036; 95% confidence interval = 1.015, 1.057; p = 0.001). Models further examining cause-specific Black mortality rates revealed significant associations with heart disease, cancer, and stroke. These findings are congruent with studies documenting the deleterious impact of racism on health among Blacks. Our study contributes to evidence that racism shapes patterns in mortality and generates racial disparities in health.},

Ennis argues that Harman's notion of what is to be explained (i.e. 'All A's are B's; the next A will be B; s, as an instance of A, is B') fails to distinguish between cases where A and B are the result of some other factor C, or A causes something to be B.},

abstract = {Arbitrarily selected individuals (N=296) in Nebraska and Boston are asked to generate acquaintance chains to a target person in Massachusetts, employing "the small world method" (Milgram, 1967). Sixty-four chains reach the target person. Within this group the mean number of intermediaries between starters and targets is 5.2. Boston starting chains reach the target person with fewer intermediaries than those starting in Nebraska; subpopulations in the Nebraska group do not differ among themselves. The funneling of chains through sociometric "stars" is noted, with 48 per cent of the chains passing through three persons before reaching the target. Applications of the method to studies of large scale social structure are discussed.},

For arts and what then had some connection with what we now know as science, as incorporated in the traditional seven liberal arts of grammar, logic and rhetoric, followed by arithmetic, geometry, music and astronomy, were thought of as merely propaedeutic to the study of theology, law and medicine. Those seven liberal arts occupied the student during the course for the B.A., which gave the licence to teach, and some students went no further than that. But the main concern of a university lay in what happened after the B.A., in the attainment of a mastership or in what was in effect the doctorate in one of the three areas which I have mentioned before. Indeed, in some universities, particularly those in the south of Europe, the B.A. was given only scant attention and only lip service was given to the idea of liberal arts.</p></div>},

Born to survivalists in the mountains of Idaho, she prepared for the end of the world by stockpiling home-canned peaches and sleeping with her {\textquotedblleft}head-for-the-hills{\textquotedblright} bag. In the summer she stewed herbs for her mother, a midwife and healer, and in the winter she salvaged metal in her father{\textquoteright}s junkyard. Her father distrusted the medical establishment, so Tara never saw a doctor or nurse. Gashes and concussions, even burns from explosions, were all treated at home with herbalism. The family was so isolated from mainstream society that there was no one to ensure the children received an education, and no one to intervene when an older brother became violent. When another brother got himself into college and came back with news of the world beyond the mountain, Tara decided to try a new kind of life. She taught herself enough mathematics, grammar, and science to take the ACT and was admitted to Brigham Young University. There, she studied psychology, politics, philosophy, and history, learning for the first time about pivotal world events like the Holocaust and the Civil Rights Movement. Her quest for knowledge transformed her, taking her over oceans and across continents, to Harvard and to Cambridge University. Only then would she wonder if she{\textquoteright}d traveled too far, if there was still a way home. Educated is an account of the struggle for self-invention. It is a tale of fierce family loyalty, and of the grief that comes from severing one{\textquoteright}s closest ties. With the acute insight that distinguishes all great writers, Westover has crafted a universal coming-of-age story that gets to the heart of what an education is and what it offers: the perspective to see one{\textquoteright}s life through new eyes, and the will to change it.},

To be most useful, social psychology must develop a framework for viewing the present scene which will "go beyond explanations of specific phenomena, and provide a schema within which a range of events can be organized and understood." Major topics considered are: Attitude Changes Following Intergroup Contact. Public Position-Taking on Consequential Issues. Will the Needed Research be Done? It is felt that "we understand the events of this dramatic period in American history well enough to be able to conceive a fruitful research attack upon their meaning for social relations in general."

The past and future place within psychology of 2 historic streams of method, thought, and affiliation--experimental psychology and correlational psychology--is discussed in this address of the President at the 65th annual convention of the APA. "The well-known virtue of the experimental method is that it brings situational variables under tight control{\dag}.{\dag}.{\dag}. . The correlation method, for its part, can study what man has not learned to control or can never hope to control{\dag}.{\dag}.{\dag}. . A true federation of the disciplines is required. Kept independent, they can give only wrong answers or no answers at all regarding certain important problems{\dag}.{\dag}.{\dag}. . Correlational psychology studies only variance among organisms; experimental psychology studies only variance among treatments. A united discipline will study both of these, but it will also be concerned with the otherwise neglected interactions between organismic and treatment variables. Our job is to invent constructs and to form a network of laws which permits prediction." (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2008 APA, all rights reserve},

abstract = {The construct of values is central to many fields in the social sciences and humanities. The last two decades have seen a growing body of psychological research that investigates the content, structure and consequences of personal values in many cultures. Taking a cross-cultural perspective we review, organize and integrate research on personal values, and point to some of the main findings that this research has yielded. Personal values are subjective in nature, and reflect what people think and state about themselves. Consequently, both researchers and laymen sometimes question the usefulness of personal values in influencing action. Yet, self-reported values predict a large variety of attitudes, preferences and overt behaviours. Individuals act in ways that allow them to express their important values and attain the goals underlying them. Thus, understanding personal values means understanding human behaviour. Sagiv et al. review two decades of research into personal values. Although subjective in nature, self-reported values predict a large array of attitudes and preferences. As such, they provide invaluable insight into human behaviour.},

abstract = {Infant monkeys were reared with the aid of a laboratory constructed mother-substitute. "We produced a perfectly proportioned streamlined body stripped of unnecessary bulges and appendices. Redundancy in the surrogate mother's system was avoided by reducing the number of breasts from two to one and placing this unibreast in an upper-thoracic, sagittal position, thus maximizing the natural and known perceptual-motor capabilities of the infant operator. The surrogate was made from a block of wood, covered with sponge rubber, and sheathed in tan cotton terry cloth. A light bulb behind her radiated heat. The result was a mother, soft, warm, and tender, a mother with infinite patience, a mother available twenty-four hours a day, a mother that never scolded her infant and never struck or bit her baby in anger." The data obtained "make it obvious that contact comfort is a variable of overwhelming importance in the development of affectional responses, whereas lactation is a variable of negligible importance." It is suggested that the primary function of nursing "is that of insuring frequent and intimate body contact of infant with mother." (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2008 APA, all rights reserve},

abstract = {we know very little about mental health practitioners' views on treatments to change sexual orientation. Our aim was to survey a representative sample of professional members of the main United Kingdom psychotherapy and psychiatric organisations about their views and practices concerning such treatments. We sent postal questions to mental health professionals who were members of British Psychological Society, the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy, the United Kingdom Council for Psychotherapy and the Royal College of Psychiatrists. Participants were asked to give their views about treatments to change homosexual desires and describe up to five patients each, whom they has treated in this way. Of 1848 practitioners contacted, 1406 questionnaires were returned and 1328 could be analysed. Although only 55 (4%) of therapists reported that they would attempt to change a client's sexual orientation if one consulted asking for such therapy, 222 (17%) reported having assisted at least one client/patient to reduce or change his or her homosexual or lesbian feelings. 413 patients were described by these 222 therapists: 213 (52%) were seen in private practice and 117 (28%) were not followed up beyond the period of treatment. Counselling was the commonest (66%) treatment offered and there was no sign of a decline in treatments in recent years. 159 (72%) of the 222 therapists who had provided such treatment considered that a service should be available for people who want to change their sexual orientation. Client/patient distress and client/patient autonomy were seen as reasons for intervention; therapists paid attention to religious, cultural and moral values causing internal conflict. A significant minority of mental health professionals are attempting to help lesbian, gay and bisexual clients to become heterosexual. Given lack of evidence for the efficacy of such treatments, this is likely to be unwise or even harmful.},

abstract = {<p><b>Background:</b> Long term studies of cognitive development and colic have not differentiated between typical colic and prolonged crying.</p><p><b>Objective:</b> To evaluate whether colic and excessive crying that persists beyond 3 months is associated with adverse cognitive development.</p><p><b>Design:</b> Prospective cohort study. A sample of 561 women was enrolled in the second trimester of pregnancy. Colic and prolonged crying were based on crying behaviour assessed at 6 and 13 weeks. Children{\textquoteright}s intelligence, motor abilities, and behaviour were measured at 5 years (n = 327). Known risk factors for cognitive impairment were ascertained prenatally, after birth, at 6 and 13 weeks, at 6, 9, and 13 months, and at 5 years of age.</p><p><b>Results:</b> Children with prolonged crying (but not those with colic only) had an adjusted mean IQ that was 9 points lower than the control group. Their performance and verbal IQ scores were 9.2 and 6.7 points lower than the control group, respectively. The prolonged crying group also had significantly poorer fine motor abilities compared with the control group. Colic had no effect on cognitive development.</p><p><b>Conclusions:</b> Excessive, uncontrolled crying that persists beyond 3 months of age in infants without other signs of neurological damage may be a marker for cognitive deficits during childhood. Such infants need to be examined and followed up more intensively.</p>},

Two major problems relating to higher education are: (1) That many bright young people do not receive the training for which they are intellectually competent, and (2) That because of heightened birth rate beginning in the 1940's, a substantial rise in college enrollments can be expected within the next decade. The demand for trained personnel in the field of mental health is considered. Separate sections titled "Psychiatrists," "Psychologists," and "Social Workers" discuss the supply of and need for professional workers within each field. 50-item bibliography.

abstract = {Awakenings--which inspired the major motion picture--is the remarkable story of a group of patients who contracted sleeping-sickness during the great epidemic just after World War I. Frozen for decades in a trance-like state, these men and women were given up as hopeless until 1969, when Dr. Oliver Sacks gave them the then-new drug L-DOPA, which had an astonishing, explosive, "awakening" effect. Dr. Sacks recounts the moving case histories of his patients, their lives, and the extraordinary transformations which went with their reintroduction to a changed world.},

abstract = {"This encyclopedia, magnificently edited by Byron Kaldis, will become a valuable source both of reference and inspiration for all those who are interested in the interrelation between philosophy and the many facets of the social sciences. A must read for every student of the humanities."--Wulf Gaertner, University of Osnabrueck, Germany "Byron Kaldis' Encyclopedia of Philosophy and the Social Sciences is a triumph. The entries are consistently good, the coverage is amazing, and he has managed to involve the whole scholarly community in this field. It shows off the field very well, and will be a magnificent resource for students and others." -- Stephen Turner, USF, USA {\quotesinglbase}{\"A}{\'u} Like all good works of reference this Encyclopedia of Philosophy and the Social Sciences is not to be treated passively: it provides clear and sometimes controversial material for constructive confrontation. It is a rich resource for critical engagement. The Encyclopedia conceived and edited by Byron Kaldis is a work of impressive scope and I am delighted to have it on my bookshelf.{\quotesinglbase}{\"A}{\`u}-- David Bloor, Edinburgh, UK "This splendid and possibly unique work steers a skilful course between narrower conceptions of philosophy and the social sciences. It will be an invaluable resource for students and researchers in either or both fields, and to anyone working on the interrelations between them." -- William Outhwaite, Newcastle, UK "A work of vast scope and widely gathered expertise, the Encyclopedia of Philosophy and the Social Sciences is a splendid resource for anyone interested in the interface between philosophy and the social sciences." --Nicholas Rescher, Pittsburgh This encyclopedia is the first of its kind in bringing together philosophy and the social sciences. It is not only about the philosophy of the social sciences but, going beyond that, it is also about the relationship between philosophy and the social sciences. The subject of this encyclopedia is purposefully multi- and inter-disciplinary. Knowledge boundaries are both delineated and crossed over. The goal is to convey a clear sense of how philosophy looks at the social sciences and to mark out a detailed picture of how the two are interrelated: interwoven at certain times but also differentiated and contrasted at others. The Entries cover topics of central significance but also those that are both controversial and on the cutting-edge, underlining the unique mark of this Encyclopedia: the interrelationship between philosophy and the social sciences, especially as it is found in fresh ideas and unprecedented hybrid disciplinary areas. The Encyclopedia serves a further dual purpose: it contributes to the renewal of the philosophy of the social sciences and helps to promote novel modes of thinking about some of its classic problems. {\quotesinglbase}{\"A}{\'u}The Encyclopedia of Philosophy and the Social Sciences edited by Byron Kaldis, provides a unique, needed, and invaluable resource for researchers at every level. Unique because nothing else offers the breadth of coverage found in this work; needed because it permits researchers to find longer but also relatively brief, clear, but nonetheless expert articles introducing important topics; and invaluable because of the guidance offered to both related topics and further study. It should be the place that any interested person looks first when seeking to learn about philosophy and the social sciences.{\quotesinglbase}{\"A}{\`u} Paul Roth, UC Santa Cruz, USA {\quotesinglbase}{\"A}{\'u}The Encyclopedia of Philosophy and the Social Sciences edited by Byron Kaldis covers an enormous range of topics in philosophy and the social sciences and the entries are compact overviews of the essential issues{\quotesinglbase}{\"A}{\`u} Harold Kincaid, University of Alabama at Birmingham, USA},

Argues that CT is emphasizes level 'C' (reasoning), not 'D' (dialectic) 'reasoning' is 'putting together', 'counting' 'information processing' while 'thinking' is 'pondering' 'feeling' and 'reflection': "Reasoning is bent on measuring; thinking is a quest for meaning."
The then advances (1) thinking is non-utilitarian (Arendt / Hiedegger inspired) (2) Socrates is an ideal thinker (3) thinking is always 'out of order'. (4)Thinking is inherently 'critical' (5) thinking is dialectical (6) thinking abhors contradiction [intersects with reasoning] (7) thinking is the aspiration of eros (8) thinking is not 'strong sense CT' 
The further claim is that teaching reasoning does not make people better (thinkers  / moral): (1) the consideration is with the process, or activity, rather than the objects of thing (2) it is a need expressed in terms of eros. (3) thinking is 'wholeness'. (4) thinking is 'thanking' 
Crazy generalization of causal claim on pg 207 - rise in CT movement because of rise of japanese technological superiority

Only thing that looks like a conclusion is that the virtue of thinking needs practica - 'igniting the kind of meaning-wonderment, contemplation and self-transcendence described above is exceedingly difficulty. '},

System 1 is fast, intuitive, and emotional; System 2 is slower, more deliberative, and more logical. The impact of overconfidence on corporate strategies, the difficulties of predicting what will make us happy in the future, the profound effect of cognitive biases on everything from playing the stock market to planning our next vacation{\textemdash}each of these can be understood only by knowing how the two systems shape our judgments and decisions. Engaging the reader in a lively conversation about how we think, Kahneman reveals where we can and cannot trust our intuitions and how we can tap into the benefits of slow thinking. He offers practical and enlightening insights into how choices are made in both our business and our personal lives{\textemdash}and how we can use different techniques to guard against the mental glitches that often get us into trouble. Winner of the National Academy of Sciences Best Book Award and the Los Angeles Times Book Prize and selected by The New York Times Book Review as one of the ten best books of 2011, Thinking, Fast and Slow is destined to be a classic.},

This effort to redeem ad hominems requires an analysis of character that explains why and how character is relevant. I argue that virtue epistemology supplies this analysis. Three sorts of ad hominems that attack the speaker{\textquoteright}s intellectual character are legitimate. They attack a speaker{\textquoteright}s: (1) possession of reliabilist vices; or (2) possession of responsibilist vices; or (3) failure to perform intellectually virtuous acts. Legitimate ad hominems conclude that we should not believe what a speaker says solely on her say-so. },

Many familiar forms, including bivariate plots, statistical maps, bar charts, and coordinate paper, were used in the 18th century. Statistical graphics developed through attention to four problems: spatial organization (17th and 18th centuries), discrete comparison (18th and early 19th centuries), continuous distribution (19th century), and multivariate distribution and correlation (late 19th and early 20th centuries). Today, statistical graphics appear to be reemerging as an important analytic tool, with recent innovations exploiting computer graphics and related technologies.},

In demonstrating this fact, he brings to life the institutions, instruction, professors, and students of the Middle Ages.},

One subject spent 70 hours learning lists and relearning them after 20 min, 1 hour, 9 hours, 1 day, 2 days, or 31 days. The results are similar to Ebbinghaus' original data. We analyze the effects of serial position on forgetting and investigate what mathematical equations present a good fit to the Ebbinghaus forgetting curve and its replications. We conclude that the Ebbinghaus forgetting curve has indeed been replicated and that it is not completely smooth but most probably shows a jump upwards starting at the 24 hour data point.},

Home economics, trade training and commercial education {\^a} the three key areas of vocational training available to young women during the progressive era {\^a} are the focus of this work. Beginning with a study of the "woman question", or what women were supposed to be, the book traces the three curriculum areas from prescription, through lively discussions of policy to the actual programs and student responses to the programs. The author tells the story of education for work from several different perspectives and draws on a vast array of sources to paint this broad canvas of vocational education for young women at the turn of the twentieth century.},

Exploring the multi-layered roles of science and medicine in constructions of sexual difference in these debates, the book also pays attention to the variety of ways in which contemporary feminists negotiated and reconstituted conceptions of the female mind and its relationship to the body. While recognising similarities, Rowold shows how in each country the higher education debates and the underlying conceptions of women{\textquoteright}s nature were shaped by distinct historical contexts.},

abstract = {This qualitative research studied the phenomenon of parental involvement in the college transition process and sought to understand if students perceived they were affected, relative to the development of independence and autonomy, by the amount of parental involvement they experienced during this transition. Six traditional college freshmen were interviewed and asked about their relationships with their parents, their parent{\textquoteright}s involvement during the college search, application, and transition process, and how they perceived this involvement affected their development of independence and autonomy.
This study explored the effects of parental involvement as students transitioned from high school to college. The study looked at levels and impacts of parental involvement during high school through the college application process through the students' freshman year of college. Specifically, this research explored how students perceived parental involvement influenced their abilities to transition into the college environment and develop independence and autonomy. The research added to literature in the field by investigating the impact of parental involvement on the college transition process and exploring how involvement may affect the {\textquotedblleft}moving in{\textquotedblright} phase of this transition. By looking at student-parent relationships and parental involvement, student affairs professionals can gain insight as to how to provide programs and services to support students and their parents as they transition through these developmental stages.
This study added to previous research on how students perceive parental involvement affects students{\textquoteright} transition to college. Theories from Chickering and Reisser as well as Schlossberg were applied to help analyze the findings of the study related to how students experienced the transition from high school to college to better understand the development of independence and autonomy. Each of the six participants in this study expressed that they had parental support. Because of this support, these students were able to transition easier into college and were more comfortable taking risks, meeting new people, and experiencing a new environment.

This tacit understanding could be made explicit, and part of it is that there was nothing unusual which was left unmentioned (such as the large hole in the barn through which light falls on the robin. When we don't leave such a lot up to tacit understanding and imagination, we sa that we have constructed a model. (218)},

The term "symbiosis" describes a type of social relationship that is biotic rather than cultural. This biotic social order comes into existence and is maintained by competition. In plant and animal societies competition is unrestricted by an institutional or moral order. Human society is a consequence and effect of this limitation of the symbiotic social order by the cultural. Different social sciences are concerned with the forms which this limitation of the natural or ecological social order assumes on (1) the economic, (2) the political, and (3) the moral level.},

abstract = {The first book by the creator of COURSERA{\^A}{\textregistered}'s most popular online course in 2015, "A Life of Happiness and Fulfillment" Could the same traits that drive your career success also be keeping you from being happier? Fifteen years after getting his MBA, Raj Raghunathan spent some time with his old classmates. He noticed that though they{\^a}d all done well, there didn{\^a}t appear to be much correlation between their academic success and career success. What Raj found even more curious was the even smaller correlation between career success and what he calls life success. The greater the career success, the more unhappy, out of shape, harried and distracted his friends were. If intelligence helps with decision-making, smart people should naturally make better life choices. So why are so many of the smartest, brightest, most successful people profoundly unhappy? Raj set out to find an answer to this problem, and extensively researched happiness not just of students and business people, but also stay-at-home-parents, lawyers, and artists, among others. If You{\^a}re So Smart, Why Aren{\^a}t You Happy? takes readers on a fun and meaningful tour of the best research available on how some of the very determinants of success may also come to deflate happiness. Raghunathan explores the seven most common inclinations that successful people need to overcome, and the seven habits they should adopt instead. Among his surprising findings... {\^A}{\textperiodcentered}The correlation between wealth and happiness is much smaller than you'd expect it to be {\^A}{\textperiodcentered}Generosity is not only a key to happiness, but a determining factor of long term success {\^A}{\textperiodcentered}Appreciating uncertainty, rather than seeking full control of outcomes, is necessary for happiness If You{\^a}re So Smart, Why Aren{\^a}t You Happy? will give you a powerful new perspective on your work, personal goals and relationships, whether you{\^a}re already successful or just starting out.

Harlow's research career, spanning a full half century, was notable for its single-minded adherence to the search for understanding of a single species, for the imaginative methods he devised for the study of both cognition and motivation, and for the crucially important findings these methods provided. His careful empirical development of the facts of behavioral development led to prepositional generalizations that have contributed notably to an understanding of human as well as monkey motivational development.

abstract = {In the years immediately following the Civil War--the formative years for an emerging society of freed African Americans in Mississippi--there was much debate over the general purpose of black schools and who would control them. From Cotton Field to Schoolhouse is the first comprehensive examination of Mississippi's politics and policies of postwar racial education. The primary debate centered on whether schools for African Americans (mostly freedpeople) should seek to develop blacks as citizens, train them to be free but subordinate laborers, or produce some other outcome. African Americans envisioned schools established by and for themselves as a primary means of achieving independence, equality, political empowerment, and some degree of social and economic mobility--in essence, full citizenship. Most northerners assisting freedpeople regarded such expectations as unrealistic and expected African Americans to labor under contract for those who had previously enslaved them and their families. Meanwhile, many white Mississippians objected to any educational opportunities for the former slaves. Christopher Span finds that newly freed slaves made heroic efforts to participate in their own education, but too often the schooling was used to control and redirect the aspirations of the newly freed.},

The negative, animalistic characteristics of man must be subordinated to the positive values of love and empathy without sacrificing creativity or selective capacities. It is proposed that a program of direct biochemical intervention be implemented to control negativistic tendencies, with compulsive criminals as pretest Ss. Ultimately, world leaders who have the nuclear power to determine the fate of humanity should be given the earliest perfected form of appropriate drugs. This requirement would control the barbaric use of power and insure that survival of the human species is not sacrificed to the personal ego pathos of powerful individuals.

abstract = {Discusses major changes which have recently occurred in 3 areas of psychology and their implications for psychologists. In research psychology a far-reaching new ethical code has been adopted; in clinical-professional psychology the community specialty has arisen; and in measurement there has been a shift away from selection as an objective and toward classification and self-knowledge. The effect of these changes is to make psychologists less of an elite group set apart by special knowledge. Instead they are expected to work with nonpsychologists toward common objectives. The shift makes it advisable for psychologists to rethink some of their practices and attitudes. Researchers should devote more thought and attention to the initial choice of research problems and to plans for communication of findings to nonpsychologists. A similarly increased emphasis on choosing and planning is called for in professional service and teaching. It is suggested that it is time for psychologists to reexamine their assumptions and beliefs about determinism in light of current philosophical analyses and scientific developments.

abstract = {Descartes Discourse on Method has long been regarded as a seminal contribution to modern philosophy. We can now see that it is also one of the key texts in the 'scientific revolution' of the seventeenth century. Ren{\'e} Descartes (1596-1650) did major research in optics, geometry, astronomy and physiology, although (partly because Galileo had just been condemned by the Inquisition) he published nothing until he was over forty. The Discourse forms the preface to his first collection of scientific papers (1637), sketching in a new method based on hypothesis and deduction which was soon to replace traditional techniques derived from Aristotle. This edition puts the work in context, by including extracts from Descartes' correspondence, the Rules for Guiding One's Intelligence and from The World - a posthumously published summary of his physical theories, which at one point in its chequered life had to be rescued from the river Seine. The age of Newton marks one of the great turning points in intellectual history;},

abstract = {"O woman, woman! upon you I call; for upon your exertions almost entirely depends whether the rising generation shall be any thing more than we have been or not. O woman, woman! your example is powerful, your influence great."{\^a}Maria W. Stewart, "An Address Delivered Before the Afric-American Female Intelligence Society of Boston" (1832) Here{\^a}in the only collection of speeches by nineteenth-century African-American women{\^a}is the battle of words these brave women waged to address the social ills of their century. While there have been some scattered references to the unique roles these early "race women" played in effecting social change, until now few scholars have considered the rhetorical strategies they adopted to develop their powerful arguments. In this chronological anthology, Shirley Wilson Logan highlights the public addresses of these women, beginning with Maria W. Stewart{\^a}s speech at Franklin Hall in 1832, believed to be the first delivered to an audience of men and women by an American-born woman. In her speech, she focused on the plight of the Northern free black. Sojourner Truth spoke in 1851 at the Akron, Ohio, Women{\^a}s Rights Convention not only for the rights of black women but also for the rights of all oppressed nineteenth-century women. Frances Ellen Watkins Harper struggled with the conflict between universal suffrage and suffrage for black men. Anna Julia Cooper chastised her unique audience of black Episcopalian clergy for their failure to continue the tradition of the elevation of womanhood initiated by Christianity and especially for their failure to support the struggling Southern black woman. Ida B. Wells{\^a}s rhetoric targeted mob violence directed at Southern black men. Her speech was delivered less than a year after her inaugural lecture on this issue{\^a}following a personal encounter with mob violence in Memphis. Fannie Barrier Williams and Victoria Earle Matthews advocated social and educational reforms to improve the plight of Southern black women. These speeches{\^a}all delivered between 1832 and 1895{\^a}are stirring proof that, despite obstacles of race and gender, these women still had the courage to mount the platform in defense of the oppressed. Introductory essays focus on each speaker{\^a}s life and rhetoric, considering the ways in which these women selected evidence and adapted language to particular occasions, purposes, and audiences in order to persuade. This analysis of the rhetorical contexts and major rhetorical tactics in the speeches aids understanding of both the speeches and the skill of the speakers. A rhetorical timeline serves as a point of reference. Historically grounded, this book provides a black feminist perspective on significant events of the nineteenth century and reveals how black women of that era influenced and were influenced by the social problems they addressed. "A government which can protect and defend its citizens from wrong and outrage and does not is vicious. A government which would do it and cannot is weak; and where human life is insecure through either weakness or viciousness in the administration of law, there must be a lack of justice, and where this is wanting nothing can make up the deficiency."{\^a}Frances Ellen Watkins Harper, "Duty to Dependent Races," National Council of Women of the United States, Washington, D.C. (1891)},

In this explosive book, Bryan Caplan argues that the primary function of education is not to enhance students' skill but to certify their intelligence, work ethic, and conformity{\^a}in other words, to signal the qualities of a good employee. Learn why students hunt for easy As and casually forget most of what they learn after the final exam, why decades of growing access to education have not resulted in better jobs for the average worker but instead in runaway credential inflation, how employers reward workers for costly schooling they rarely if ever use, and why cutting education spending is the best remedy. Caplan draws on the latest social science to show how the labor market values grades over knowledge, and why the more education your rivals have, the more you need to impress employers. He explains why graduation is our society's top conformity signal, and why even the most useless degrees can certify employability. He advocates two major policy responses. The first is educational austerity. Government needs to sharply cut education funding to curb this wasteful rat race. The second is more vocational education, because practical skills are more socially valuable than teaching students how to outshine their peers. Romantic notions about education being "good for the soul" must yield to careful research and common sense{\^a}The Case against Education points the way.},

Over the past few years, increasing attention has been given to the history of the British Empire and the nature of its contribution and legacy in the modern world (Louis, 1999; Ferguson, 2003; Brendon, 2007). Much of this general literature, for example, the recent fi ve-volume Oxford History of the British Empire (Louis, 1999), has included little material specifi cally on education. At the same time, a substantial literature has also developed on the ways in which the ideas and practices of education in Britain infl uenced the character of education in different parts of the British Empire. This literature has generated interesting debates around the nature of cultural imperialism, the relationship between the {\textquoteleft}centre{\textquoteright} and the {\textquoteleft}periphery{\textquoteright} (e.g. McCulloch {\&} Lowe, 2003), the extent to which imperial infl uences were benefi cial and the ways in which these infl uences were played out in different nations and areas. Latterly, there has been increasing interest in the kinds of resistance that developed on the part of colonised and indigenous groups. The case of New Zealand (Maori name Aotearoa), 12,000 miles away from Britain, will be examined in particular detail to demonstrate the extent and the characteristics of the imperial writ.},

In addition to covering the individual contributions of psychology, philosophy, linguistics, and artificial intelligence to cognitive science, the book has been revised to introduce the connectionist approach as well as the classical symbolic approach and adds a new chapter on cognitively related advances in neuroscience. Cognitive science is a rapidly evolving field that is characterized by considerable contention among different views and approaches. Cognitive Science presents these in a relatively neutral manner. It covers many new orientations theories and findings, embedding them in an integrated computational perspective and establishing a sense of continuity and contrast with more traditional work in cognitive science. The text assumes no prerequisite knowledge, introducing all topics in a uniform, accessible style. Many topics, such as natural language processing and vision, however, are developed in considerable depth, which allows the book to be used with more advanced undergraduates or even in beginning graduate settings.

abstract = {Foreword by Steven Pinker Blending the informed analysis of The Signal and the Noise with the instructive iconoclasm of Think Like a Freak, a fascinating, illuminating, and witty look at what the vast amounts of information now instantly available to us reveals about ourselves and our world{\textemdash}provided we ask the right questions. By the end of an average day in the early twenty-first century, human beings searching the internet will amass eight trillion gigabytes of data. This staggering amount of information{\textemdash}unprecedented in history{\textemdash}can tell us a great deal about who we are{\textemdash}the fears, desires, and behaviors that drive us, and the conscious and unconscious decisions we make. From the profound to the mundane, we can gain astonishing knowledge about the human psyche that less than twenty years ago, seemed unfathomable. Everybody Lies offers fascinating, surprising, and sometimes laugh-out-loud insights into everything from economics to ethics to sports to race to sex, gender and more, all drawn from the world of big data. What percentage of white voters didn{\textquoteright}t vote for Barack Obama because he{\textquoteright}s black? Does where you go to school effect how successful you are in life? Do parents secretly favor boy children over girls? Do violent films affect the crime rate? Can you beat the stock market? How regularly do we lie about our sex lives and who{\textquoteright}s more self-conscious about sex, men or women? Investigating these questions and a host of others, Seth Stephens-Davidowitz offers revelations that can help us understand ourselves and our lives better. Drawing on studies and experiments on how we really live and think, he demonstrates in fascinating and often funny ways the extent to which all the world is indeed a lab. With conclusions ranging from strange-but-true to thought-provoking to disturbing, he explores the power of this digital truth serum and its deeper potential{\textemdash}revealing biases deeply embedded within us, information we can use to change our culture, and the questions we{\textquoteright}re afraid to ask that might be essential to our health{\textemdash}both emotional and physical. All of us are touched by big data everyday, and its influence is multiplying. Everybody Lies challenges us to think differently about how we see it and the world.},

The negative, animalistic characteristics of man must be subordinated to the positive values of love and empathy without sacrificing creativity or selective capacities. It is proposed that a program of direct biochemical intervention be implemented to control negativistic tendencies, with compulsive criminals as pretest Ss. Ultimately, world leaders who have the nuclear power to determine the fate of humanity should be given the earliest perfected form of appropriate drugs. This requirement would control the barbaric use of power and insure that survival of the human species is not sacrificed to the personal ego pathos of powerful individuals.

The PhD output of our graduate schools by 1970 will not be likely to exceed 1200." It is estimated that some 1200 APA members (6% of present total membership) are in full-time private practice in clinical psychology. "The principal reason for the growth in private practice of clinical psychology probably will be found in the acute and growing shortage of professionals available to meet mental health demands{\ldots} . Sensible or not, the growth in psychology continues to be in the direction of application rather than basic research." (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2010 APA, all rights reserved)},

Not only is it key to understanding his life and thoughts, but also the politics of South Asia in the first half of the twentieth century. Celebrating 100 years since Hind Swaraj was first published in a newspaper, this centenary edition includes a new Preface and Editor's Introduction, as well as a new chapter on 'Gandhi and the 'Four Canonical Aims of Life''. The volume presents a critical edition of the 1910 text of Hind Swaraj, fully annotated and including Gandhi's own Preface and Foreword (not found in other editions). Anthony J. Parel sets the work in its historical and political contexts and analyses the significance of Gandhi's experiences in England and South Africa. The second part of the volume contains some of Gandhi's other writings, including his correspondence with Tolstoy and Nehru.},

In 1926, the group requested the American Council on Education to sponsor a study of personnel practices in colleges and universities. As a result of this request the Council established the Committee on Personnel Methods with H.E. Hawkes as chairman.},

That A is normally followed by B will explain A's being followed by B in the next instance." (532).

abstract = {Artwork can often pique the interest of the viewer or listener as a result of the ambiguity or instability contained within it. Our engagement with uncertain sensory experiences might have its origins in early cortical responses, in that perceptually unstable stimuli might preclude neural habituation and maintain activity in early sensory areas. To assess this idea, participants engaged with an ambiguous visual stimulus wherein two squares alternated with one another, in terms of simultaneously opposing vertical and horizontal locations relative to fixation (i.e., stroboscopic alternating motion; von Schiller, 1933). At each trial, participants were invited to interpret the movement of the squares in one of five ways: traditional vertical or horizontal motion, novel clockwise or counter-clockwise motion, and, a free-view condition in which participants were encouraged to switch the direction of motion as often as possible. Behavioral reports of perceptual stability showed clockwise and counter-clockwise motion to possess an intermediate level of stability compared to relatively stable vertical and horizontal motion, and, relatively unstable motion perceived during free-view conditions. Early visual evoked components recorded at parietal-occipital sites such as C1, P1 and N1 modulated as a function of visual intention. Both at a group and individual level, increased perceptual instability was related to increased negativity in all three of these early visual neural responses. Engagement with increasingly ambiguous input may partly result from the underlying exaggerated neural response to it. The study underscores the utility of combining neuroelectric recording with the presentation of perceptually multi-stable yet physically identical stimuli, in revealing brain activity associated with the purely internal process of interpreting and appreciating the sensory world that surrounds us.},

Using data from a survey of Anchorage, AK, residents (n~=~971, response rate~=~59%), we explored relationships between general wildlife value orientations and (1) the general acceptability of hunting urban wildlife populations, and (2) specific wildlife management actions (e.g., the acceptability of destroying a bear or moose after specific conflict situations). Consistent with previous research, patterns of basic wildlife beliefs aligned along two distinct value orientations (protection{\textendash}use and wildlife appreciation) that differentially predicted management action acceptability. As hypothesized, general wildlife value orientations had more influence on the acceptability of hunting to reduce wildlife populations than destroying an animal involved in specific conflict situations. Findings suggested ways to improve measurement, ways to develop broader models that includ...},

Psychiatry, he argues, in insisting on its perrogatives of primary patient responsibility and control of treatment facilities, bases its justification either on rare and uncertain genetic and metabolic conditions or on the common chronic organic conditions it characteristically neglects; the typical personl in psychiatric treatment is suffering from neither. The alternative presented here is a social-developmental model, which would emphasize the nurturance of strength rather than the search for and excision of weakness.},

It draws on material not only from schools and colleges, but also from the broader educative or miseducative nature of the 'ethos' of society and some of its major institutions. Sifting the different views about aims which are now prevalent and circulating in the world of education, he integrates the more defensible of them into an articulated set of positive recommendations. The study takes a broadly philosophical and non-technical stand; it is written to help practitioners orient themselves in what is often bewildering territory, at a time when the question of what the aims of education ought to be has acquired a new urgency for politicians and educational administrators, as well as for those directly involved in educational institutions, head teachers and their staff.},

Rousseau, the author explains, believed that life in modern societies undermines virtue, but that for individuals to thrive, and for free societies to endure, all would require moral education. Rousseau, who styled himself "a friend of virtue," sought to impart virtue to his readers through the examples of his literary characters Emile and Julie.".},

abstract = {Despite an increasing volume of talk about and a growing literature on higher education, very little of it asks the question - what, in essence "is" higher education? The tradition of overarching thinking about higher education - from Newman onwards - has almost vanished. The debate has focused, instead, on technical, administrative, financial and narrow academic concerns and the terms of discussion have been framed by concepts such as efficiency, unit costs, access and the needs of industry - none of which focus on higher education as such. There is, therefore, a need for the aims of higher education to be restated in modern terms. This book explores such concepts as culture, rationality, research and academic freedom; it aims to provide a new approach to educational theory, embracing debates in social theory, philosophy of social science, critical theory, sociology of education and sociology of knowledge. It aims to give an account of the idea of "higher education" draw out the practical implications and propose specific strategies for realizing a liberal higher education.},

Group HE (n = 5) received a high response expectancy, Group LE (n = 5) a low response expectancy, and Group HLE observed one planarian under each expectancy condition. Group HE reported 18% contractions and 49% head turns in 100 trials whereas Group LE reported but 9% and 9.9%. Group HLE reported 15.4% contractions and 30% head turns under high expectancy instructions, but only 4.8% and 15.4% under low expectancy instructions. Analyses of the effect of instructions between Groups HE and LE and within Group HLE both yielded significant F ratios (P < .001). Although it is unwise to generalize from naive volunteers to sophisticated investigators, it is clear that response recording in planaria should be made less ambiguous, perhaps by taking photographic records.},

He shows us waitresses making lightning-fast calculations, carpenters handling complex spatial mathematics, and hairdressers, plumbers, and electricians with their aesthetic and diagnostic acumen. Rose, an educator who is himself the son of a waitress, explores the intellectual repertory of everyday workers and the terrible social cost of undervaluing the work they do. Deftly combining research, interviews, and personal history, this is one of those rare books that has the capacity both to shape public policy and to illuminate general readers.},

All, however, have the virtue of being objective findings rather than subjective impressions.

There may potentially occur total shut down. The purpose of such an experiment is to search for influence from the future, that is, backward causation. Since LHC will produce particles of a mathematically new type of fundamental scalars, i.e., the Higgs particles, there is potentially a chance to find unseen effects, such as on influence going from future to past, which we suggest in the present paper.},

This represented a compromise between the view that preferential homosexuality is invariably a mental disorder and the view that it is merely a normal sexual variant. While the 1973 DSM-II controversy was highly public, more recently a related but less public controversy involved what became the DSM-III category of Ego-dystonic Homosexuality. The author presents the DSM-III controversy and a reformulation of the issues involved in the diagnostic status of homosexuality. He argues that what is at issue is a value judgment about heterosexuality, rather than a factual dispute about homosexuality. },

abstract = {This introductory text, now in its fourth edition, is a classic in its field. It shows, first and foremost, the importance of philosophy in educational debate and as a background to any practical activity such as teaching. What is involved in the idea of educating a person or the idea of educational success? What are the criteria for establishing the optimum balance between formal and informal teaching techniques? How trustworthy is educational research? In addition to these questions, which strike to the heart of the rationale for the educative process as a whole, the authors explore such concepts as culture, creativity, autonomy, indoctrination, needs, interests and learning by discovery. In this new updated edition, the authors draw on the latest research in genetics to argue that education is uniquely human and is essentially what develops us as humans. Resisting modern tendencies to equate knowledge with opinion, and value judgements with taste, this book leads the reader into the business of philosophising and champions the cause of reason in education.},

Learning by observing and evaluating the actions of others, informed reinforcement where the S is aware of the desired outcome, the extent to which restraints of conscience are operative, and recent developments in the analyses of memory and cognition also are discussed. Growing public concern over manipulation and control by psychological methods, and the possible misuse of improved means of influence, frequently articulated by popular writers and by theorists themselves, is refuted by the empirical facts of human behavior.
