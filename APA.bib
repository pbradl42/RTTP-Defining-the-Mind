Psychiatry, he argues, in insisting on its perrogatives of primary patient responsibility and control of treatment facilities, bases its justification either on rare and uncertain genetic and metabolic conditions or on the common chronic organic conditions it characteristically neglects; the typical personl in psychiatric treatment is suffering from neither. The alternative presented here is a social-developmental model, which would emphasize the nurturance of strength rather than the search for and excision of weakness.},

abstract = {Discusses the necessity of using a multidisciplinary approach to social problems and psychology's distinctive contribution through the scientific explanation of human behavior. The psychologist is obligated to differentiate between his personal values or beliefs and the assertions deriving from psychological science. Psychotechnology is needed to provide mediating links between basic research and practical problems. Psychology can also contribute to solving social problems through cultural diffusion of well-established psychological knowledge, illustrated by such broad, orienting concepts as interaction of variables, overlapping of group ranges, multidimensionality of individual differences, and modifiability of behavior. Social problems can be most effectively solved by encouraging diversity of approaches through different disciplines as well as within psychology. In society at large, the cultivation of diversity enriches the culture and protects the individual against undue control from any 1 source. (84 ref.)

abstract = {"It is our purpose{\ldots} to examine manpower trends in psychiatry, psychology, and social work." Two major problems relating to higher education are: (1) That many bright young people do not receive the training for which they are intellectually competent, and (2) That because of heightened birth rate beginning in the 1940's, a substantial rise in college enrollments can be expected within the next decade. The demand for trained personnel in the field of mental health is considered. Separate sections titled "Psychiatrists," "Psychologists," and "Social Workers" discuss the supply of and need for professional workers within each field. 50-item bibliography.

Consideration of the cost of viable alternatives includes 4 possible courses: (a) perpetuation of the Boulder model, (b) development of separate professional schools of psychology, (c) effecting a new liaison with another major profession, and (d) abandonment of clinical psychology as a separate field. Because of the difficulties in financing professional training, and the impending increased demand for teachers of psychology, it is concluded that clinical psychology, as it has developed, may decline in strength and importance for the next few years.
