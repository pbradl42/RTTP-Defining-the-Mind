Ennis argues that Harman's notion of what is to be explained (i.e. 'All A's are B's; the next A will be B; s, as an instance of A, is B') fails to distinguish between cases where A and B are the result of some other factor C, or A causes something to be B.}

The then advances (1) thinking is non-utilitarian (Arendt / Hiedegger inspired) (2) Socrates is an ideal thinker (3) thinking is always 'out of order'. (4)Thinking is inherently 'critical' (5) thinking is dialectical (6) thinking abhors contradiction [intersects with reasoning] (7) thinking is the aspiration of eros (8) thinking is not 'strong sense CT' 
The further claim is that teaching reasoning does not make people better (thinkers  / moral): (1) the consideration is with the process, or activity, rather than the objects of thing (2) it is a need expressed in terms of eros. (3) thinking is 'wholeness'. (4) thinking is 'thanking' 
Crazy generalization of causal claim on pg 207 - rise in CT movement because of rise of japanese technological superiority

Only thing that looks like a conclusion is that the virtue of thinking needs practica - 'igniting the kind of meaning-wonderment, contemplation and self-transcendence described above is exceedingly difficulty. '}
