# RTTP-Defining the Mind

'Defining the Mind' is an in-progress [Reacting to the Past](https://reacting.barnard.edu/) game. 
  
The documents are maintained in Scrivener, and published via LauLatex.  Changes *must* be made to the Scrivener documents or they will be over-written at compliation.

The current Scrivener file is 'GameBook2.0.3.scriv.' It contains the Game Book, the Instructor's Manual and the Role Sheets in 'RTTP2.0' format. Most of the primary source PDF files are contained in the 'research' section.  Previous versions are archived in 'Obsolete'.

The file 'APA-Complete-2.X.pdf' is the complete build, including all three books. As I complete a version, I will update this file.  The current working version is 2.0.3.  Books will eventually be separated once I have a full, viable, version.  They are kept together for hte sake of cross-referencing.
