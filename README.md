# RTTP-Defining the Mind

'Defining the Mind' is an in-progress [Reacting to the Past](https://reacting.barnard.edu/) game. 
  
The documents are maintained in Scrivener, and published via LauLatex.  Changes *must* be made to the Scrivener documents or they will be over-written at compliation.

The current Scrivener file is 'GameBook2.0.3.scriv.' It contains the Game Book, the Instructor's Manual and the Role Sheets in 'RTTP2.0' format. Most of the primary source PDF files are contained in the 'research' section.  Previous versions are archived in 'Obsolete'.

The file 'APA-Complete-2.X.pdf' is the complete build, including all three books. As I complete a version, I will update this file.  The current working version is 2.1.0.  Books will eventually be separated once I have a full, viable, version.  They are kept together for the sake of cross-referencing.

## Tables and figures

With Scrivener 3 updated (Version 2.1.0), I've tried to use MMD tables as much as possible. Long tables, either by height or width, require direct coding in LaTeX. These passages are escaped from MMD processing by ` and `{=latex}
