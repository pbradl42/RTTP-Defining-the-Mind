# RTTP-Defining the Mind

'Defining the Mind' is an in-progress <a href="https://reacting.barnard.edu/>Reacting to the Past</a> game. 
  
The documents are maintained in Scrivener, and published via LauLatex.  Changes *must* be made to the Scrivener documents or they will be over-written at compliation.

The Scrivener file 'GameBook2.0.scriv' contains the Game Book, the Instructor's Manual and the Role Sheets in 'RTTP2.0' format.  Previous versions will be archived once I get around to it.

The file 'APA-Complete-2.X.pdf' is the complete build, including all three books. Each will be separated out when I get around to it.
