Onl.y in the consultation roorn does the horlosexual reveal hinrself nnd his world. No other data. statistics. or statenrents can be' itccepted as setting lbrth the true nature of ho- nrosexuality. All othel sources may be heavily weighted by face-saving devices or rationalizations or, if they issue from lay bodies, Iack the scien- tific and medical background to
support their views- The best that can be said for the well-intentioned but unqualified observel is that he is misguided because he does not have and can not appl.y those iech- niques which would make it possible to discern the deep underlying clin- ical disorder or to evaluate the emo- tional patterns and interpelsonal events in the life of a homosexual.
T'here are many doctors who. by ignoring and disregarding hornosex- uality. hope to render it invisible and nonexistent. To acknowledge it would be tantamount, they fear, to permitting it. In my opinion. part of medicine's neglect has been due not only to uncert:rinty concerning etiol- ogy. treatment, and prognosis but

Homosexuality-Socandes 1199
￼a conservative estimate is that be tween 2,500,000 and 4,000,000 adult American males sufier from this con- dition. By way of comparison, a Public Health Service report esti- mates the four major illnesses in this country (1963 to 1965) as: heart disease, 3,619,000; arthritis and rheumatism, 3,481,00O; impairment (except paralysis) of the back and spine, 1,769,000; mental and nervous disease, 1,767,000.u
The female homosexual finds her- self in a paradoxical situation. Al- though suffering in essence with the same disorder as her male counter- part, little concern has been manifest by either the medical or legal pro- fessions about her condition. She too, however, needs special medical, legal, and sociological consideration.
Many writers prefer to use the term "lesbianism" to describe the clinical condition of female homo- sexuality. This reflects an attempt to romanticize and minimize it. Ho- mosexual relations between women are often considered superficial and some sources do not regard female homosexual contacts as sexual at all despite intense orgastic experiences between the women involved. Never- theless, their plight is as grave if not more so than that of the male homo- sexuals. For example, the loss of a homosexual partner can lead the bereft female homosexual to severe depressions and suicide with greater frequency than in the male.
I have dealt intensively with the illnesses diagnosed as perversions,'' '5 especially with homosexuality, fol the past 15 years-both in clinical practice and in teaching. Our first step is to ask ourselves "What is a homosexual?" fn essence, a homo- sexual is a person who consistently and from inner necessity engages in homosexual acts. This pattern arises from faulty sexual identity, a prod- uct of the earliest years of life. Typ- ically, we find a pathological family constellation in which there is a domineering, crushing mother who will not allow the developing child to
achieve autonomy from her and an absent, weak, or rejecting father.
There are two categories of home' sexuality: obligatory (true) homo- sexuality and episodic homosexual behavior. The latter is characterized by isolated homosexual acts without the stereotypy, the corhpulsivity, of the former and is due to the con- scious desire for variational experi- ence, the achievement of "sPecial gains," such as power and Prestige, or the quest for unusual sensations. Such transient behavior may occur in specific situations as well; it may be rampant in prisons, remote set- tlements, or during other tYPes of confinement where persons of the opposite sex are not available. Ex- cept for those already predisposed to homosexuality through early psy- chological trauma, the individual reverts to heterosexual behavior when members of the oPPosite sex are again available. Current research points to the fact that a person does not become a true obligatorY homo- sexual if the initial design is not laid out by 3 years of age, that is, during the preoedipal period of develoP- ment.
There is a high incidence of Para- noia or paranoid-like symptomato- logy in overt homosexuals. This is related to the medical fact that overt obligatory homosexuality is either a fixation or regression to the earliest stages of ego development. As a re- sult, archaic and primitive mental mechanisms belonging to the earliest stages of life characterize the homo- sexual's behavior. Also, homosexual- ity, obligatory or not, can be seen in the schizophrenic in his frantic at- tempt to establish some vestige of object relations as an expression of the fragmented and disorganized psychic apparatus with which he has to struggle.
It is misleading to classifY homo- sexuality as a sociopathic disorder. Not all homosexuals or perhaps even a majority display the "absence of conscience" mechanism so charac- teristic of the so-called psychopath.
The compulsivity of the sexual pression, its insistence for despite all dangers to the
and all risks, gives the
that one does not care about lished social institutions or oneself. The annals of political tory include personalities at very highest levels, men with exceptionally well-developed
of public and social good, who experienced the tragic
of their homosexual illness.

2. Homosexual obiect choice is .not innate or instinctual nor is hetcr- cexual object choice since botlr are learned behavior. The choice of sex- rul object is not predetermined by
chromosomal tagging. Heter&lt;lsexual object choice is determined from birth due to cultural and environ- mental indoctrination. It is support- .ed by universal human concepts of lnating and the family unit with the omplementariness and contrast be-
the two sexes- It is further determined bv zVz billion years of
evolution and is a producl of sexual differentiation, at first y based on reproduction but widened to include sexual ification, eg, from one-celled
al fission the development of two-celled sexual reproduction to
rate entire organ differentiation finally to the development of rate individuals reciprocally
to each other anatomically. nologically, psychologically,
in many other ways.
Only massive childhood fears can
ge and disrupt the standard female pattern. Such early un- ious feals are responsible for
later development of homosex- ty.
3. Homosexual behavior which is igatory ( episodic t is prac- by individuals through choice a variety of motivations and ld not be confused with true
xuality. These motivations as complex as any other moti- which may influence humnn ior: personal gain. power, Farch for a variational experience (an extra sexual "thrill" r, pr.eferred and position, etc. This form not caused by unconscious fears ensuing guilt but is due to con- deliberate choice. One must ull.y differentiate between the tory and the nonobligatoly as latter type would like to mask
behind true honrosexuality in order to save plidc and iustify its occur- rence.
4. Since thc obligator.v lromosex- ual is suflering fronr an illness it is obvious that hc should not be lren- alized fol tlre consequent activities carried out in private, not oflensive to public decency, and in Jlartner- ship with a consenting adult. He should not be made to suffer special penalties because of the manifesta- tion of his illness so long as it is not
ac&lt;omp:rnied b-y antisrrcial or crim- inal behavior.
The view that obligatory homo- sexuality per se is punishable by law and thc view that it is, in fact, a medical problern are antithetical and this matter requires revision. How- ever. any change in the legal code should be accompanied by a clear- cut statement as to the nature of obligatory homosexualit.y, its diag- nosis as a form of mental illness, and a universal declaration of support
for its treatment by qualified medical practitioners.
The Wolfenden report'' succeed- ed in having legislation passed in England redressing the inequities Iaced by the homosexual but it re- grettably failed both the homosexual and the public by not making it ex- plicit that homosexuality is an emo- tional illness and, therefore, lies within the province of medicine. One might have recommended this addition to the Wolfenden report:
Homosexurtlitv is a form of e'motional disorder q'hit'h mav cause such grave clisruptiori to the equililrrium of thc in- dividual that all meaningful rt'lation- .ships in life are damaged from the outsel anrl peculiarly susceptible to breakdou'n :lnd destruction. Furlher. attitudes tou':rrd the olrllosite s€x ar€ so fille&lt;l q'ith dislrust, abhorrence, hate. anrl revulsion as tcl render thcnr imp&lt;lssiblc of anv relationshilr except on the' mo.st superficial and briltle basis, if then. The.sc characteristi&lt;'s are an outcome of childhood fears u'hich r.ripl&gt;lr, the individual in his total ad:rptation.
All nrale homosexuals suffer, para- doxically, fronr the yearning to be a
mart, not a woman ils conlmonly as- sumeal. They ho1;c to :rchieve a "shot" of nrasculinity in the homo- sexual act. Ostensitrly they ma.\'l)e- have in an alTcctionitte and kindly way towtird the sexuirl parttter bttt this is a veneer, a rationillization, to cover the life-saving, ego-saving o1t- er{rtion of obligatory homosuxualitv. The homosexuill must carry out his act; unless he does he will sufler in- tolerable anxiety and experience massive threat to his psychic organ-
ization nnd functioning. Like the addict, he must have his "fix."
In the light of clinical research the honrosexual symptom can be seen as an intricately designed de- fense whose purpose is to maintain the equilibrium of a severely disturb- ed individual. Tampering with his psyche by unqualificd persons is to be condemned as he may become seriously disorganized if a prema- turc attempt is made to interrupt his homosexual activities. Conversely, an individual, however impelled to- ward them, who has refrained from homosexual activities may be tragi- cally pushed into them by unwise guidance.
5. There is no obligatory homo- sexual who can be considered to be health.y. The very existence of this condition precludes it. Despite the appearance at any given time of adequate life performance, there is always extreme conflict present which threatens to disrupt this frag- ile adiustment.
6. As oblig:rtory homosexuality carl not be considered to be a legal isstre, so it can not be viewed as a problem of morality. As with psy- chosis and neurosis, it can not be regarded as n consequence of im- molality ol a manifestation of evil spilits occupying the body for which special tortures were devised and special legal punishment was ex- acted.
These misconceptions must be corrected. It would, however, be the utmost folly to remed.Y then.r and then disrniss or overlook the deeP

￼psychological disturbance which is the basis of the homosexual condi- tion. Some well-intentioned groups would have us not only do away with legal and moral issues but have us announce that homosexuals are not ill at all. They point to disturbances among heterosexuals and attempt to make a comparison. While the ex- istence of psychosis and neurosis are, of course, found in heterosexual- ity, the heterosexual orientation is not, of itself, an indication of path- ological condition while homosex- uality always is. The inability to function heterosexually and the ex- treme hostility toward the opposite sex originating in the fear of one's impulses toward the mother has led to a wholesale flight from the female forever and to a compromise adapta- tion of choosing a male for sexual gratification and to save the self from intolerable anxiety.
We practice today in the atmos- phere of a sweeping sexual revolu- tion. Together with the mainstream heterosexual revolt has come the an- nouncement that a homosexual rev- olution is also in progress and that homosexuality should be granted total acceptance as a valid form of sexual functioning, different from but equal to heterosexuality. Such acceptance of homosexuality, as being a simple variation of normal- ity, is naive, not to say grounded in ignorance. Equally misleading is the idea that it is merely an asPect of normal development, a transient stage of adolescence, without mean- ingful sequallae. That we, as phy- sicians, could be persuaded to overlook such tcnden&lt;'ies among our young people is a harmful fantasy as shown by the fact that colleges can be pressured to charter homo- sexual groups on campus with all the privileges of other scholastic alrd social organizations, thereby lending tacit approval.
The implications of such trends are profound. I'or the adolescent, they make him uncertilin and con- fused. Even for an adult, struggling
to strengthen what may be a frail heterosexual- organization, the vi- cissitudes of maintaining sexual adequacy may drive him into a self- despising homosexual pattern. He does not know how else to resolve the deep conflicts which have per- sisted and tortured him since early childhood. Homosexuality is a fore- doomed attempt to find a panacea for the tormenting fear which origi- nated in early childhood and like any unrealistic solution remains un- satisfactory at all times and disas- trous much of the time.
It is vitally important to realize this fundamental point: the diag- nosis of homosexuality can not be self-made, imposed by jurists, ar- ticulated by clergy, or speculated about by social scientists. True ob- ligatory homosexuality is a complex condition and has to be difrerenti- ated from episodic homosexual be- havior entered into for a variety of conscious motivations as stated.
If the homosexual is to be granted his human right as a medical pa- tient, issues which becloud his status should be clarified. Above all, the homosexual must be recognized as an individual who presents a med- ical problem.
The whole issue of homosexuality must be transformed into one more scientific challenge to medicine which has time and again been :rble to alleviate the plaguing illnesses of man. With this respected leadership on the part of the physician, we will see a surge of support for the study and treatment of the disorder by all the techniques and knowledge nvail- able through the great resources and medical talent of the United States.

            <Text>A Warning Sign on the Road to DSM‐5: Beware of its Unintended Consequences Allen Frances, MD
We should begin with full disclosure. As head of the DSM‐IV Task Force, I established strict guidelines to ensure that changes from DSM‐III‐R to DSM‐IV would be few and well supported by empirical data. Please keep this history in mind as you read my numerous criticisms of the current DSM‐V process‐especially its stated ambition to effect a "paradigm shift" in psychiatric diagnosis. It is reasonable for you to wonder whether I am carrying forward an inherently conservative bias or am protecting my own DSM‐IV baby. I think not and that instead I am identifying potentially grave problems in the DSM‐V goals, methods, and products. It is for the reader to judge my objectivity and the accuracy of my fears that, unless its course is corrected, DSM‐V will lead to many damaging unintended consequences.
Much of our work on the DSM‐IV centered on spotting and avoiding possible misuses of the system. Realizing that errors in the official system of psychiatric diagnosis can lead to all sorts of dreadful problems, we established a rigorous three‐stage procedure of empirical documentation to filter out mistakes. This consisted of systematic and extensive literature reviews, data reanalyses, and field testing that were conducted under well controlled conditions and in a wide variety of settings.1‐3 The null position was always to keep things stable. Thus, all suggested changes had to meet a high burden of empirical proof and risk/benefit analysis.
The work on DSM‐IV was transparent and widely inclusive.4 We knew how important it was to get as many critical comments as possible to assist us in spotting potential pitfalls and blind spots. To this end, we enlisted the help of over 1,000 advisors and, in particular, sought the opinions of those who were likely to be the most opposed to the possible changes being considered. In order to recruit as many comments as possible from users at large, we also prepared a regular and widely distributed newsletter and had a regular column in the journal Hospital and Community Psychiatry (now called Psychiatric Services).5
Our goal was to ensure that not only the DSM‐IV Task Force, but also the entire field, would understand precisely what we were doing and how we were going about it. The methods to be used for every step in the development of DSM‐IV were specified in advance and we closely adhered to them. It was made clear from the outset that there would be explicit accountability for decision‐making on all changes.
We published a number of articles to establish the methodology of the DSM‐IV empirical review, to indicate ways of judging the value and risks of "innovations,"5 and to fully discuss the pluses and minuses of the particular diagnostic changes that were under review.1,2,6‐9
In midstream, we published a widely distributed "Options Book"10 containing the alternative criteria sets proposed for every disorder. This gave everyone a chance to join us in evaluating each decision for change in DSM‐ IV. After the DSM‐IV was completed, we published four Sourcebooks, laying out in great detail the process and rationale for all the decisions that had been made, as well as their empirical support.11‐14
Why did we go to all this trouble in preparing DSM‐IV and why am I suggesting that the work on DSM‐V should now undergo a sharp mid‐term correction to provide safeguards by becoming far more transparent, explicit, and
conservative than it has been to date?
The work on DSM‐5 has, so far, displayed an unhappy combination of soaring ambition and remarkably weak methodology. First, let's expose the absurdity of the DSM‐V claim that it will constitute a "paradigm shift" in psychiatric diagnosis and indicate the dangers inherent in pursuing this false goal. The simple truth is that descriptive psychiatric diagnosis does not need and cannot support a paradigm shift. There can be no dramatic improvements in psychiatric diagnosis until we make a fundamental leap in our understanding of what causes mental disorders. The incredible recent advances in neuroscience, molecular biology, and brain imaging that have taught us so much about normal brain functioning are still not relevant to the clinical practicalities of everyday psychiatric diagnosis. The clearest evidence supporting this disappointing fact is that not even one biological test is ready for inclusion in the criteria sets for DSM‐5.
So long as psychiatric diagnosis is stuck at its current descriptive level, there is little to be gained and much to be lost in frequently and arbitrarily changing the system. Descriptive diagnosis should remain fairly stable until, disorder by disorder, we gradually attain a more fundamental and explanatory understanding of causality.
Remember that there has been only one paradigm shift in psychiatric diagnosis in the last 100 years‐‐the introduction of operational criteria sets and the multiaxial system in the DSM‐III.15,16 With these methodological advances, DSM‐III rescued psychiatric diagnosis from unreliability and the oblivion of irrelevancy. In the evolution of descriptive diagnosis, DSM‐III‐R and DSM‐IV were really no more than footnotes to DSM‐III and, at best, DSM‐V could only hope to join them in making a modest contribution. Descriptive diagnosis is simply not equipped to carry us much further than it already has. The real paradigm shift will require an increase in our knowledge‐not just a rearrangement of the furniture of the various descriptive possibilities.
Part of the exaggerated claim of a "paradigm shift" in DSM‐5 is based on the suggestion that it will be introducing 30 or more dimensional ratings and that this will increase the precision of diagnosis. I am a big fan of dimensional diagnosis and wrote a paper promoting its use as early as 1982.17 Naturally, I had hoped to expand the role of dimensional diagnosis in DSM‐IV, but I came to realize that busy clinicians do not have the time, training, or inclination to use dimensional ratings. Indeed, the dimensional components already built into the DSM system (i.e., severity ratings of mild, moderate, and severe for every disorder and the Axis V Global Assessment of Functioning scale) are very often ignored. Including an ad hoc, untested, and overly complex dimensional system in an official nomenclature is premature and will likely lead to similar neglect and confusion.18 Providing an opportunity for dimensional ratings certainly does not constitute a paradigm shift and should not be oversold.
If the potential gains of DSM‐V are likely to be extremely modest, the potential risks are great and, so far, have gone largely unrecognized. Making changes in the diagnostic system is never cheap or free of risks. Just as when treating an individual patient, the first consideration in revising the diagnostic classification must always be to "do no harm"‐and the harm inflicted by changes in the DSM diagnostic system can come in many, and usually unexpected, forms.
The most obvious adverse outcome is the significant burden to the field of having to learn and adapt to any changes included in DSM‐5. This cost will be borne by all clinicians, educators, administrators, and especially by mental health researchers.19 The most noxious changes are those that frivolously lead to a need for new diagnostic instruments (or result in findings that are not comparable over studies and over time). This wastes money, slows progress, and makes it far more difficult to translate research findings into clinical practice. Any "innovations" made in DSM‐5 should be clear and proven winners or they will not be worth the high overhead cost
inherent in any change. Moreover, my experience suggests that, unless strong supporting evidence is required for the changes made in DSM‐5, it is likely that many of the changes will inevitably be trivial, arbitrary, and excessively influenced by the views of one or several strong‐minded experts in any given work group.
There is also the serious, subtle, and ubiquitous problem of unintended consequences. As a rule of thumb, it is wise to assume that unintended consequences come often and in very varied and surprising flavors. For instance, a seemingly small and reasonable change can sometimes result in a different definition of caseness that may have a dramatic and totally unexpected impact on the reported rates of a disorder.20 Thus are false "epidemics" created. For example, although many other factors were certainly involved, the sudden increase in the diagnosis of autistic disorder, attention‐deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and bipolar disorder may in part reflect changes made in the DSM‐IV definitions. Note that this serious unintended consequence occurred despite the fact that careful field testing of the DSM‐IV versions of two of these disorders had predicted no substantial differences in their rates as measured by DSM‐III, DSM‐IV, and ICD‐10 criteria.21,22
The crucial lesson here is that even careful field testing is never completely accurate in predicting what will happen when the system is eventually used in the actual field. This issue becomes particularly poignant when one considers the great and skillful pressure that is likely to be applied by the pharmaceutical industry after the publication of DSM‐5. It has to be assumed that they will attempt to identify every change that could conceivably lead to a marketing advantage‐often in ways that will not have occurred to the DSM‐5 Task Force. In order to promote drug sales, the companies may well sponsor expensive "education" campaigns focusing on the diagnostic changes that most enhance the rate of diagnosis for those disorders that will lead to the increased writing of prescriptions. It should, therefore, be no surprise if there are many new "epidemics" based on changes in DSM‐V.
This risk is accentuated by the fact that the field testing for DSM‐5 will receive no support from the National Institute of Mental Health. The necessary resources will not be available to measure the impact of suggested changes on the reliability and reported rates of diagnoses in the widely varied settings in which DSM‐5 will be used. In addition, because no DSM‐5 Options Book or first draft is being produced, the "DSM‐5 field trials" are not really field trials at all‐they are no more than primary data collections that will have little to say about how the final draft of DSM‐5 will perform in the field. DSM‐V decision‐making regarding changes will therefore be flying fairly blind.
Further accentuating is that almost everyone responsible for revising the DSM‐5 has spent a career working in the atypical setting of university psychiatry. This type of clinical experience is restricted to highly selected patients who are often treated in a research context. It is a basic tenet of clinical epidemiology that research results and clinical experience derived from tertiary care settings often do not generalize well when the diagnostic system has to be applied routinely in a more population‐based manner.23,24
Thus, the attempt to shift paradigms in the DSM‐5 is built on a shallow foundation that will greatly increase the risk of embarrassing post publication surprises. The ways to minimize the risks are to be cautious in making changes and to demand high levels of evidence about their utility and impact.
Unintended consequences are particularly unpredictable and consequential in forensic settings. Years after the DSM‐IV was completed, we learned about the enormous and unintended impact of a seemingly slight wording change we had made only for technical reasons in the section on paraphilias. A misreading of our intentions in making the change had led to great confusion25‐with forensic evaluators using the diagnosis of paraphilia not otherwise specified (NOS) to justify the sometimes inappropriate lifetime psychiatric commitment of rapists who
had no real mental disorder. The lesson is that even small changes can have destructive unanticipated forensic consequences.
The likelihood that DSM‐5 will suffer from many and serious unintended consequences is enhanced by the way it is being done. "There are no constraints on the degree of change," according to a telling quote from Dr. David Kupfer, chairman of the DSM‐V Task Force.26 The work groups have been instructed to think innovatively about the disorders under their purview. They have received little guidance on the systematic methods that can be used when conducting literature reviews.6 They have also not reviewed the DSM‐IV Sourcebooks to learn from our experience in evaluating the pluses and minuses for many of the very same decisions they are now confronting. It is a fundamental error of the DSM‐5 process that it has no a priori methods in place to provide standards for making changes and for instructing Work Group members on how to do a careful risk/benefit analysis of each proposal.
Even a cursory review of some of the suggestions for DSM‐5 clearly illustrates the painful surprises that can inadvertently creep into a system if there are no careful doorkeepers to evaluate the risks of change. I will discuss some representative types of problems for purposes of illustration?but most of the suggested changes for DSM‐V will likely have
problems of one sort or another.
Undoubtedly, the most reckless suggestion for DSM‐V is that it include many new categories to capture the milder subthreshhold versions of the existing more severe official disorders. The beneficial intended purpose is to reduce the frequency of false negative missed cases?thus improving early case finding and promoting preventive treatments. Unfortunately, however, the DSM‐V Task Force has failed to adequately consider the potentially disastrous unintended consequence that DSM‐V may flood the world with new false positives. The reported rates of DSM‐V mental disorders would skyrocket, especially since there are many more people at the boundary than those who present with the more severe and clearly "clinical" disorders. The result would be a wholesale imperial medicalization of normality that will trivialize mental disorder and lead to a deluge of unneeded medication treatments‐‐a bonanza for the pharmaceutical industry but at a huge cost to the new false positive "patients" caught in the excessively wide DSM‐V net. They will pay a high price in side effects, dollars, and stigma, not to mentions the unpredictable impact on insurability, disability, and forensics.
In my experience, experts on any given diagnosis always worry a great deal about missed cases, but rarely consider the risks of creating a large pool of false positives?especially in primary care settings. The experts' motives are pure, but their awareness of risks is often naïve. Psychiatry should not be in the business of inadvertently manufacturing mental disorders. I would therefore suggest that none of the proposed subthreshold suggestions be converted into official diagnoses of mental disorder in DSM‐V. Each should instead be included in an appendix of suggested disorders that require more research and testing.
A second, related category of innovation would be to include as defined mental disorders "prodromal" forms of the schizophrenic, mood, dementing and perhaps other disorders. This again has the obvious appeal of promoting early case finding and preventive treatment, but it also has all the same devastating problems we have just discussed. For example, adding a new "pre‐psychotic" category for individuals supposedly at high risk for later developing a psychotic disorder would inevitably also capture an overwhelmingly large group of false positives who would never go on to have a psychotic illness. They would nonetheless be exposed to the stigma of having a pre‐psychotic diagnosis and would be overmedicated. Similarly, wouldn't it be nice to diagnose and treat early cognitive failure before it becomes dementia? But then almost everyone over sixty might qualify to receive a
probably useless, but highly promoted treatment.
This is a drug company's dream come true. They would undoubtedly find ways of penetrating the huge new markets with medications having largely unproven benefit and very substantial side effects. Also to be considered carefully are the always possible unforeseen problems caused by stigma and the unforeseen misuse of the new diagnoses in forensic, disability, and insurance settings. Finally, the clinching argument against including prodromes is that they are supported only by thin literatures and will not have extensive field trials to predict the extent of the false positive risks, especially in primary care settings. Again, it would be far better to put these suggestions in the DSM‐V appendix than to make them official mental disorders.
A third category of DSM‐V innovation would create a whole new series of so‐called "behavioral addictions" to shopping, sex, food, videogames, the Internet, and so on. Each of these proposals has received little research attention, and they all have the potential for dangerous unintended consequences, by inappropriately medicalizing behavioral problems, reducing individual responsibility, and complicating disability, insurance, and forensic evaluations. None of these suggestions are remotely ready for prime time as officially recognized mental disorders.
I do not have space to enumerate the dangers of all the other innovative suggestions for DSM‐V, but I will list just some of the riskiest that require the most careful review and caution: adult attention‐deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and adult separation anxiety disorder; making it easier to diagnose bipolar disorder; pediatric bipolar, major depressive, and trauma disorders; autism spectrum disorders; new types of paraphilias and hypersexuality disorder; and the suggested rating list to evaluate suicidality.
The DSM‐V Task Force should be (but is not) routinely and quickly shooting down suggestions with obvious risks. But it should also be carefully and deeply probing into the much less obvious risks posed by every change. Getting as much outside opinion as possible is crucial to smoking out and avoiding unforeseen problems. We believed that the more eyes and minds that were engaged at all stages of DSM‐IV, the fewer the errors we would make. In contrast, DSM‐V has had an inexplicably closed and secretive process.27 Communication to and from the field has been highly restricted. Indeed, even the slight recent increase in openness about DSM‐V was forced on to an unwilling leadership only after a series of embarrassing articles appeared in the public press.28‐30 It is completely ludicrous that the DSM‐V Workgroup members had to sign confidentiality agreements that prevent the kind of free discussion that brings to light otherwise hidden problems. DSM‐V has also chosen to have relatively few and highly selected advisors. it appears that it will have no Options Book to allow wide scrutiny and contributions from the field.
The secretiveness of the DSM‐V process is extremely puzzling. In my entire experience working on DSM‐III, DSM‐III‐ R, and DSM‐IV, nothing ever came up that even remotely had to be hidden from anyone. There is everything to gain and absolutely nothing to lose from having a totally open process. Obviously, it is much better to discover problems before publication‐and
this can only be done with rigorous scrutiny and the welcoming of all possible criticisms.
In summary, then, I have little confidence that the DSM‐V leadership will do the kind of careful risk/benefit analysis of each proposed change that is necessary to avoid damaging unintended consequences. My concerns arise from: 1) their ambition to achieve a "paradigm shift" when there is no scientific basis for one 2) their failure to provide clear methodological guidelines on the level of empirical support required for changes; 3) their lack of openness to wide scrutiny and useful criticism; 4) their inability to spot the obvious dangers in most of their current proposals; 5) their failure to set and meet clear timelines; and 5) the likelihood that time pressure will soon lead to an
unconsidered rush of last minute decisions.
This is the first time I have felt the need to make any comments on DSM‐V. Even when the early steps in the DSM‐ V process seemed excessively ambitious, secretive, and disorganized, I hoped that I could avoid involvement and believed that my successors deserved a clear field. My unduly optimistic assumption was that the initial problems of secrecy and lack of explicitness would self‐correct and that excessive ambitions would be moderated by experience. I have decided to write this commentary now only because time is beginning to run out and I fear that DSM‐V is continuing to veer badly off course?and with no prospect of spontaneous internal correction. It is my responsibility to make my worries known before it is too late to act on them. What is needed now is a profound mid‐term correction toward greater openness, conservatism, and methodological rigor. I would thus suggest that the trustees of the American Psychiatric Association establish an external review committee to study the progress of the current work on DSM‐V and make recommendations for its future direction.

PREFACE
The APA Guidelines for the Undergraduate Psychology Major (hereinafter referred to as the Guidelines) captures a set of optimal expectations for performance at the completion of the baccalau- reate degree by students who major in psychology. The document out- lines 10 goals and suggested learning outcomes that represent reasonable departmental expectations for the undergraduate psychology major across educational contexts. The goals are divided into two major categories:
• Knowledge, skills, and values consistent with the science and application of psychology
• Knowledge, skills, and values consistent with liberal arts education that are further developed in psychology
Although the Guidelines can aid in curriculum design, goal setting, and assessment planning, faculty are encouraged to consider local factors, such as institutional and departmental missions and student characteristics, in their application. In this spirit, broad discussion of the document can facilitate departmental leadership in designing programs distinctively suited to the institution’s mission and students’ needs while attending to good practice benchmarks.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Why Do We Need the APA Guidelines for the Undergraduate Psychology Major?
For some time, there has been widespread concern about the quality of education at all levels in the United States, along with increasing pressure for accountability. Current best practices in
higher education rely on setting clear expectations for student learning, aligning curricula with these expectations, assessing student attainment, and using assessment results to effect changes that promote better stu- dent learning.
It was in this context that the Board of Educational Affairs (BEA) of the American Psychological Association (APA) appointed a task force to describe a set of learning goals and outcomes for student performance at the completion of the baccalaureate degree. The APA Guidelines for the Undergraduate Psychology Major was developed to articulate a common set of outcomes. A baccalaureate degree in psychology should document that students have the ability to think scientifically about behavior, the skills related to the conduct of research, and the values that reflect psychology as both a science and an applied discipline.
Variations in psychology’s academic organization in institutions of higher education across the country make it difficult to achieve consen-
sus on learning goals and outcomes. In some colleges and universities, psychology is part of a school or college comprising the social sciences.
In others, psychology is aligned with the natural sciences, the humani-
ties, or education. In addition to having organizational diversity, psychol- ogy departments differ with respect to programmatic emphases, student characteristics, faculty expertise, and resources. Undergraduate programs vary—as they should—to meet local, state, and regional needs. Despite 1 these differences, the BEA task force developed goals and outcomes that could be applied broadly across diverse educational contexts (e.g., campus-based programs, online instruction) in the context of liberal education at the undergraduate level.
The Guidelines captures a set of optimal expectations for student performance at the completion of the baccalaureate degree. Applying

these to individual departments, faculty must take into account local factors such as institutional and departmental missions and student characteristics. Regardless of department size and resources, the Guidelines presents reasonable overarching goals for the undergraduate psychology curriculum. Toward this end, these guidelines were developed to aid in curriculum design, goal setting, and assessment planning for the psychology major.
In addition to providing guidance about what constitutes a high-quality undergraduate education for majors in psychology, the Guidelines responds to a number of other important related needs:
•
•
•
•
The Guidelines firmly establishes the major as a science and reinforces a common identity within the discipline. Promoting psychology as a science is increasingly important given the enormous breadth of the discipline and the diversity of professional opportunities and psychological perspectives, including new interdisciplinary configurations.
The Guidelines describes a set of learning goals and outcomes for the psychology major. By making the expectations (outcomes) clear, the Guidelines serves as the basis for assessment plans.
Development of the Guidelines is an important step for the disci- pline and a means of contributing to a growing international effort to articulate goals and outcomes for the major. Dissemination and implementation of the Guidelines could also generate research on effective practices in undergraduate education in psychology.
Building on APA’s earlier efforts when approving the National Standards for the Teaching of High School Psychology (APA, 1999) and the revised National Standards for High School Psychology Curricula (APA, 2005), the Guidelines continues APA’s national focus on quality improvement. Completing expectations for appropriate education at the 4-year level adds an important piece of the
overall education and training context in psychology (see Benjamin, 2001).
The Guidelines provides a common set of outcomes that could aid in the development and evaluation of distance-learning courses and programs by promoting expectations for student learning compara- ble to those used in traditional classrooms.

APA GUIDELINES FOR THE UNDERGRADUATE PSYCHOLOGY MAJOR
Assumptions Underlying the Undergraduate Learning Outcomes
The learning goals and outcomes in this document rest on several key assumptions about the psychology major, the dynamic nature of the discipline, the diversity of psychology departments across the United States, and the assessment of performance relative to out- comes. As a framework for understanding the Guidelines, these assump- tions are that the learning goals and outcomes
• encompass the knowledge, skills, and values that are important for students to acquire in an undergraduate major in psychology within the context of a liberal education;
• incorporate the broad theoretical and research bases of psychology;
• reflect the use of a variety of pedagogical models, including service- learning, research and laboratory experiences, online applications, and traditional classroom approaches;
• foster the development of lifelong learning skills and include competencies that will prepare students for entrance into the workforce or acceptance into graduate or professional schools upon receipt of the baccalaureate degree;
• reflect the importance of diversity and cross-cultural issues in the discipline, as well as the growing internationalization of psychology and the need to prepare psychology majors to understand behavior and experience that may transcend geographic boundaries;
• apply to psychology departments across institutional settings that contribute to student achievement at the baccalaureate level;
• reflect the views that any outcome is meaningful only to the extent that it is accurately assessed and that the outcomes assessment process will focus on student performance if it is to improve learning and teaching;
3
￼• allow for many legitimate ways to reach a learning outcome, especially given that outcomes are developmental in nature; individual psychology departments determine the performance levels appropriate for their students and the assessment procedures and tools appropriate to measuring their students’ performance.
APA GUIDELINES FOR THE UNDERGRADUATE PSYCHOLOGY MAJOR
Use of the Term Guidelines
The term guidelines generally refers to pronouncements, statements, or declarations that recommend or suggest specific actions, goals, or endeavors. In this spirit, they are aspirational in intent. They are not intended to be mandatory or exhaustive and may not be applica- ble to every situation, nor are they intended to take precedence over the judgment of college and university faculty.
This use of the term guidelines is consistent with general practices
in the undergraduate education community. A primary consideration related to the nature of the document is the issue of academic freedom. The American Association of University Professors (AAUP) published a seminal paper articulating the principles of academic freedom meant to ensure the fundamental advancement of truth (see AAUP, 2006). Teachers are explicitly granted the right to exercise freedom in their discussions about respective disciplinary matters. Therefore, the Guidelines should be used only as a broad and general framework for
the undergraduate psychology major.
The term guidelines is also consistent with terminology used by other scientific organizations. The American Chemical Society (ACS; 2003) provides guidelines for the undergraduate major in chemistry. Although the ACS guidelines are for the purpose of accreditation, they offer only general curricular goals rather than an exact curriculum. Similarly, the American Physical Society, through the American Association of Physics Teachers (see Hilborn, Howes, &amp; Krane, 2003), provides general guidance for the undergraduate major in their report on the status of the undergraduate major in physics.
Finally, as used in this document, the term guidelines is consistent with the provisions of the APA policy on Developing and Evaluating Standards and Guidelines Related to Education and Training in Psychology
4 (Section I C[1]) (APA, 2004), as passed by the APA Council of Representatives.
Process of Developing the Guidelines
Five reports preceded the development of these guidelines, and many individuals and groups contributed to their initial develop- ment. Study of the curriculum can be traced back to the summer
￼APA GUIDELINES FOR THE UNDERGRADUATE PSYCHOLOGY MAJOR
of 1951 with the issuance of the Cornell Conference Report. This report emphasized psychology as a science grounded in the tradition of the liber- al arts. The report merely suggested that one introductory course should be followed by intermediate core courses (e.g., statistics and perception) and finally by advanced courses (e.g., social psychology and learning). The Michigan Conference Report followed approximately 10 years later, with less consensus about the structure of the undergraduate curriculum. Similarly, the Kulik Report (in 1973) and the Schreirer and Rogers Report (in 1985) provided only descriptive information about the undergraduate major (for more information on these reports, see Brewer et al., 1993). Ultimately, at the St. Mary’s Conference in 1991, Charles Brewer and his committee from the APA National Conference on Enhancing the Quality of Undergraduate Education in Psychology provided a broad structure for the undergraduate curriculum. Defining seven goals for the undergraduate major, Brewer and his colleagues suggested that the curriculum should include an introductory course, methodology courses, subfield content courses, and an integrative experience.
It was in this context, together with the movement in higher education to identify competencies as learning objectives, that the BEA appointed the Task Force on Psychology Major Competencies in 2000 to develop learning goals and outcomes for the undergraduate psycholo- gy major. Members of the task force represented a variety of institutional perspectives on the nature of the undergraduate curriculum and its aims. Under the leadership of Jane S. Halonen (chair), task force members included Drew C. Appleby, Charles L. Brewer, William Buskist, Angela R. Gillem, Diane Halpern, G. William Hill IV, Margaret A. Lloyd, Jerry L. Rudmann, and Valjean M. Whitlow. APA staff who contributed their expertise included Bernard C. Beins, now at Ithaca College, Maureen McCarthy, presently at Kennesaw State University, and Martha Boenau of the APA Education Directorate.
In the early stages of their work, the task force patterned its document after the guidelines developed by the Task Force on Outcomes for the California State University System, led by Mary Allen and Diane Halpern (past president of APA). The task force prepared a document that would serve as a resource to undergraduate psychology departments and faculty to assist with academic review processes and curriculum planning. As described in the Undergraduate Psychology Major Learning Goals and Outcomes (APA, 2002b), the task force identified 10
5
￼APA GUIDELINES FOR THE UNDERGRADUATE PSYCHOLOGY MAJOR
goals and suggested learning outcomes representing reasonable depart- mental expectations for the undergraduate psychology major across educational contexts. The goals were divided into two major categories: (a) knowledge, skills, and values consistent with the science and applica- tion of psychology and (b) knowledge, skills, and values consistent with liberal arts education that are further developed in psychology.
To extend representation to a diverse array of institutions and relevant organizations, the task force assembled an advisory panel to review drafts of the document. Through this process, the document was widely distributed to faculty at research universities, comprehensive universities, 4-year colleges, 2-year colleges, and high schools. Their comments were integrated into the Guidelines. The task force also sought and received helpful feedback from members of related profes- sional organizations with interests in psychology curricula. A final version of this document was endorsed by the BEA in March 2002 and made available to the undergraduate community as a report published on the APA Education Directorate Web site (see APA, 2002b).
By July 2002, the report was disseminated broadly to APA gover- nance groups and APA divisions, with a request for review and feedback. The Guidelines was also reviewed for attention to individual and cultural diversity issues consistent with the Guidelines on Multicultural Education, Research, Practice, and Organizational Change for Psychologists (APA, 2003); in addition, it was reviewed by the APA Committee on Ethnic Minority Affairs and the Committee on Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual Concerns. APA Boards and Committees received a final draft of the document in the spring of 2006. Subsequently, upon recommendation of the APA Board of Directors, the APA Council of Representatives adopted the Guidelines in August 2006.
Resource Documents
6 In developing the Guidelines, the task force reviewed the existing guidelines used by science-based disciplinary societies similar to APA, such as the American Chemical Society, the American
Physical Society (APS), and the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (ASBMB). These guidelines on the undergraduate curriculum were found to be similar in structure to the APA guidelines. For example, ASBMB (see Voet et al., 2003) explicitly stated that it was
￼APA GUIDELINES FOR THE UNDERGRADUATE PSYCHOLOGY MAJOR
no longer recommending a course-based curriculum. Instead, ASBMB provided content and student-outcome-focused guidance. Additional resources included use of the APA Ethical Principles of Psychologists and Code of Conduct (APA, 2002a) and the Handbook for Enhancing Undergraduate Education in Psychology (McGovern, 1993). The content contained in the Guidelines is consistent with APA’s Ethics Code.
Feedback
The Guidelines is a “living document.” Accordingly, APA has established a systematic plan for periodically reviewing and revising such documents to reflect developments in the discipline and in education. Reviews will occur every 7 years, which is consistent with APA Association Rule 30-8.3 requiring cyclical review of approved standards and guidelines within periods not to exceed 10 years. Comments and sug- gestions are welcomed.

￼APA GUIDELINES FOR THE UNDERGRADUATE PSYCHOLOGY MAJOR
APA GUIDELINES FOR THE UNDERGRADUATE PSYCHOLOGY MAJOR
Structure of the Guidelines
The APA Guidelines for the Undergraduate Psychology Major provides details for 10 suggested goals and related learning outcomes for the psychology major, grouped into two major categories.
Categories of Learning Goals and Outcomes
I. Knowledge, Skills, and Values Consistent With the Science and Application of Psychology
This category represents activities that provide hallmarks of psychology education. Responsibility for development in and assessment of these areas rests primarily with the psychology faculty in coursework or psychology advising.
II. Knowledge, Skills, and Values Consistent With Liberal Arts Education That Are Further Developed in Psychology
This category includes activities that are usually part of a general education program or liberal education. Responsibility for student development in these areas and assessment of students’ achievements tend to be shared across a broader range of disciplines than just psychology; however, psy- chology coursework can contribute to and expand upon these general edu- cation goals in significant ways. In turn, well-developed liberal education skills can contribute to student achievement within the psychology major.
Learning Goals
I. Knowledge, Skills, and Values Consistent With the Science and Application of Psychology 9
Goal 1: Knowledge Base of Psychology
Students will demonstrate familiarity with the major concepts, theoretical perspectives, empirical findings, and historical trends in psychology.
Goal 2: Research Methods in Psychology
Students will understand and apply basic research methods in
￼
￼10
psychology, including research design, data analysis, and interpretation.
Goal 3: Critical Thinking Skills in Psychology
Students will respect and use critical and creative thinking, skep- tical inquiry, and, when possible, the scientific approach to solve problems related to behavior and mental processes.
Goal 4: Application of Psychology
Students will understand and apply psychological principles to personal, social, and organizational issues.
Goal 5: Values in Psychology
Students will be able to weigh evidence, tolerate ambiguity, act ethically, and reflect other values that are the underpinnings of psychology as a discipline.
II. Knowledge, Skills, and Values Consistent With Liberal Arts Education That Are Further Developed in Psychology
Goal 6: Information and Technological Literacy
Students will demonstrate information competence and the ability to use computers and other technology for many purposes.
Goal 7: Communication Skills
Students will be able to communicate effectively in a variety of formats.
Goal 8: Sociocultural and International Awareness
Students will recognize, understand, and respect the complexity of sociocultural and international diversity.
Goal 9: Personal Development
Students will develop insight into their own and others’ behavior and mental processes and apply effective strategies for self-management and self-improvement.
Goal 10: Career Planning and Development
Students will emerge from the major with realistic ideas about how to implement their psychological knowledge, skills, and val- ues in occupational pursuits in a variety of settings.
APA GUIDELINES FOR THE UNDERGRADUATE PSYCHOLOGY MAJOR
Learning Outcomes
Each of the 10 goals includes specific, numbered outcomes that articu- late suggested strategies for how the goals can be demonstrated. Each goal can be addressed in departments’ curriculum designs and assess- ment plans; however, departments may choose formally to emphasize selected goals and outcomes depending on their emphases, traditions, or resources. Separate subpoints for particular outcomes provide further assistance in developing performance expectations.
An emphasis on certain content areas included as part of the learning goals and outcomes should not be construed as dictating course require- ments. For example, the emphasis on the development of career skills
does not imply that these activities must transpire in a formal course on careers in psychology. Similarly, the Guidelines should not be interpreted as advocating that separate courses in the history of psychology or group dynamics be included in the undergraduate curriculum. Rather, these guidelines are intended to empower and encourage departments to determine contexts in which students can learn those relevant skills
and perspectives.

Interpersonal dynamics in a prison environment are to be studied experimentally by designing a functional simulation of a prison in which subjects role-pay prisoners and guards for an extended period of time. To assess the power of the social forces on the emergent behavior in this situation, alternative explanations in terms of pre-existing dispositions are to be eliminated through subject selection. A homogeneous, “normal” sample is to be chosen after extensive interviewing and diagnostic testing of a large group of volunteer male college students. Half of the subjects are to be randomly assigned to role-play prison guards for eight hours each day, while the others role-play prisoners incarcerated for nearly one fill week. Neither group will receive any specific training in these roles. The primary investigator will role-play the prison warden, and consultants from the real prison population (both prisoners and prison officials) will be recruited to assist in the planning and implementation of the prison environment. 
Continuous, direct observation of behavioral interactions will be supplemented by video-taped recording, questionnaires, self-report scales and interviews. All these data sources are likely to converge on the conclusion that this simulated prison will develop into a psychologically compelling prison environment.

The Game
This game highlights the intellectual conflicts that changed American psychiatry and psychology in the early part of the 1970s. It might seem a little odd, in reacting game, to be exploring relatively recent events. While there will be no executions, ostracisms or civil wars in this game, the intellectual stakes are no less high. What you know of Psychiatry and Psychology today—the social significance of the APA's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM), the use of psychotropic drugs for 'everyday' life (such as Ritalin and Adderall), and the theoretically pluralistic basis of Psychology departments—originate in this time period, in this conflict.  

The game, however, does contain a significant misnomer: in reality there are two distinct associations named 'APA.' The American Psychiatric Association, which is composed of Medical Doctors who practice Psychiatry, maintains the DSM. The American Psychological Association, which is composed of academics (PhDs) who study the mind in a variety of ways, does not.  In this game, we have conflated these two distinct associations. If you are interested in studying these events in closer detail, most characters with MDs are members of the American Psychiatric Association, while characters with PhDs are members of the American Psychological Association. For the most part, events with which a character interacts occurred under the umbrella of their respective organizations.

During the course of this game, you will be the APA. You will be responsible for putting on annual conferences, where the nation's psychiatrists and psychologists meet to share their research and conduct association business. In 'real time', a single conference takes 1 week.  Each weekend of real time then, represents an entire year in game play time. According to your specific role, you may be presenting papers, participating in a symposium, serving on one of these committees, or even running for one.

Scheduling each conference is the responsibility of the conference committee.  The schedule for the first annual conference is already set: you can review it on p. Error! Bookmark not defined. . Pay careful attention to the schedule of submission and review detailed by the conference committee.  If your role sheet requires that you present your research at the conference, you must get your proposal to the conference committee on time. There is a detailed description of the form required for proposals provided under 'Error! Reference source not found.' on p. Error! Bookmark not defined..  

Introduction to Academic Conferences, 1971
Your cab pulls up in front of the Shoreham hotel  in Rock Creek Park, a particularly tranquil part of the chaos that is Washington D.C. You nervously check the entrance to the hotel. It's clear. This year, there are no throngs of protesters bent on face-to-face confrontation.
They must be down at the mall participating in the massive anti-war protest.  The radio reported an estimated crowd of at least 50,000. And that's before the 10,000 National Guardsmen were called into try to open the flow of traffic.
The story was not the same last year, in San Francisco.   
When you arrived at the hotel last year, the entrance was completely blocked by an angry crowd of gay rights activists. Individuals in the crowd personally confronting—non-violently but aggressively—any member of the APA who appeared. The activists called this 'Zapping.' You found it terrifying.
There are rumors that the FBI was in attendance last year, and it is almost certain they are here now. The conference was almost shut down. The Washington Post even covered the event:

The Washington Post May 14th 1970 -- The gay liberation and their women allies out-shrieked the head shrinkers today and took over an American Psychiatric Association session on sex. Before the morning was over the 500 psychiatrists who gathered to hear scientific studies on sexual problems demonstrated that they were just as prone to anti-social behaviour as anyone else. 'This lack of discipline is disgusting', said Dr Leo Alexander, a psychiatrist at the meeting. Then he diagnosed the problem of one of the lesbian protesters: 'She's a paranoid fool,' the doctor said, 'and a stupid bitch.'
The conference was a circus.  Young men dressed in flamboyant gowns stormed through the hallways. Sessions were disrupted by guerrilla theater. In one, an activist named Frank Kameny grabbed the microphone and shouted “Psychiatry is the enemy incarnate. Psychiatry has waged a relentless war of extermination against us. You may take this as a declaration of war against you.”
It all culminated in a session featuring Irving Bieber, author of the 1962 study on homosexuality published in his book Homosexuality.
According to eye witnesses, a protester interrupted Bieber almost before he started with the claim that “I've read your book Dr. Bieber, and if that book talked about black people the way it talks about homosexuals, you'd be drawn and quartered, and you'd deserve it!”  
Bieber tried to respond by claiming “I never said homosexuals were sick—what I said was that they had displaced sexual adjustment.”  
“That's the same thing, motherfucker!” yelled another.
It was a watershed moment.
Earlier this year, a meeting of the New York branch of the APA, a paper by Charles Socarides was interrupted by a handful of gay activists.
The long-rumored shadow organization of homosexual psychiatrists called the 'Gay-PA' is no longer in doubt. The highlight of this year's program promises to be a symposium titled “Psychiatry: Friend or Foe to Homosexuals: A Dialogue.” The panel includes Dr. Evelyn Hooker, one of the participants in last year's show down and the mysterious 'Dr. H. Anonymous,' who claims to be both a licensed psychiatrist and homosexual.
Everyone knows that a mentally ill person cannot practice psychiatry. And homosexuality is a mental illness. This Dr. H. Anonymous, if he or she is telling the truth, is risking his or her license. But yet there must be more. We all know, ever since Kinsey's famous study, that about 10% of the population identifies as primarily homosexual, while a significantly larger percentage have engaged in homosexual activity.  And ever since Hooker's paper in 1956, we know that most of this population are psychologically normal. Given the numbers attending this meeting, Dr. H. Anonymous surely can't be alone.
On the other hand, Socarides and Bieber have called Hooker and Kinsey's data into question. If they are correct, and only a small percentage of the population is homosexual, on what basis could one call it a 'normal' behavior?  Are homosexuals, as Bieber contends, individuals whose “heterosexual function is crippled, like the legs of a polio victim”? What does it mean to be 'ill' anyway?


In October of 1969, Time magazine had a cover story on the movement amongst homosexuals for greater social recognition -who they called 'inverts.' In the second paragraph, it referred to “gay” bars (with the quotations), but then proceeded to use the word “gay” without quotes. It even used the term 'gay marriage.' The article, however, made the following claim:
Most experts agree that a child will not become a homosexual unless he undergoes many emotionally disturbing experiences during the course of several years. A boy who likes dolls or engages in occasional homosexual experiments is not necessarily "queer": such activities are often a normal part of growing up. On the other hand, a child who becomes preoccupied with such interests or is constantly ill at ease with the opposite sex obviously needs some form of psychiatric counseling. While only about one-third of confirmed adult inverts can be helped to change, therapists agree that a much larger number of "prehomosexual" children can be treated successfully
Who are these 'experts' who agree? Is this another Goldwater affair?
These thoughts raise a larger specter in your mind: are psychiatry and psychology scientific?
Starting a decade ago, Thomas Szasz, Professor of Psychiatry at State University of New York Health Science Center in Syracuse, New York has been arguing, quite publicly, that 'mental illness' is a myth!  His ideas challenge the very foundation of your field.  He's listed on the program, and you're quite excited to get a chance to discuss his polemic claims in some detail.
At the same time, the President of the APA this year is something of a revolutionary himself. George Miller has been arguing for the existence of something called 'Cognitive Psychology', which directly challenges the 50-year tradition of limiting psychological research to the observation, prediction and control of human behavior. For half a century, psychologists have been convinced cannot scientifically investigate unobservable entities like 'minds', but rather must study the behavior of an organism in its environment. Now even that is being challenged!
Are psychology and psychiatry scientific?  Is there such a thing as a 'mental illness'?  Can (or should) science be used to make the world  a better place?  
Basic Principles
Academic associations like the APA not only provide their members with a forum through which they can socialize, share ideas and test or their most recent work; they also represent their discipline to the public. An association's president is often called upon to act as a spokesperson during times of controversy. The associations often define—sometimes very carefully—the qualifications someone must have to become a member.
During 1970's, the APA is being called upon to represent their membership in both of these ways.  It is important, therefore, to ensure that actions of the APA—whether it be the election of a new president or the publication of a statement—represent the will of the membership.  The association exists for the membership, not the other way around.
Reputation &amp; Replication
In academic culture, reputation is capital. But unlike other reputation-based cultures, your reputation depends entirely on the quality of data you produce, your creativity and insight in designing research, and your ability to explain the ideas in clear, simple terms.  
Disagreements are almost always professional: you can disagree vociferously with an opponent, yet respect his or her abilities as a scientist. On the flipside, those who cross the line between professional and personal disagreements run the risk of ruining both their professional and personal reputations.
At some point in your life—probably 7th grade—you were told that 'The Scientific Method' consists of creating hypotheses, designing experiments to test those hypotheses and then formulating a new hypothesis that can be tested.  But most importantly, you were probably told that scientific inquiry is distinguished from non-scientific inquiry insofar as scientific inquiry can be replicated by a stranger.  
That may be true, but notice that these claims are almost always made with the modal verb 'can.'  The sad truth is that few, if any, attempts at replicating scientific studies ever occur. The academy is not set up to encourage studies that reproduce known results. At educational institutions, tenure requirements force scientists to concentrate on producing novel results. Industries employ scientists to create new drugs, new techniques and new treatments, not to check the results of old ones. And practitioners are usually so swamped with the demands of their clientele that they may not be able to engage in research at all, let alone focus on replicating someone else's research.
All of that means that the academic culture relies heavily on reputation. It is generally assumed that academics are honest and that their results could be replicated, but will not be. Conferences, such as the APA, rely on a system of peer review to ensure that the papers presented represent the best research available.  But peer reviewers are often selected in virtue of their reputation for rigorous research and high standards. Members are elected to positions of leadership because of their reputation as psychologists or psychiatrists, not because of their knowledge of the rules of order for a public meeting. As you propose new research and present your findings at the conferences, remember that what counts is not entertainment value or charming banter, but quality of insight and rigor in data collection.
The Responsibilities of the President
While the presidency of the APA is largely an honorific position, it does come with some serious responsibilities.  It is awarded by election of the membership, according to standards known only to them. Traditionally, it has been given to significant figures in the field at the end of their careers as a kind of 'lifetime achievement' award (for example, Koffka in 1958) and advocates for new and promising avenues of research early in their careers. The first president in this game, George Miller, best exemplifies of the latter.
The President's main responsibilities include presiding over the meetings of the Board of Directors, and opening each conference with a plenary address. These addresses provide the president a huge forum to reflect on recent trends in the discipline and potential future directions.
All presidential addresses are published in the American Psychologist, which is available at Jstor.org. Potential presidents should consult the journal for examples.

            <Text>Game Play

Each week, or two sessions, of game play reenacts ones on conference of the APA in the 1970s.   The annual meeting of the APA is a huge event. There are presentations on current research, panel discussions of issues facing the discipline, administrative meetings for various committees, and publishers promoting their products.

The first session of each conference opens with a presidential address. Presidents are elected based on their reputation as researchers, but they also must have keen leadership skills and knowledge of policies and procedures of the organization's committee structure. Since these two areas of expertise do not always appear in the same person, the president is not elected directly by the membership. The membership holds an annual election for the vice-president, who is then promoted to president after a year of sitting on the executive committee and observing the inner workings of the political system.
 
The executive committee is composed of the APA President, the Vice president, and three members elected at large each serving three year terms, one expiring each year. The executive secretary, who serves without vote, is responsible for maintaining the minutes of the executive committee and taking whatever actions the committee approves during its meetings.

Events that happen at year's conference:
(1)	Executive committee meet in open session.
1.	All committees and task forces report
(2)	Executive committee meet in closed session, if necessary.
(3)	Open sessions for presenting current research.
(4)	Panel discussions on topics proposed by membership.
(5)	Election for vice president, who assumes that position at the close of that conference.
(6)	Election for member-at-large on the executive committee.
(7)	Closing remarks by current vice president, who assumes the role of president at the end of the conference.
Committee structure
The APA is overseen by an executive committee, which is responsible for maintaining the organization, and approving all official publications of the organization.  The president, who opens the conference with his or her presidential address, also serves as chair of the executive committee during that conference. The secretary of the executive committee is responsible for maintaing the minutes for that meeting and taking whatever actions are required. The membership of the executive committee is:

President
Chair of the executive committee, serving a 1-year term
Vice President – elected annually
Serves a 1-year term as Vice President, automatically promoted to President for the next year at the close of that year's annual conference
Executive secretary (preceptor), without vote

Committee member elected at large
Serving 3-year term.
Committee member elected at large
Serving 3-year term.
Committee member elected at large
Serving 3-year term.

Table 2: Terms for executive committee members
The executive committee is one of a handful of standing committees of the APA. Standing committees are permanent institutions, whose membership is elected by the membership at large. Ad Hoc (literally 'after the fact') committees are created by simple majority vote of the executive committee to generate a report on a specific problem or area of research. Usually, these are formed when the executive committee believes it has inadequate information on a specific subject. For the purposes of this game, ad hoc committees will conduct literature reviews on behalf of the executive committee. Ad hoc committees dissolve after the report is accepted by the executive committee.  

Task forces are created by the executive committee to complete a specific  task. When the executive committee creates a new task force, it gives that force a 'charge', which specifies and limits its responsibilities and powers. Like ad hoc committees, task forces disappear at the completion of their task – but unlike ad hoc committees, that task need not be the creation of a report.

The executive committee has the power to create ad hoc committees and task forces as it sees fit. The membership of those committees may be specified directly by the executive committee at the time of creation, left to the chair of the committee to decide, or even determined by popular vote of the membership.

The creation of new standing committees require a majority vote of the APA membership.

	Reading aloud

Presentations at academic conferences are evaluated by peers primarily on the basis of the content presented, not the style of presentation. While it is important to practice good public speaking skills-making eye contact with the audience, modulating one's voice, etc—getting the data right is more important than being entertaining. For that reason, this game will allow 'reading' of some presentations.   Presidential addresses should be carefully crafted general lectures. Experimental reports should highlight the data presented, and carefully articulate the structure of the experiment performed. It is also advisable to bring handouts for the membership when presenting data.
Panel discussions and presentations to the committees, however, should be delivered without a transcript. Cue cards or notes are allowed, but in these cases, the speaker must strive to make a personal connection with the audience, and hence, must not simply read a prepared speech.

Ethics committee – (add Zimbardo as a character. IF proposal is OK'd, the gamemaster can use his or her discression to allow either the student to report, or to show 'Quiet Rage'.

            <Text>Game Play

Each week (two or three sessions, depending on your schedule) of game play reenacts one annual conference of the APA in the early 1970s.  Thus, the five weeks of game play cover the years 1971-1975. These conferences are huge events. There are presentations on current research, symposia on issues facing the discipline, administrative meetings for various committees, public discussions and votes on proclamations, and publishers promoting their products.

At the beginning of each conference, each member of the APA is given one 'influence point.'  At the end of that conference, they must give it to the speaker who presented the best paper.  No player may keep these points for himself or herself. Influence points, once awarded, can be stockpiled by faction or bartered with other players. In the final vote (see 'Victory Objectives' below), the influence points can be turned into votes—although the specifics are left to the game master to decide.  

The first session of each conference opens with a presidential address. As mentioned in the previous section, the position of President is both an honorific and administrative position. The President is often elected based on his or her reputation as a researcher, but he or she also must have keen leadership skills and knowledge of the policies and procedures of the organization's committee structure. Since these two areas of expertise do not always appear in the same person, an individual is not elected directly to the presidency by the membership. Rather, the membership holds an annual election for the vice-president, who is then promoted to president after a year of sitting on the Board of Directors and observing the inner workings of the political system.
 
The Board of Directors is composed of the APA President, the Vice president, the former president and two members elected at large each of whom serving three year terms. For classes smaller than 16, the Board of Directors will be limited to the current President, the Vice President and the Former President. The executive secretary, who serves without vote, is responsible for maintaining the minutes of the Board of Directors and taking whatever actions the committee approves during its meetings.

At each year's conference, the following events occur:
(1)	Presidential Address
(2)	Board of Directors circulates proposals to be considered by the membership.
(3)	Symposia on topics proposed by membership, as scheduled by the program committee
(4)	Open sessions for presenting current research (papers or plenary addresses), as scheduled by the program committee.
(5)	Board of Directors meets in open session.
1.	All committees and task forces report
2.	Old Business (tabled from previous meeting)
3.	New Business
1.	Discussion of any proposals circulated in step (2)
2.	Create and administer ballots for proposals.
4.	Election for vice president, who assumes that position at the close of that conference
5.	Election for member-at-large on the executive committee (if necessary)
(6)	Executive committee meet in closed session, if necessary.

Game play may take many forms in the classroom. You may be questioning  the President about his or her vision for future directions in psychological or psychiatric research, engaging with or participating in a symposium with two or three of your colleagues on a contentious issue of the day, participating in research, evaluating research results, discussing proposals in committee, or even arguing about reports from task forces.  The schedule of events will be left to the Program Committee, and it is very important that they distribute the schedule early and widely. See 'Program Committee' on page 8 for more on the potential forms of conference activities.
Victory Objectives
The game normally 'ends' with a decisive vote on the definition of 'Mental Illness,' probably in 1975.  There are three basic definitions that ought to be advanced:
Advocates
Definition
APA Task Force
A Medical disorder is a relatively distinct condition resulting from an organismic dysfunction which in its fully developed or extreme form is directly and intrinsically associated with distress, disability, or certain other types of disadvantage.  The disadvantage may be of a physical, perceptual, sexual, or interpersonal nature. Implicitly there is a call for action on the part of the person who has the condition, the medical or its allied professions, and society.
A mental disorder is a medical disorder whose manifestations are primarily signs or symptoms of a psychological (behavioral) nature, or if physical, can be understood only using psychological concepts.
Behaviorists
A person can be called 'mentally ill' when he or she exhibits emotional or behavioral functioning which is so impaired as to interfere substantially with his or her capacity to function in society.
Psychoanalytic
A person is mentally ill when he or she suffers from internal conflicts that may be subconscious or unconscious, manifesting behavior that is unwanted or disturbing to the individual or the society.
Szasz
There is no 'thing' called 'mental illness,' only  sets of behaviors that may be destructive to an individual and his or her society.
 
Factional affiliation and objectives vary from individual to individual.
Influence Points and Voting
At the end of each 'conference', each member of the APA must give his or her 'influence point' to the speaker he or she believes presented the best paper. When it comes time for the final Victory Objective vote—on the final definition of mental illness—those influence points can be turned into votes.  
Special Rules
If possible, each player must serve on at least one committee at some point during the game.
Writing Tasks	
Every player will write and present at least once during the course of the game. Your role sheet should specify the specific tasks you need to complete.
A special note for data-driven writing tasks: don't say 'studies have shown that' or (in the 1st person) 'I have shown that...', show it. That will probably mean that you will have to go to the library, find the original research reports of your character, and familiarize yourself with the basic research design, as well as the relationship between the evidence presented and the thesis that evidence is reported to support. If that sounds like a great deal of effort, it should. Above all, remember that you're not writing a report on this person or position, you are playing the person and defending the position.  So don't write about  what you (as the character) believe, write as if you believe it.
Proposals
Proposals should be formal. They should be distributed to the membership at least 24 hours before a vote is called. It is usually sufficient to distribute proposals during the first session of a conference year, and hold a vote during the second (or third). Ample time for discussion should be allotted for each proposal.
Formal proposals begin by laying out the reasons for the proposal with a series of 'WHEREAS...' clauses.  It should then state the resolution. For example, in 1969, the APA resolved:
WHEREAS in many state legislature, bills have recently been introduced for the purpose of repealing or drastically modifying the existing criminal codes with respect to the termination of unwanted pregnancies;
and WHEREAS termination of unwanted pregnancies is clearly a mental health and child welfare issue, and a legitimate concern of APA;
BE IT RESOLVED that termination of pregnancy be considered a civil right of the pregnant woman, to be handled as other medical and surgical procedures in consultation with her physician, and to be considered legal if performed by a licensed physician in a licensed medical facility.
You should follow this format when drafting your proposals. Proposals in the incorrect format cannot be distributed.
Papers and Symposia
Academic conferences are opportunities to disseminate information you have gathered for your views. The method of presenting those ideas or that data, however, can vary a great deal.  The APA currently supports two kinds of presentations: Individual Reports and Symposia. The Program Committee (see below) is encouraged to experiment with new kinds of presentations, including posters, round tables, workshops, and even exhibits, if they choose. Individual Reports are talks given by a single researcher or group of researchers. Symposia are 'panel' presentations, where a group of presentations are offered on a theme or a specific problem.
The Program Committee reviews all proposals for both individual reports and symposia.  The guidelines for proposing a report are included in the official 'Call for Papers and Symposia', which follows on page 12.
Research Grants
Research grants are 1-2 page proposals specifying a research project you'd like to carry out.  These are submitted to the Research committee (see p. 7) and follow the form specified in the Call for Research Grants', which follows on page 17. If you win a research grant, you will be expected to present your findings at the next annual conference.
Reading aloud
Presentations at academic conferences are evaluated by peers primarily on the basis of the content presented, not the style of presentation. While it is important to practice good public speaking skills-making eye contact with the audience, modulating one's voice, etc.—getting the data right is more important than being entertaining. For that reason, this game will allow 'reading' of some experimental reports.  Experimental reports highlight the data presented, and carefully articulate the structure of the experiment performed. It is also advisable to bring handouts for the membership when presenting data.
Presidential addresses, however, should be carefully crafted general lectures. These should appeal to the membership of the APA, which includes many individuals from a variety of backgrounds. They should also be understandable by the general public, as the President is often seen as a spokesperson and advocate for the discipline.
Symposia and presentations to the committees, however, must be delivered without a transcript. Cue cards or notes are allowed, but in these cases, the speaker must strive to make a personal connection with the audience, and hence, must not simply read a prepared speech.
Role of the gamemaster
The gamemaster's central responsibility will be to ensure that the conferences run smoothly.  The gamemaster must therefore maintain a robust relationship with the program committee.  In a small class, the gamemaster may prefer to the responsibilities of the program committee for himself or herself.
•	Act as secretary to the Board of Directors if there is no preceptor available.
•	Remind / cajole the program committee to prepare the schedule at least 48 hours in advance of each class.
•	Maintain the election cycle (see the table in the instructor's manual)
•	Distribute research reports were appropriate.

Committee structure
The APA is overseen by a Board of Directors, which is responsible for maintaining the organization, and approving all official public proclamations and publications of the organization.  The president, who opens the conference with his or her presidential address, also serves as chair of the Board of Directors during that conference. The secretary of the Board of Directors is responsible for maintaining the minutes for that meeting and implementing whatever policy decisions are required.

Responsibilities of the Board of Directors:
•	Issue public proclamations.
•	Maintain official publications, such as the DSM
•	Create ad-hoc committees and task forces, as necessary.
•	Oversee and receive reports from the standing committees.


 The membership of the Board of Directors is:

President
Chair of the Board of Directors, serving a 1-year term
Vice-president – elected annually
Serves a 1-year term as Vice-president, automatically promoted to President for the next year at the close of that year's annual conference
Former President
Serves a 1-year term after their service as the chair of the Board of Directors.
Executive secretary (preceptor), without vote

Committee member elected at large*
Serving 3-year term.

Table 3: Terms for Board of Directors members     *only used for classes &gt;16
The Board of Directors is one of a handful of standing committees of the APA. Standing committees are permanent institutions, whose membership is elected by the membership at large. Ad hoc (literally 'after the fact') committees or 'task forces' are created by simple majority vote of the Board of Directors and are tasked with generating a report on a specific problem or area of research. Usually, these are formed when the Board of Directors believes it has inadequate information on a specific subject. For the purposes of this game, ad hoc committees will conduct literature reviews on behalf of the Board of Directors and report to the membership. Ad hoc committees disband after the report is accepted by the Board of Directors.  
The Board of Directors has the power to create ad hoc committees or task forces as it sees fit. The membership of those committees may be specified directly by the Board of Directors at the time of creation, left to the chair of the newly created committee to decide, or even determined by popular vote of the membership. That decision is left to the Board of Directors.
Unlike the creation of ad hoc committees or task forces, the creation of new permanent standing committees require a majority vote of the APA membership, not just the Board of Directors. A full proposal for such a committee, specifying its membership structure, voting procedures, rights and responsibilities should be distributed to the membership at least 48 hours before the vote. Dissolving a standing committee requires a majority vote of the membership.
The Board of Directors represents the membership, it does not act in opposition.  It is incredibly important, then, that the Board seeks approval from the membership as a whole at every turn.  The Board is a capable of assigning duties to various subcommittees on its own, but all matters of policy should be turned over to the membership for an up or down vote.
Standing Committees
In addition to the Board of Directors, there are currently three standing committees of the APA. All standing committees report directly to the Board of Directors annually.  All standing committees have the right to request an open session at the general conference for whatever they wish. If they want to initiate a vote by membership, however, they must file a request with the Board of Directors. If the Board of Directors approves the request, the standing committee can administer a vote.
Research Committee
The research committee is charged with distributing grants to fund research as well as enforcing the APA's Ethical Standards in the practice of Psychology and Psychiatry (see Appendix 7). The Research committee should solicit proposals in the form of a 'Call for Research Grants' that specifies both the deadline for submissions, as well as the time frame for reviewing submissions. The Research Committee should revise the enclosed 'Call for Research Grants' on p. 17 to suit their needs.

In the context of the game, winning a grant entitles the bearer to access the student body for a period of one class session, during which time he or she can perform his or her approved research project. After that period, the grantee will be expected to present his or her findings to the membership as a conference paper / report.

The Research committee should take great care in considering the scientific value of each proposal. The APA does not want to be seen supporting poor or biased research! As such, members of the Research committee are strongly advised to carefully consult the 'Error! Reference source not found.' on p. Error! Bookmark not defined. as well as the 'Error! Reference source not found., on p. Error! Bookmark not defined. of the gamebook.

The Research committee is also charged with hearing and ultimately ruling on charges of ethical transgression. It alone has the power to censure a member of the APA. And because these powers apply equally to all members, including those sitting on the Board of Directors, this power can be exercised without approval by the Board of Directors.

 The Board of Directors should hold an election each year for a new member of the Research committee.  

Members of the Research committee in 1971:
L. Tyler (expiring 1972)
K. Clark (expiring 1973)
J. Marmor (expiring 1974)
Nomenclature Committee
The Nomenclature committee is charged with maintaining the official terminology of psychology and psychiatry.  This is embodied by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, which is the definitive source for definitions and classifications of mental disorders.  It determines who can be diagnosed with what, what treatments are considered responsible and what disorders will be covered by medical insurance. If a condition does not appear in the DSM, psychiatrists cannot treat patients with that condition. Given the increasing importance of health insurance in the 1970s, it is vital to have a standardized diagnostic system to support billable treatments.

Members of the nomenclature committee serve for six years.

Members of the nomenclature committee are strongly advised to carefully consult the 'Error! Reference source not found.,' starting on p. Error! Bookmark not defined. of the gamebook.

Members of the nomenclature committee in 1971:
G. Albee (expiring 1972)
J. Spiegel (expiring 1974)
R. Spitzer (expiring 1976)

Program Committee
The Program Committee is charged with scheduling the conferences. The committee must remember that each conference opens with a public address from the sitting president, and each standing committee has the right to a session at each conference. Not all the standing committees will make use of that time, but each should be approached before the schedule is drawn up.
Proposals for symposia and presentations should be solicited from the general population. The committee meets in closed session (i.e. after class) to determine the conference schedule after reviewing all of the materials submitted. It is vitally important that the symposia and papers accepted represent the highest standard for academic work. They should be judged by that standard alone, not with respect to theoretical commitment or viewpoint. The conference schedule should be made available to the membership at least 48 hours before the conference begins (i.e. by Friday evening before a new conference).
The Program Committee is composed of three members, each of which serve three year terms. Hence, the Board of Directors must hold an election for a new member every year.
The schedule for the conference is set by the 'Program Committee', but there are a number of business events that must take place each year. These are outlined in Table 4.

The VP immediately becomes the president: so while Bandura vacates the position of VP at the end of the conference in 1971, he becomes President at that moment.  The election in 1971 is for the VP of 1972, who will be President in 1973.

Definitions used by the APA
The following are quoted from current websites of the American Psychological Association and the American Psychiatric Association.
Definition of "psychologist"
APA policy on the use of the title "psychologist" is contained in the General Guidelines for Providers of Psychological Services, which define the term "Professional Psychologist" as follows:
Psychologists have a doctoral degree in psychology from an organized, sequential program in a regionally accredited university or professional school.
The APA is not responsible for the specific title or wording of any particular position opening, but it is general pattern to refer to master's-level positions as counselors, specialists, clinicians, and so forth (rather than as "psychologists"). In addition, it is general practice to refer to APA accredited programs as "APA-accredited" rather than "APA approved." The position as described must be in conformity with the statute regulating the use of the title psychologist and the practice of psychology in the state in which the job is available.
Definition of "psychology"
Psychology is the study of the mind and behavior. The discipline embraces all aspects of the human experience — from the functions of the brain to the actions of nations, from child development to care for the aged. In every conceivable setting from scientific research centers to mental health care services, "the understanding of behavior" is the enterprise of psychologists.
Definition of “psychiatrist”
A psychiatrist is a physician who specializes in the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of mental illnesses and substance use disorders. It takes many years of education and training to become a psychiatrist: He or she must graduate from college and then medical school, and go on to complete four years of residency training in the field of psychiatry. (Many psychiatrists undergo additional training so that they can further specialize in such areas as child and adolescent psychiatry, geriatric psychiatry, forensic psychiatry, psychopharmacology, and/or psychoanalysis.) This extensive medical training enables the psychiatrist to understand the body's functions and the complex relationship between emotional illness and other medical illnesses. The psychiatrist is thus the mental health professional and physician best qualified to distinguish between physical and psychological causes of both mental and physical distress.


Call for Papers and Symposia
 Introduction
 I.	The Program committee herein announces a Call of Papers and Symposia for the annual convention of the APA. Please read the relevant rules carefully if you plan to take part in the program. Note especially the deadlines, the form for abstracts of contributed papers, the forms for symposium proposals, and the proper persons to receive your correspondence. The pertinent references have been collected into the box on this page for your convenience.
This year will begin with a plenary address by the President. Current plans allow for 2 individual reports and 1 symposium.  The Board of Directors will meet in open session to hear proposals from the membership.
 Kinds of Programs and Sessions
The meetings regularly contain many kinds of programs and sessions, including research papers, symposia, group discussions, addresses, business meetings, and film sessions, as well as other events, such as reunions, dinners, social hours and the like. In general, requests for information should be submitted to the Program Committee.
The APA Program Committee has full responsibility for the conference program. Persons planning to submit proposals that fall outside the lines outlined herein should consult with the chairman of the APA Program Committee for special instructions.
The chairman of the APA Program Committee should also receive all requests for scheduling of nonsubstantive program activities such as reunions, dinners, social hours, headquarters space, luncheons, and the like. To insure publication in the program all requests must be received by the close of business on the Friday before a conference.
 Who may participate
 Volunteered Papers
 Any member of the APA may read a paper, provided that it has been accepted by the program committee.
 A nonmember of the APA
may read a paper provided that he is sponsored by a member of the  APA and provided that his qualifications and the quality of his paper are acceptable to the program committee. The APA member who agrees to sponsor a nonmember must submit the abstract of the nonmember's paper to the chairman of the program committee with an accompanying description of the nonmember's scientific qualifications plus the names of recognized scientific societies in which the nonmember holds membership.
 Symposia and invited addresses
The program committee may invite distinguished nonmembers to contribute to the program as special speakers or as participants in symposia. Because symposia often involve topics extending beyond the competence of APA members, it is frequently desirable to include nonmembers as participants.  Acceptance of a distinguished speaker or of a symposium proposal by the Program Committee constitutes the require sponsorship of nonmember participants.
 Limits of Individual Participation
Over the past several years the APA's Board of Directors working with the program committee has developed several ground rules for the limits of individual participation in the annual convention program. These rules were designed to ensure the widest possible participation by APA members and also to prevent troublesome conflicts in the time schedule. Briefly, the rules have been that each member may present no more than one volunteered paper and that each member may, in addition, participate in no more than one additional session such as a symposium, discussion group, and the like. It is still strongly recommended that maximum participation be limited to one symposium or discussion group plus one paper.
 Individual Reports
Unless otherwise indicated, four ten-minute papers will be scheduled for each 50-minute session. In instances of multiple authorship the person whose name is listed first will be expected to present the paper.
A paper previously read at the Annual APA Convention may not be read again, unless it is a substantial elaboration (additional findings, etc.). Two papers which report highly similar findings from a cooperative project may not be read at the convention.
The APA Board of Directors have voted that, for reasons of economy, this rule should be followed: Abstracts printed in the American Psychologist are limited to 100 words. However, it is recognized that more detailed information will be needed by the Program Committee for use in the selection of papers.  The procedures for research reports and other individual reports are described below.
 Research Reports
Each author of a research report must submit a 100-word abstract (1 copy) for publication if the paper is accepted, and also a 300-word summary (4 copies) for committee publication.  If the author desires, tables presenting results may be submitted with the 300-word summary. Not more than one page of tables should be submitted. This means that all the data should have been obtained and the analysis completed at the time the abstract and summary are submitted to the Program Committee.
 Other individual reports
Theoretical papers, case studies, and the like are perfectly acceptable for the program.  The 100-word abstract of a non-experimental paper must, however, be accompanied by a manuscript of the complete paper in draft form. The complete manuscript is required in order that the Program Committee may be in a better position to judge the contribution to the program.
 Form of abstracts and summaries
All abstracts and summaries must be typed on one side of the paper only, double-spaced throughout and on 8 1/2” X 11” paper.
 The 100-word abstract
The purpose of the published abstract is to provide information concerning the psychological relevance of the paper. .. primarily to justify its scientific validity. Hence abstracts should be concerned with content … rather than with method and technique unless the purpose of the paper is essentially methodological). Examples of good short abstracts from many different fields may be found in Psychological Abstracts.
Abstracts must be limited in length to 100 words (not counting title, author and institution). Longer abstracts will not be printed but will be listed by title only. Abstracts should not contain tables, drawings, footnotes, or bibliographic entries, as such material will not be printed.
The following outline should be followed in preparing the abstract:
Title of Paper:
Author(s):				Sponsor (if any):
Institution(s):
     Text of abstract (not to exceed 100 words)
Because the 100-word abstract will be sent to the printer, do not underline or type anything with all capital letters. The type written abstract should be checked and proofread carefully, since it will be printed in the form in which it is submitted.  Authors are urged to give careful thought to the visual aides that will best facilitate presentations of their data.  If slides are used, members are urged to consider presenting graphic and tabular material on paper.  As a new procedure, authors of accepted papers will be asked to indicate their preference for audio-visual support.
 The 300-word summary
The text of the summary will normally include a statement of the problem, subjects used, procedure, results and conclusions.
Summaries must be limited in length to 300 words (not counting title, author, and institution). The 300-word summary may be accompanied by not more than one page of supplementary tables, drawings, footnotes, etc.
The form for submitting the 300-word summary should be exactly the same as for the 100-word abstract except, of course, for the longer text.
Four copies of the 300-word summary and the supplementary tables, etc. are required. Author, sponsor, and institution should appear on the first copy only. The first copy is the one that will be used by the Program Committee Chair in the creation of the Conference Proceedings. The other three copies without identifying data will be used by the Program Committee for judging the acceptability of the paper.
 Where to send abstracts and summaries
Copies of the abstract and summary of a volunteered paper should be sent to the chair of the Program Committee.
 Symposia
A symposium provides for several prepared papers on a single theme or problem. It is an excellent form of meeting if the aim is to bring to an audience several diverse or even contradictory views, presented by a number of “experts.” The expectation would be that all papers would first be read; then there would be a substantial period for interchanging of views among the speakers (and invited discussants, if desired); finally, a brief period for questions or points raised from the floor. It is important to plan the time so that there is real interaction among participants after the papers. In order to realize the unique value of the symposium the chairman should select speakers at an early date, arrange for the participants to exchange papers ell in advance of the session, and ensure that ample time is allotted for discussion among the participants and contributors from the audience
 Initiation of symposia
Any member of the APA may suggest a symposium topic to the chairman of the Program Committee. Such proposals must be made at an early date as a successful symposium requires much planning and correspondence. A member may also submit a fully organized symposium for the Program Committee's consideration.
 Form of symposium proposals
 Suggestions to the Program Committee
When a member only suggests but does not organize a symposium, he should indicate the title of the topic for discussion, comment on the significance of the topic, and list the names and addresses of the proposed chairman and other participants. Such suggestions should be sent to the appropriate divisional program chairman well in advance of the deadline to allow for ample time for planning.
 Member-Organized symposia
A member may organize a proposed symposium in complete detail and present it for approval to the Program Committee. Each such proposal should indicate the title of the symposium and list the names of the chairman and participants, together with the titles of participants' contributions, if these titles are to be published. Five copies of the completed symposium plans must be submitted to the Program Committee by the deadline.
 Symposia organized by the Program Committee
Symposia may be organized independently by the Program Committee or in response to the requests of members.
 Special Programs
The Program Committee should feel free to try new kinds of programs.  Forums, discussion groups, panels, round tables, conferences, and workshops are often valuable alternatives to papers and symposia. Members are invited to send suggestions for new types of programs to the Program Committee. Special sessions should be suggested well in advance of the deadline to allow for ample time for planning. Procedures for initiating special programs should follow in general the procedures for initiating symposia.
 Miscellaneous Meetings and Special Sessions
APA boards, committees, etc. desiring business meetings must send to the Chairman of the APA Program Committee by the deadline a statement of estimated attendance, time required, time and day preferred and whether arrangements for luncheon and dinner are desired.
Luncheons, dinners and social hours may be scheduled for non-APA organizations if they send their request to the chairman of the APA Program Committee by the deadline.  Such scheduled events will be listed in the condensed program.
 Audio-Visual Presentations
APA members, commercial film producers or distributors who wish to present new films, film strips, or other audio-visual aids (including sound recordings) should make the Program Committee aware of this fact at the deadline.  The committee will review and select the audio-visual materials which are to be presented as part of the APA program.
 Exhibits
APA members are encouraged to exhibit apparatus, teaching aids, and other materials of scientific and applied interest. Commercial agencies are invited to request arrangements for exhibits. All commercial exhibitors will be charged for space. Those wishing to arrange for exhibits must write to the chairman of the Program Committee.

Call for Research Grants
Introduction
The Research Committee of the APA herein solicits proposals for research that will forward the disciplines of psychology and psychiatry. Note especially the deadlines, the form for abstracts of contributed papers, the forms for symposium proposals, and the proper persons to receive your correspondence. The pertinent references have been collected into the box on this page for your convenience.
Winners will be granted the support of the other members of the class for a period of one class session. The primary investigator must specify in the research proposal how the other students will participate: as subjects, participants, observers or confederates.
Winning grants will be determined by the Research Committee, in accordance with the criteria specified herein.  All proposals must be in line with the APA's ethical guidelines which are in force at the time of submission.
Research Supported
The APA seeks to advance the creation, communication and application of knowledge of the mind and behavior to benefit society and improve people's lives. The APA embraces scientific inquiry into all aspects of the human experience — from the functions of the brain to the actions of nations, from child development to care for the aged. And in every conceivable setting from scientific research centers to mental health care services, "the understanding of behavior" is the enterprise of psychologists.
Additionally, the APA aspires to advance the understanding of psychology and psychiatry as scientific disciplines. To that end, it will support any research that follows the standards of scientific inquiry and contributes to the central goals of the association.
It is imperative that all research supported by the APA must be accordance with the ethical guidelines published by the APA.  
Who May Submit Proposals
Members of the APA
Any member of the APA may submit a proposal for a research grant.  APA membership is limited to those meeting the definition of 'Psychologist' or 'Psychiatrist' used by the APA (see p. 10 of the gamebook).
Nonmembers of the APA
As the APA Research committee seeks to further the disciplines of Psychology and Psychiatry wherever they are practiced, the primary investigator of a grant need ot be a member of the APA. The primary investigator, however, must be a Psychologist or Psychiatrist as defined by the APA (see p. 10 of the gamebook).
Confederates, Observers and Assistants
Individuals working in psychological research should be engaged in some significant way with the academic pursuit of knowledge. Confederates, observers and assistants in research must therefore be students of psychology or psychiatry, if not psychologists or psychiatrists in their own right.
Limitations of Participation
A primary investigator may submit one (1) proposal annually. An individual may serve as a consultant, confederate, observer or assistant on any number of grant proposals in addition to proposing himself as a primary investigator.   
Form of the Proposal
Form of the Proposal
Introduction
Limited to 100 words, the introduction should specify the phenomenon you wish to examine and why. Briefly describe the phenomenon in general, and discuss how it relates to the study of the human mind and behavior.

Main Factions
Players represent three factions with different perspectives on not only the nature of scientific inquiry into the human mind, but the object of those studies themselves.  A number of independents, representing a variety of academic disciplines, complement these three factions.
It should be noted that unlike some other reacting games, individuals in these factions are not bound to think or vote the same way on the central issues in the game. The factions represent high-level agreement on the nature of the science of the mind, there is almost complete disagreement on all other issues. In fact, when it comes to actual game play, you might find that your votes are more aligned with members of other factions than your own.
Psychoanalysts
Psychoanalysts are split in the classical (Freudian), Jungian and unspecified.  The game contains a number of independent psychiatrists who, while they are familiar with psychoanalysis, are not professed members of the faction.
Classical
Classical psychoanalysis can be summarized by five basic hypotheses:
1.	First, psychoanalysts hold that the mind is composed of entities in conflict, also known as the hypothesis of intrapsychic conflict or dynamic hypothesis. In classic Freudianism, the hypothesis followed “the discovery of the unconscious” by Breuer and Freud in 1895 (see Error! Reference source not found. on page Error! Bookmark not defined.). Traumatic event or fantasies can leave a subject with memories that are unacceptable to the conscious awareness. The conscious awareness defends itself by suppressing the traumatic event in the unconscious by means of repression (see, e.g. Introductory Lectures on Psychoanalysis, p. 82, 94 also p. 438). This hypothesis is sometimes called the psychodynamic hypothesis.
2.	Second, psychoanalysis posits that there is a finite amount of psychic energy available to any given individual. This forms the Economic hypothesis of classical psychoanalysis (See Freud, Introductory Lectures, p. 26 and 436-7 for the thesis that psychic energy is sexual; p. 340, 442-3 and 466for an explicit statement. It also appears in On the Interpretation Dreams, Ch7). The activities of the mind are “costly,” and hence the mind will optimize its function for the most efficient option.
3.	The topographical hypothesis is Freud's most well known:  the mind composed of three basic kinds of thoughts: conscious thoughts, pre-conscious thoughts and unconscious thoughts. The term 'thoughts' here is used broadly, to include wishes, desires, fears, emotions, etc. Conscious thoughts are those of which we are aware. Pre-conscious thoughts, are not currently conscious, but are readily available to consciousness. The memory of your last birthday, for example, is probably pre-conscious, not unconscious. Unconscious thoughts, which far outnumber the other two categories, are unavailable to consciousness. All these thoughts, however, originate in experience: there is nothing in the unconscious store that is not linked in some way to that individual's past experiences. (see, e.g. Introductory lectures, p. 25)
4.	Fourth, the genetic hypothesis claims that human behavior is best explained in terms of the original conditions that cause it. In Freud's theory, the genetic hypothesis takes the form of his theory of infantile sexuality.
For Freud, all behavior ultimately originates in sexual desire. To summarize briefly: Freud hypothesized that sexual drive, the main source of psychic energy, is present from birth. He is explicit in using the term 'sexual' here, but it is sometimes easier to understand if we use a softer term like 'using one's body for pleasure.' Freud repeated argues for infantile sexuality by pointing out the noncontroversial pleasure children take in tickling or cuddling, but we wouldn't necessarily call these 'sexual' today. Freud, somewhat to his determinate, insisted on the term 'sexual' even despite these kind of objections.
This drive towards physical gratification takes various forms throughout our lives, moving through the oral phase to the anal phase to the phallic stage. If the internal drives are left unfulfilled, or the internal conflicts unresolved (which is really two ways of saying the same thing), neurotic behavior results.
5.	Psychoanalysts differ with respect to the entities that comprise the mind, but most recognize Freud's basic structural hypothesis: the mind is functionally divided between the id, the ego and the superego (see Introductory Lectures, p. 365). The id, which is totally unconscious, contains the representations of sexual and aggressive instinctual drives. The ego regulates and controls the desires of the id in relation to the demands of the external world, which are internalized as the superego. The ego follows the economic hypothesis, in seeking to maximize gratification of the instinctual desires while minimizing the amount of psychic energy spent in that process. It achieves this end through the use of various mechanisms of representation and repression (sometimes called 'defense mechanisms'):
•	Repression: The first mechanism proposed by Freud (Breuer and Freud), the ego banishes or precludes an idea or feeling from conscious awareness.
•	Isolation: Ideas are split off from their associated feelings (affect) and presented as alien or foreign in origin.
•	Reaction formation: replacing the unacceptable desire with its symbolic opposite.
•	Displacement: unacceptable wishes are removed from their original objects and moved to an acceptable, or at least not-unacceptable one.
•	Projection: an unacceptable idea or desire is attributed to someone else.
•	Undoing: painful or unacceptable ideas are minimized by overdoing some opposite action in some opposite arena.
•	Turning against the self:  the original object of an unpleasant desire (usually hate) is replaced with the self.
•	Denial: the individual remains unaware of certain aspects of reality that would be painful to recognize.
•	Rationalization: the individual convinces himself or herself that their behavior has a logical, reasonable, or at least neutral, explanation in order to avoid the unacceptable cause.
•	Identification: usually found during development, a child becomes like another person (usually a parent) in order to deal with separation or loss of a love-object.
These conflicts can be discovered by studying the mechanisms of representation that are used to obfuscate and repress traumatic experiences and latent desires.  The mechanisms of representation take the object represented (the 'latent content') and replace it with a representation (the 'manifest content'). The relationship between these two can be one of:
•	part to whole: the latent content is fragmented and represented in isolation. (Introductory Lectures, p. 147)
•	allusion: the latent content is represented by, in Freud's words “a caption, as it were, or an abbreviation in telegraphic style.” (Introductory Lectures, p. 148)
•	plastic portrayal: the latent content is replaced with a plastic, concrete portrayal of it, taking its cue from the superficial aspects of the latent content. For example, the editor of a 'Survey' may be represented in a dream as a 'surveyor'. (Introductory Lectures, p.149)
•	symbolism: symbols are stable translations of one object into another. The relation between the object symbolized (the latent content) and the object that does the symbolization (the manifest content) is stable in an individual, but may not be stable between individuals. But it is always true that the latent content and manifest content share something in common. It is the task of the psychoanalysts, through the techniques of free association and manipulating transference reactions, to discover the common factors between the latent and manifest content, and hence reveal the symbolic relationships. (Introductory Lectures, p. 185)
	(see Introductory lectures on psychoanalysis,  Lecture VII-X)
By revealing these relationships to the subject of psychoanalysis, the ego becomes aware of latent trauma and hence can deal with it in healthy ways, removing the conflict and obviating the neurosis.
Interpsychic conflict is a part of the normal maturation of a healthy adult mind. Neurosis and Psychosis occur, therefore, when this development goes wrong in some important way. Development can go awry through inhibition or regression (see Introductory Lectures, Ch 22-23).  In 'inhibition', portions of function of the ego are held back from development, often because it becomes fixated on a particular libidnal instinct.  In 'regression' an ego that has progressed further than a given developmental stage returns to that stage was a kind of defense mechanism.
The terms 'neurosis' and 'psychoneurosis':
 “refer to a class of psychiatric illnesses characterized by prominent symptoms that have no significant somatic origin. The symptoms include disturbances of feelings (anxiety, depression, guilt), disturbances of thought (obsessions), and disturbances of behavior (compulsions and phobic inhibitions), all of which are experienced as alien to the comfort and well-being of the individual” (American Handbook of Psychiatry, p. 737-738)
Neurosis, then, is explained when the conflict between the desires of the id and the defense mechanisms of the ego go awry: (1) the ego's defense mechanism leaves the drive unfulfilled, (2) the defense mechanism imposes a disguised or symbolic form onto the original drive in order to hide it from the consciousness, and (3) the superego imposes some suffering as punishment for the self-denial, such a guilt.
Psychosis occurs when the id constructs its own reality and imposes it on the ego. The subject can no longer function in normal life—he or she may be beset by hallucinations, persistent delusions, wild mood swings, visual and auditory agnosia, amnesia, etc. It is worth noting that unlike neuroses, psychoses may be the result of organic brain syndromes or other physical conditions. Psychoses not associated with physical conditions include schizophrenia, affective disorders and other reactions.
As the id is the source of psychic energy, unacceptable drives using one of the mechanisms above will not remain repressed forever. As unacceptable drives gain in strength and threaten to reveal themselves, a number of reactions are possible (see Introductory Lectures, Ch. 19):
•	Anxiety reaction: a chronic, free-floating anxiety which may have periods of acute anxiety. Typified by feelings of helplessness; although symptoms include phobias, obsessions, compulsions and depression. It is caused by the failure of all the defenses to keep the unacceptable instinctual drives in stable control. (Introductory Lectures, Ch. 25, p. 452)
•	phobic reaction: typified by one or more prominent phobias: and extreme anxiety focused on an ordinary place, object or situation.  The mechanism of displacement moves the anxiety associated with the unacceptable drive to a neutral place, object or situation, which then is allowed to flourish unchecked by the defense mechanisms of the ego. (Introductory Lectures, p. 495-498)
•	conversion reaction: what used to be called 'hysteria', it can manifest itself in many symptoms, including spasms, temporary paralysis, visual or auditory agnosia, weakness, shortness of breath, pains, etc. It results when the unacceptable instinctual drive is 'converted' into apparently physical symptoms. (Introductory Lectures, p. 485, 497-8)
•	obsessive-compulsive reaction: the patient is troubled by persistent thoughts that are usually painful in nature. These obsessional thoughts interfere in some important way with the patient's ability to engage in a meaningful adult life: i.e. intellectually, sexually, socially or professionally. Anxiety at not following through on an obsessional thought, which often manifests as repeated actions regarding some mundane object, can be severe and often is only revealed by completion of the mundane task in question. (Introductory Lectures, Ch. 17)
As an example, classical psychoanalysis holds that obsessive-compulsive reaction can be traced to unresolved conflicts in the anal stage of development, where frustration at potty-training is turned into rage towards one's mother. That rage, in turn, is found to be unacceptable by the ego and repressed through one of the standard mechanisms creating obsessions with objects or scenarios that are symbolically linked to the original frustration. The particular object of obsession is essentially random, as the subject latches onto some mundane object present at the time of the frustration. The choice of obsessional object, however, can provide clues as to the true cause of the frustration, as it is invariably linked, through one of the mechanisms of representation, to the true object. The compulsive aspect of this conditions is an 'acceptable' outlet for the unacceptable rage towards one's mother.  Psychoanalysts go on to hold that obsessive-compulsive is often unconsciously aware of his or her rage and may take extreme steps to avoid losing control when provoked.  
Psychoanalytic Treatment.
Psychoanalysis—the process of psychoanalytic treatment—aims at resolving unresolved conflicts that cause neurosis. The psychoanalyst seeks to align the psychic forces within the individual so that they are no longer in conflict. A psychoanalyst must keep all five psychoanalytic hypotheses—the topographical, dynamic, economy, genetic and structural—in mind during treatment, but in practice, tends to focus on one or two at a time.  
Classical psychoanalysis makes use of two basic techniques: free association and manipulating transference reactions. In free association, the psychoanalyst removes himself or herself from the patients line of sight (hence the standard couch with the psychoanalyst seated behind the patients' head), and asks the patient to say whatever comes to mind when prompted regardless of logic, order or social constraint. In a relaxed state, it is theorized, these free-associations will reveal the connections between ideas that, when analyzed, explain the relationships this particular patient uses to represent latent content with manifest content.
Freud is often naively criticized for insisting on universal symbolic relationships: cigars always represent penises, for example. But this simply isn't true: classical psychoanalysis is 'empirical' in the sense that there is nothing in the mind that was not put there from experience.  The symbolic relationships found in a patient have built up by that patient, based on his or her unique experiences. Where commonalities occur between patients, they are at the level of the language (i.e. symbolic relationships that originate from homophones in German would not be found in an English-speaking patient) or culture (i.e. shared mythology). So while a cigar may represent a penis because of its shape to some, it may represent excrement because of its color to others.
Transference reactions are inappropriate reactions in which the patient reacts to a person or object in the present as if it were a person or object from the past (see Introductory Lectures, Ch. 27). Transference is, in Freud's terms, a 'repetition,' a reliving of an event, relationship, emotion, attitude, etc. with a substitute person or object. Transference can be a very powerful tool for the psychoanalyst, especially when the object that is the source of the unresolved conflict can be projected onto a substitute, and the patient allowed to address the object directly. If a patient's neurosis originates in unresolved anger towards his dead father, substituting a inanimate object for that father can allow the patient to exorcise the anger and hence dissolve the neurosis. Since Freud's masterwork Dora, many psychoanalysts have held transference to be the primary tool of psychoanalysis.
In order for transference to work, however, the patient must be willing and capable of suspending his or her 'ego' and regressing to the state where he or she really believes that the substitute is the original source of the conflict. As psychotics live in a state where experienced reality is formed by the psychic desire not reality itself; psychotics are not suitable candidates for treatment via transference.
Throughout treatment, the psychoanalysts must be aware of resistance.  Resistance is the patient's opposition to treatment. It defends the status quo by maintaining the neurosis or psychosis. Resistance may be conscious, subconscious or pre-conscious. It may hinder or misdirect free association. It may distract via inappropriate and unhelpful transference reactions. It may adapt to novel situations and invent new strategies. As Freud himself said “The resistance accompanies the treatment step by step. Every single association, every act of the person under treatment must reckon with the resistance and represents a compromise between the forces that are striving towards recovery and the opposing ones.” (1912, p. 11).
The psychoanalytic treatment can then be broken down into four basic steps:
1.	Confrontation. The first step in psychoanalysis: the patient's conscious ego must be made aware that there is a problem.  
2.	Clarification: The problem is put into sharp focus. Often, this process works with the previous, as minor conflicts give way to greater conflicts.
3.	Interpretation: The process of bringing the unconscious conflict into consciousness.
4.	Working through: the progressive elaboration of resistance mechanisms as they manifest.
There are, of course, many more complications that occur in any single patient's psychoanalytic treatment, but these four basic steps are almost universally recognized.
When embarking on a new treatment, then, the psychoanalyst has three basic aims:
1.	To translate the productions of the patient into their unconscious antecedents. The patient's thoughts, fantasies, feelings, behavior, and impulses have to be traced to their unconscious predecessors.
2.	The unconscious elements must be synthesized into meaningful insights. Fragments of past and present history, conscious and unconscious, must be connected so as to give a sense of continuity and coherence in terms of the patient's life.
3.	The insight so obtained must be communicable to the patient. As one listens one must ascertain what uncovered material will be constructively utilizable by the patient. (quoting from the American Handbook of Psychiatry , p. 779)
Adler
INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK FOR THE TIME BEING
Jung
Jungian psychoanalysis is distinguished from classical psychoanalysis by two major shifts in the basic theory.
1.	Jungian psychoanalysis holds that the subconscious contains psychical elements that do not originate in the experiences of the individual being psychoanalyzed.  As mentioned previously, classical psychoanalysis is empirical about the mind (for an explanation of that tradition, see Error! Reference source not found. p. Error! Bookmark not defined.), holding that the mind comes into the world as a blank slate (tabla rasa), and is progressively filled by experiences. The contents of the unconscious must therefore be traceable to discrete experiences in the individual's life. And it is the task of psychoanalysis to discover those experiences.  
Jungian psychoanalysts believe they have evidence of unconscious contents that are not explainable by the experiences of the individual. Thus, they hypothesize the existence of a deeper 'collective unconscious' that is composed of 'archetypes' that inform and structure the content of both the unconscious as well as our conscious lives.
2.	Second, on a related note, Jungian psychoanalysis extends the genetic hypothesis from Freud's insistence that all psychic energy was sexual energy to include sexual energy as just one of many sources of psychic energy.
For example, Freud originally posited that neurosis originated in traumatic experience in childhood on the basis of self-reports of his case-study patients. He ultimately came to realize, however, that these self-reports were fictionalizations, theorizing that the  true cause of his patient's neurosis lay in their infantile fixations. Once again, Jung extends Freud's insight to allow for fixations throughout life. He argues that:
3.	..the moment of the outbreak of neurosis is not just a matter of chance; as a rule it is most critical. It is usually the moment when a new psychological adjustment, that is, a new adaptation, is demanded. Such moments facilitate the outbreak of a neurosis, as every experienced neurologist knows.
This fact seems to me extremely significant. If the fixation were indeed real we should expect to find its influence constant: in other words, a neurosis lasting throughout life. This is obviously not the case. The psychological determination of a neurosis is only partly due to an early infantile predisposition; it must be due to some cause in the present as well. (The Essential Jung, 49 “Psychoanalysis and Neurosis”)
That leads to the general proposition that Freud's identification of sexual desire as the origin of neurosis was far too narrow. Sexual desire is one of the pleasurable instincts that shape our psychology, but for Jung, “psychoanalytic theory should be freed from the purely sexual standpoint. In place of it I should like to introduce an energetic viewpoint into the psychology of neurosis” (ibid, p. 50).
Jung hypothesizes that the libidinal energies naturally increased when faced with an obstacle, in order to overcome it through adaptation. When that obstacle is too great, the libido retreats and regresses, and the patient reverts to a more primitive “mode of adaptation.” The practice of psychoanalysis is the same, however, as Jung theorizes that the energy that the patient needs to overcome the present obstacle and become healthy is attached to these sexual fixations. By bringing past frustrations and maladaptations to light through psychoanalysis, the libidinal energy is free to return to the present-day task: adaptation to overcome the current obstacle.
The task of a psychoanalyst, then, is not only to discover the original traumatic cause of a neurosis, probably buried deep in childhood, but to discover the current obstacle that is perceived as being insurmountable. Jung agrees with Freud that the childhood fixations determine the form of neurosis, but unlike Freud holds that they cannot be considered the immediate cause of neurosis.
The difference between practice among the psychoanalytic approaches is emphasis, not technique. As J.B. Wheelwright noted in 1963, “Freud focused on sexuality, Adler focused on power, and Jung focused on growth, which he called individuation.” (quoted in American Handbook of Psychiatry, p. 817)

Behaviorists
Behaviorism holds that psychology is properly limited to the observation, prediction and control of behavior. It  typified by four hypotheses:
1.	Internal entities are neither the object of scientific study nor explanatorily relevant to psychology. Behaviorism begins with the deceptively simply insight that while psychoanalytic explanations are framed in terms of psychic entities (ego, id, etc.), quantities (psychic energy) and interactions (the mechanisms of repression), what all psychological theories seek to explain is behavior. These psychic entities, and the massive vocabulary that is required to discuss them, are all hypothetical, posited for the sake of explaining why people behave the way they do. Moreover, psychoanalytic hypotheses require a sharp dividing line between human behavior and animal behavior, which is not born out by empirical observation.
To be scientific, then, psychology must limit itself to observable behavior. The discourse of psychology as a scientific discipline is restricted to those terms that denote observable variables: behavior and environmental conditions, not internal mental states. From characterizing the phenomenon to be studied to offering an explanation, the behaviorist is committed to avoiding all terms that denote entities, quantities or interactions that are internal or unobservable.
A corollary of the thesis, which is frequently highlighted as an independent claim, is that introspection is not a scientific form of observation. One might argue (as historical figures like William James and William Wundt did–see “Error! Reference source not found.“ and “Error! Reference source not found.” p. Error! Bookmark not defined.) that internal states are scientifically observable via introspection.  Behaviorists, however, reject introspection as scientifically unreliable. Evidence from Wundt and James demonstrates, they argue, that introspective procedures produce different results for different practitioners, and scientific evidence should be replicable regardless of the practitioner.
Behaviorists disagree on whether internal mental states are non-existent fictions or merely unavailable to scientific inquiry; but that is not important here. What is important is that these putative internal mental states do not enter into the scientific study of behavior, or the scientific language that describes and explains behavior.
2.	The proper object of study for psychology is the organism and its environment. As a corollary of this insight, Behaviorists see behavior as the activity of an organism, not the activity of a mind. Psychology, for the behaviorist, is not the study of parts of an organism (such as the “ego,” “id,” and “superego”) and their relations, but rather the organism as a whole and its relationships with its environments.  And similarly, explanations offered by Behaviorists refer to organisms, behaviors and environmental conditions, not methods of repression and techniques of representation. Behaviorism restricts is object of study as well as its explanations to the macroscopic scale: things that can be directly observed by the naked eye. In the classical sense, Behaviorism rejects as non-scientific explanations in terms of or investigations into things that are larger (societies, cultures) or smaller (brains, neurons).
This thesis unites behaviorism with classical psychoanalysis in opposition to Jung, because it holds that all present behavior is the result of discrete learning events in the individual's past.   But unlike psychoanalytic explanations that posit unresolved psychic conflict to explain behavior, the behaviorist appeals only to previous learning experiences. To discover the reason for a given behavior then, is to discover the patterns of environmental reinforcement (called 'conditioning') that have caused the organism to learn this behavior. To cure a behavior is to 'extinguish' those conditioned responses in the organism or block those responses by substituting a new and novel response. Behaviorists hypothesize that learning can be physically realized in neurology, and hence, behaviorism is far more simple and plausible a theory than psychoanalysis, which cannot.
3.	The principles of learning are generalizable across species. Behaviorists argue that given that animals are incapable of introspection—or, if they are, they cannot communicate it—psychological theories that make use of introspection are incapable of explaining animal psychology.  Behaviorism, however, is not. Non-human animals are organisms living in environments that behave in certain regular ways. All of that is accessible to behavioristic science. And as it is an uncontroversial observation that at least some human behavior is the same as animal behavior (caring for the young, for example), it follows that behaviorism can explain regularities that introspective psychology cannot.
Learning
A behavioristic explanation of a given behavior takes the form of specifying the mechanism of learning that caused this behavior.  A behavioristic treatment seeks to 'extinguish' that behavior through providing an antithetical mechanism.
Learning mechanisms in behaviorism are built on the principles of reinforcement and extinction. Explanation of reinforcement and extinction are always specified in terms of stimulus and response. According to Watson, by 'stimulus' behaviorists “mean any object in the general environment or any change in the physiological condition of the animal, such as the change we get when we keep an animal from sex activity, when we keep it from feeding, when we keep it from building a nest.”  By 'response' behaviorists “mean that system of organized activity that we see emphasized anywhere in any kind of animal, as building a skyscraper, drawing plans, having babies, writing books, and the like.” (1929)
In recent years, B.F. Skinner has popularize operant conditioning and the idea of 'reinforcing' a behavior. Anything that increases the likelihood of a response given a stimulus is a reinforcement.  Positive reinforcement takes the form of adding some “rewarding” object to the environment when the desired response occurs.  “Negative” reinforcement usually means the removal of such objects.  Reinforcing objects need not be physical, tangible objects, but can something as intangible as the attention of a parent. “Punishment” is a negative condition applied to the organism following a behavior.
A decrease in the probability of a response given a stimulus over time is called extinction. In classical conditioning models of learning, the lack of repetitive exposure to reinforcement will result in progressive extinction of the conditioned response.
The mechanisms learning are:
•	Classical conditioning, which is sometimes called 'past reinforcement,' occurs when an unconditioned stimulus, such as the presentation of food, causes an unconditioned ('natural') response, such as salivation. These 'natural' stimulus-response patterns are called “embryologic responses,” and they are raw material of a classical conditioning paradigm. In classical conditioning, the conditioning intervention in the embryological response occurs by pairing a 'conditioned stimulus' (such as the ringing of a bell) with the unconditioned stimulus. After repeated exposures, the original unconditioned response can be removed, and the response (now 'conditioned') will occur when the subject is presented with the conditioned stimulus. These basic pairings between conditioned stimuli and responses can be generalized over time, so that any loud noise, for example, may cause salivation.  
•	Operant conditioning differs from classical conditioning insofar as the conditioning intervention occurs after the response, rather than concurrent with the unconditioned stimulus. Operant condition introduces the possibility of promised reinforcement, which would occur when the promise of future reinforcement causes behavior.
Behaviorism as a treatment in psychiatry
Behavioral treatments in psychiatry, like behaviorism in psychology, follows from a deceptively simple insight: that psychiatric treatment aims at the cessation of maladaptive behavior.  Like psychoanalysis, behavioral therapies restrict themselves to neurosis, not psychosis.
There are two major kinds of inhibition therapies found in the literature:
•	Reciprocal inhibition, developed by Wolpe, involves diminishing the maladaptive behavior by conditioning a new behavior in response to a given stimulus that is incompatible with the undesired behavior. For reciprocal inhibition to work, the maladaptive behavior must be incompatible with the new conditioned behavior. Aversion therapy, which exposes the subject to the object of desire and conditions a new negative response, is a form of reciprocal inhibition.
•	Transmarginal inhibition, also known as flooding, involves exposing the patient to strong examples of the stimuli for prolonged periods.
Other inhibition therapies, such as 'retroactive inhibition' are usually forms of reciprocal inhibition.

Cognitivists
Cognitivists reject the behaviorists' conjecture that scientific psychology is limited—as scientific psychology—to observable behavior. But neither do they seek to reestablish introspection as a valid observational method.  Cognitivists agree that scientific evidence must be observable. But they disagree that the explanations of behavior must necessarily be in terms of observable macro-objects like organisms and environments.  Cognitivists see the mind/brain as an information-processing system; therefore an adequate scientific explanations would take form of the specifying the mechanisms by which information is processed—including positing algorithms or modeling neural mechanisms that would generate the behavior in question. The difference between the Cognitivists and the Behaviorists is not about the experimental methods they follow, but rather about the structure of a scientific explanation.
Thus, cognitivism distinguishes itself from behaviorism in terms of a meta-theoretical thesis which rejects the half of the first behavioristic hypothesis:that internal entities are explanatorily irrelevant to psychology. It does not reject the other three, or the corollary of the first, that introspection is not a form of observation.
Cognitivism grew slowly between 1955 and 1965, in part because it was not an 'intentional' revolution like Behaviorism. George Miller's 1956 paper “The magical number seven, plus or minus two: Some limits on our capacity for processing information,” is one of the classics of cognitive psychology, although the term 'cognitive psychology' does not appear in it (see Error! Reference source not found. on p. Error! Bookmark not defined.). Miller argues that  human's short-term memory behavior is limited to seven items plus or minus two.  These 'items', however, need not be individual atomic units like Ebbinghaus' nonsense syllables.  Miller hypothesized that brain could 'chunking' information into groups, which then could be easily remembered. To borrow a classic example from Bechtel and Graham, the sequence A, B, C, B, B, C, N, B, C, C, B, S would be difficult to remember on its own, but if it is 'chunked' into ABC, BBC, NBC, CBS, remembering it is simple. According to Miller, “There seems to be some limitation built into us either by learning or by design of our nervous system, al limit that keeps our channel capacities in this general range.” (1956, p. 86)  See Error!

Psychoanalysts
Richard Green, MD Professor of Psychology, UCLA (Psychoanalyst)*
Professor of Psychology and UCLA, Green is most well known for his groundbreaking studies of 'sissy boys' and 'tomboy' girls, conducted with John Money of Johns Hopkins University. Green's recent essay “Mythological, Historical and Cross-Cultural Aspects of Transsexualism”, which is reprinted in the book he co-edited with his mentor John Money Transsexualism and Sex Reassignment (1969), traces the “longstanding and widespread pervasiveness of the transsexual phenomenon.”

Judd Marmor, MD Psychiatrist, Hollywood, CA (Psychoanalyst - Freudian)
The 'Psychiatrist to the stars', Judd Marmor has built an impressive psychiatric practice in L.A., after having immigrated to the US from Britain after serving in the British Navy during WWII. Rumor has it that many of the popular portrayals of psychoanalysis in the movies today are based on you.
Initial Member of the Research committee, term expiring 1974.
Notable Work:

Charles W. Socarides, MD Professor of Psychiatry, Columbia University and/or Irving Bieber, MD Professor of Psychiatry, NYU Medical College (Psychoanalysts - Freudian)
Irving Bieber is Professor of Psychiatry at New York University Medical College and Charles Socarides at Columbia University.  Socarides and Bieber have spent most of their career treating and studying male homosexuality. Bieber is primary author of the 1962 study Homosexuality: A Psychoanalytic Study of Male Homosexuals is, in many ways, a response to the Kinsey Report. It reports on you study of 106 male homosexuals and 100 male heterosexuals seeking psychoanalysis for various problems.  According to Socarides and Bieber,  homosexuality is a neurotic adaptation to unresolved conflict, usually originating in the Oedipal stage of development.

John P. Spiegel, MD  Director, Lemberg Center for the Study of Violence, Brandeis University (Psychoanalyst)
World-famous for his study of combat fatigue, co-authored with Dr. Roy Grinker in the 1945 book Men Under Stress.  Grinker and Spiegel argued, quite persuasively, that combat fatigue was not a result of a character flaw, but rather the social circumstances of war. It should, therefore, be treated, not punished. Spiegel is a former president of the American Academy of Psychoanalysis.
Initial member of the nomenclature committee, term expiring 1974.

Behaviorists
Albert Bandura, PhD  Professor of Psychology, Stanford (Behaviorist)
Initially serving the APA as Vice president (or President-elect) of the APA in 1971, will become president in 1972. He is therefore an initial member of the board of directors.
Bandura was trained in Behaviorism while at the University of Iowa, where Hull's advocate Spense taught. He was not, however, attracted to the strict mathematical-deductive model proposed by Hull, tending towards the work of Tolman.  After graduating Iowa, he went west to work with other like-minded Tolman followers. Currently, Bandura is a Professor of Psychology at Stanford University. His work on 'social learning,' which was started by his 'bobo-doll' studies, is widely known. Many expect his presidential address in 1972 to both explain his notion of 'vicarious reinforcement,' and articulate the relationship between his behavioristic approach and Miller's new 'cognitive psychology'.
Bandura was elected as a Fellow of the APA in 1964.
Notable works
 Bandura, A. (1965). Vicarious processes: A case of no-trial learning. In L. Berkowitz (Ed.), Advances in experimental social psychology (Vol. 2, pp. 1-55). New York: Academic Press.
Harry Harlow, PhD Professor of Psychology, University of Wisconsin (Behaviorist)
Initially 'former' president, serving on the board of directors.
Harlow is most well known for his series of experiments on separation anxiety in baby rhesus monkeys, Harry Harlow has become one of the most important advocates for behaviorism in the APA today.  Harlow's primate lab at the University of Wisconsin is widely recognized as one of the top places for training young researchers in experimental psychology.  Harlow won the Society for Experimental Psychology's Howard Crosby Warren medal in 1956 and the National Medal of Science in 1967.  He served as President of the APA in 1970.  
Notable works

Evelyn Hooker, PhD  Emeritus Professor of Psychology, UCLA (Behaviorist)
Evelyn Hooker studied with Karl Meunzinger and Robert Yerkes, pioneers in the fields of animal behavior. Starting in the 1950s, Hooker became interested in human sexuality. In 1953, she won a grant from the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) to study the mental health of 'non-patient, non-inmate homosexuals'.  Hooker showed that if homosexuality itself were removed from the diagnostic information, homosexual men were no more likely to be diagnosed as 'neurotic' than heterosexual men.
On the program for the first class with Dr. H. Anonymous as a panelist on the topic 'Psychiatry: Friend or Foe to Homosexuals: A Dialogue'
Initial member of the Program committee, term expiring 1972.
Notable works
Hooker, E. (1956). A preliminary analysis of group behavior of homosexuals. Journal of Psychology, 42, 217-225.
Cognitivists
Noam Chomsky, PhD Professor of Linguistics, MIT (Cognitivist, Linguist, Political Radical)
In 1971, Noam Chomsky is a quickly rising star in the academy. Currently a professor of Linguistics at MIT, his work is revolutionizing the field, changing the very idea of linguistics from the descriptive study of existing languages to the understanding of how languages result from formal (logical) rules. Chomsky is also a harsh critic of Skinner's radical behaviorism. His review of Skinner's 'Verbal Behavior' is widely seen as a devastating blow to behaviorism. It is contained in the appendix.
See, e.g.:
Chomsky, N. (1959). "Review of Skinner's Verbal Behaviour" Language 35: 26-58. Electronic copy of ‘review’ with preface: http://cogprints.org/1148/0/chomsky.htm (included in the appendix)
Chomsky, N. (1966). Cartesian Linguistics New York, 1966
George Miller, PhD Professor of Psychology, Harvard (Cognitivist)
President of the APA in 1971. When the game begins, Miller is serving on the board of directors and responsible for the Presidential address to open the first game session. Miller was trained in behaviorism, but, in part because of his friendship with Chomsky, has developed a new approach he calls 'Cognitive Psychology.' Miller has a side interest in the history of psychology, having worked with E.G. Boring and authored Psychology: the science of mental life.

A young neuroscientist from Cambridge, England, not yet finished with his PhD Working on a information-theoretical model of how the brain's visual system works.
Independents
George W. Albee, PhD Professor of Psychology, University of Vermont (Independent  - clinical psychologist)
Clinical Psychologist.  Albee worked as the executive secretary for the APA from 1951-1953, along side Harry Harlow's wife. Many of the committee structures and procedures followed today were actually refined by Albee during his time as secretary.In the 1950s, he chaired a task force to survey the resources available to mental heath professionals. The astonishing clarity of the resulting report, along with Albee's unwavering commitment to preventative mental health practices caused a great stir in psychiatric and psychological circles.
Author of 'A declaration of independence for psychology' (1964), Albee is a major figure in the often 'acrimonious' debate regarding the suitability of the medical model for understanding mental illness. If any questions arise regarding the APA's decision-making procedures, Albee is the person to ask.  He has held every position of responsibility in the organization save the Presidency and Vice-Presidency.
Initial member of the nomenclature committee, term expiring 1972. In classes over 16, also 'member at large' for the board of directors starting in 1971.

Kenneth Clark, along with his wife  Mamie Phipps Clark, are the authors of a hugely famous study of the racial attitudes of young children. Ken and Mamie presented four identical plastic dolls that different only with respect to color to black children between the ages of three and seven. When asked which doll they preferred, the majority selected the white doll. When asked to color in a drawing 'the same color' as themselves, most of the black children choose yellow or white crayons. Ken Clark testified as an expert in three of the five cases that were combined into the landmark school desegregation decision Brown v. The Board of Education, and his summary was cited by Chief Justice Warren (footnote 11) as influencing the court's decision.

</Text>
            <Comments>'Neurotic' behavior results from continuing conflict between the libinal desires and the ego's repression techniques. 'Psychotic' behaviors result when the libinal desires assert their reality on the ego. See the discussion of 'neurosis' and 'psychosis' in the History of the Classification of Mental Illness section below.
The Introductory Lectures were published before Freud solidified the structural hypothesis using this terminology.  The beginnings of the idea, however, is present in the later chapters on neurosis: see, e.g. p. 437-438, where he describes the conflict between the 'libido' and the 'ego'.
The Introductory Lectures mention only repression, subdivided into 'condensation' and 'displacement' as mechanisms of the ego, but promises further work on the topic (p. 364-366). He began to develop a taxonomy of ego mechanisms later in his life, but the full-fledged taxonomy we see here was developed his daughter Anna Freud (1936). The Ego and and the Mechanisms of Defense. C. Baines (trans). Connecticut: International University Press.
In many works, including Psychopathology in Everyday Life, Introductory Lectures on Psychoanalysis and On the Interpretation of Dream, Freud provides the following outline of the kinds of commonality that underly symbolism: that of number (i.e. '3' and male genitalia), shape (i.e. long, straight objects such as sticks, umbrellas, posts, trees represent the male organ / hollowness or enclosing space such as vessels, bottles, boxes, trunks and ships symbolize female genitals; apples, peaches and fruit symbolize breasts), function (i.e. penetrating the body: knives, daggers, spears, sabers, firearms, rifles, pistols etc.; producing liquids, such as water-taps, water-cans, etc.; and being capable of lengthening or shortening, such as pencils, hanging-lamps, etc.; defying gravity (i.e. balloons, flying machines and zeppelins also represent the male organ). More complicated representations depend on personal associations with or reactions to objects: the complicated nature of landscapes mean they represent female bodies, sweets represent sexual satisfaction. Activities such as playing games, playing piano, sliding, gliding or pulling stand for masturbation because of the similarity of action. On the same note, rhythmic actions such as dancing, riding and climbing stand in for the sex act itself. Simple associations may appear as well: neckties, which are only worn by men, can symbolize men. (Introductory Lectures, p. 188-204)
see 290-294 of the DSM II, which is included in Appendix 6.
see 295-299 of the DSM II
See item 300 in the DSM II for the full taxonomy of neurosis.
There is something of a controversy over whether psychoanalysis can be used to treat psychosis. While many psychoanalysts believe psychosis and neurosis to be on a single spectrum of mental dysfunction, the psychotic patient's connection to reality is so tenuous that the techniques of free-association and transference threaten to develop the psychosis further, rather than dissolve it.
In Aristotlean metaphysics, the formal cause of something is the form of the thing whereas the immediate cause are the events that immediately proceeded the thing in question.  The form is the pattern or type of thing something is. The immediate cause is what brings that thing into being. In this context, the form distinguishes the type of neurosis, the immediate cause is what caused the neurosis to present at this moment.
As with most things in the history of ideas, even this definition is controversial.  I've chosen this definition, which reflects Skinner's presentation of Behaviorism in his 1953 Science and Human Behavior, chapter 1 because it is the most explicit and radical.  Watson defines that the goal of behaviorism as the “prediction and control of behavior,” (1913) leaving out observation. To understand the various different forms of behaviorism that have been posited since Watson's, please see Error! Reference source not found. on p. Error! Bookmark not defined.Psychoanalysts
See, for further explication of this claim, Skinner 1953, p. 27-31. Watson does not use the term 'inner state', but refers rather to 'consciousness', which he (possibly fallaciously) equates with the object of introspection. Thus, after objecting to the unreliability of introspective reports in a laboratory setting he claims “The time seems to have come when psychology must discard all references to consciousness; when it need no longer delude itself into thinking that it is making mental states the object of observation.”
Animals do not have superegos or techniques of repression, so the behaviors explained in psychoanalytic terms should not generalize across species. But they do. Therefore, psychoanalytic explanations are insufficient.
Watson seeks to eliminate the following misleading and unscientific terms from psychology: “consciousness, mental states, mind, content, introspectively verifiable, imagery, and the like.” (1913)
See, e.g. Watson 1913 “Introspection forms no essential part of its methods, nor is the scientific value of its data dependent upon the readiness with which they lend themselves to interpretation in terms of consciousness” and Skinner 1953 p. 30
Recall that Behaviorism was formed in the first half of the 20th century, when Hegelianism was a viable theory of social science. Behaviorists here are not rejecting the plausibility of modern social psychology, anthropology or sociology. They are rejecting the idea of a transcendent spirit that instantiates human culture.
See, e.g. Watson 1913 “The behaviorist, in his efforts to get a unitary scheme of animal response, recognizes no dividing line between man and brute.”
For more on the complicated history of the relationship between psychoanalysis and behaviorism, see Hornstein 2002.

            <Text>Ethics of human research

Ethical codes of research have generally followed the discovery or publication of horrifically unethical experiments.  The most famous of these is probably the Nuremberg Code, adopted by the international medical community after the discovery of the Nazi 'experiments' performed on Jews, Homosexuals and Gypsies during the Holocaust.  The Nuremberg code is available online, and should be reviewed by anyone proposing an experiment or sitting on the Research Committee. See http://www.ushmm.org/research/doctors/Nuremberg_Code.htm.

The Nuremberg Code
The Nuremberg code lays out ten simple principles for design experiments on humans. They are:
1.	The voluntary consent of the human subject is absolutely essential. This means that the person involved should have legal capacity to give consent; should be so situated as to be able to exercise free power of choice, without the intervention of any element of force, fraud, deceit, duress, overreaching, or other ulterior form of constraint or coercion; and should have sufficient knowledge and comprehension of the elements of the subject matter involved as to enable him to make an understanding and enlightened decision. This latter element requires that before the acceptance of an affirmative decision by the experimental subject there should be made known to him the nature, duration, and purpose of the experiment; the method and means by which it is to be conducted; all inconveniences and hazards reasonably to be expected; and the effects upon his health or person which may possibly come from his participation in the experiment.

The duty and responsibility for ascertaining the quality of the consent rests upon each individual who initiates, directs, or engages in the experiment. It is a personal duty and responsibility which may not be delegated to another with impunity.
2.	The experiment should be such as to yield fruitful results for the good of society, unprocurable by other methods of means of study, and not random and unnecessary in nature.
3.	The experiment should be so designed and based on the results of animal experimentation and a knowledge of the natural history of the disease or other problem under study that the anticipated results will justify the performance of the experiment.
4.	The experiment should be so conducted as to avoid all unnecessary physical and mental suffering and injury.
5.	No experiment should be conducted where there is an a priori reason to believe that death or disabling injury will occur; except, perhaps, in those experiments where the experimental physicians also serve as subjects.
6.	The degree of risk to be taken should never exceed that determined by the humanitarian importance of the problem to be solved by the experiment.
7.	Proper preparations should be made and adequate facilities provided to protect the experimental subject against even remote possibilities of injury, disability or death.
8.	The experiment should be conducted only by scientifically qualified persons. The highest degree of skill and care should be required though all stages of the experiment of those who conduct or engage in the experiment.
9.	During the course of the experiment the human subject should be at liberty to bring the experiment to an end if he has reached the physical or mental state where continuation of the experiment seems to him to be impossible.
10.	During the course of the experiment the scientist in charge must be prepared to terminate the experiment at any stage, if he has probable cause to believe, in the exercise of the good faith, superior skill and careful judgment required of him that a continuation of the experiment is likely to result in injury, disability or death to the experimental subject.
Table 1: The Nuremberg Code
The Declaration of Helsinki
In 1964, the medical community through the World Medical Association adopted the 'Declaration of Helsinki', which replaced the Nuremberg code as the standard for ethical experimentation on humans by the medical community. The World Medical Association still maintains the Declaration, adopting the most recent revisions in 2004. It is available online (http://www.wma.net/e/policy/b3.htm).
Psychiatrists, as practicing medical doctors, are bound by the Declaration of Helsinki. While it is far more complete than the Nuremberg code, the same basic ideas appear:

I. Basic Principles
   1. Biomedical research involving human subjects must conform to generally accepted scientific principles and should be based on adequately performed laboratory and animal experimentation and on a thorough knowledge of the scientific literature.
   2. The design and performance of each experimental procedure involving human subjects should be clearly formulated in an experimental protocol which should be transmitted to a specially appointed independent committee for consideration, comment and guidance.
   3. Biomedical research involving human subjects should be conducted only by scientifically qualified persons and under the supervision of a clinically competent medical person. The responsibility for the human subject must always rest with a medically qualified person and never rest on the subject of the research, even though the subject has given his or her consent.
   4. Biomedical research involving human subjects cannot legitimately be carried out unless the importance of the objective is in proportion to the inherent risk to the subject.
   5. Every biomedical research project involving human subjects should be preceded by careful assessment of predictable risks in comparison with foreseeable benefits to the subject or to others. Concern for the interests of the subject must always prevail over the interests of science and society.
   6. The right of the research subject to safeguard his or her integrity must always be respected. Every precaution should be taken to respect the privacy of the subject and to minimize the impact of the study on the subject's physical and mental integrity and on the personality of the subject.
   7. Physicians should abstain from engaging in research projects involving human subjects unless they are satisfied that the hazards involved are believed to be predictable. Physicians should cease any investigation if the hazards are found to outweigh the potential benefits.
   8. In publication of the results of his or her research, the physician is obliged to preserve the accuracy of the results. Reports of experimentation not in accordance with the principles laid down in this Declaration should not be accepted for publication.
   9. In any research on human beings, each potential subject mustbe adequately informed of the aims, methods, anticipated benefits and potential hazards of the study and the discomfort it may entail. He or she should be informed that he or she is at liberty to abstain from participation in the study and that he or she is free to withdraw visor her consent to participation at any time. The physician should then obtain the subject's freely given informed consent, preferably inheriting.
  10. When obtaining informed consent for the research project the physician should be particularly cautious if the subject is in dependent relationship to him or her or may consent under duress. In that case the informed consent should be obtained by a physician who isn't engaged in the investigation and who is completely independent of this official relationship.
  11. In case of legal incompetence, informed consent should be obtained from the legal guardian in accordance with national legislation. Where physical or mental incapacity makes it impossible to obtain informed consent, or when the subject is a minor, permission from the responsible relative replaces that of the subject in accordance with national legislation. Whenever the minor child is in fact able to give a consent, the minor's consent must be obtained in addition to the consent of the minor's legal guardian.
  12. The research protocol should always contain a statement of the ethical considerations involved and should indicate that the principles enunciated in the present declaration are complied with.
II. Medical Research Combined with Professional Care (Clinical Research)
   1. In the treatment of the sick person, the physician must be free to use a new diagnostic and therapeutic measure, if in his or her judgement it offers hope of saving life, re-establishing health or alleviating suffering.
   2. The potential benefits, hazards and discomfort of a new method should be weighed against the advantages of the best current diagnostic and therapeutic methods.
   3. In any medical study, every patient- including those of a control group, if any- should be assured of the best proven diagnostic and therapeutic method.
   4. The refusal of the patient to participate in a study must never interfere with the physician-patient relationship.
   5. If the physician considers it essential not to obtain informed consent, the specific reasons for this proposal should be stated in the experimental protocol for transmission to the independent committee (1, 2).
   6. The physician can combine medical research with professional care, the objective being the acquisition of new medical knowledge,only to the extent that medical research is justified by its potential diagnostic or therapeutic value for the patient.
III. Non-Therapeutic Biomedical Research Involving Human Subjects (Non-Clinical Biomedical Research)
   1. In the purely scientific application of medical research carried out on a human being, it is the duty of the physician to remain the protector of the life and health of that person on whom biomedical research is being carried out.
   2. The subjects should be volunteers- either healthy persons or patients for whom the experimental design is not related to the patient's illness.
   3. The investigator or the investigating team should discontinue the research if in his/her or their judgment it may, if continued, be harmful to the individual.
4.	In research on man, the interest of science and society should never take precedence over considerations related to the well-being of the subject.
Table 2: Declaration of Helsinki

In the context of psychiatry, of course, the distinction made between therapeutic research and non-therapeutic research is crucially important.  If a psychiatric patient were to be deemed incapable of making an informed decision, and there is an experiment therapy that the psychiatrist believes may help, there are few ethical checks and balances to constrain the psychiatrist from performing unwarranted experiments.
The APA Ethical Standards for Psychologists
The APA Standards were first published in 1953. They were revised in 1959, 1963 and 1968. The 1968 standards, which should guide the research committee in determining which research programs should be allowed to move forward, are attached in the Appendix.
Most of the APA standards outline the responsibilities of psychologists who practice counseling and patient care.  While those are incredibly important, we're most concerned here with Principle 16: Research Precautions.  In 1959, section 16 was titled 'Harmful Aftereffect.' It read:
Principle 16. Harmful Aftereffects. Only when a problem is significant and can be investigated in no other way is the psychologist justified in giving misinformation to research subjects or exposing research subjects to physical or emotional stress.
a. When the possibility of serious aftereffects exists, research is conducted only when the subjects or the responsible agents are fully informed of this possibility and volunteer nevertheless.
b. The psychologist seriously considers the possibility harmful aftereffects and removes them as soon as permitted by the design of the experiment.
1.	c. A psychologist using animals in research adheres to the provisions of the Rules Regarding Animals, drawn up by the Committee on Precautions in Animal Experimentation and adopted by the American Psychological Association.
Table 3: APA Ethical Standards: 1959
Four years later, in 1963, the committee responsible for the Ethical guidelines move the 'preamble' into a numbered point (a), changed the title to 'Research Precautions' and added a new preamble. It also changed the phrase 'is significant' to 'is of scientific significance'; ' can be investigated in no other way' became ' it is not practicable to investigate it in any other way'; ' giving misinformation to research subjects' was dropped; and the phrase 'whether children or adults' added to the new point (a). (b) added the qualification of  'reasonable' to 'possibility'; changed 'harmful' to 'injurious' and 'volunteer' became 'agree to participate'.  © changed 'removes' to 'avoids or removes'; and (d) were unchanged: (changes italicized)

Principle 16. Research Precautions. The psychologist assumes obligations for the welfare of his research subjects, both animal and human.
a. Only when a problem is of scientific significance and it is not practicable to investigate it in any other way is the psychologist justified in exposing research subjects research subjects, whether children or adults, to physical or emotional stress.
b. When the possibility of injurious aftereffects exists, research is conducted only when the subjects or the responsible agents are fully informed of this possibility and agree to participate nevertheless.
c. The psychologist seriously considers the possibility harmful aftereffects and avoids or removes them as soon as permitted by the design of the experiment.
2.	d. A psychologist using animals in research adheres to the provisions of the Rules Regarding Animals, drawn up by the Committee on Precautions in Animal Experimentation and adopted by the American Psychological Association.
Table 4: APA Ethical Standards 1963

 These changed little between 1963 and 1968, except for the addition of  the qualifying phrase 'as part of the investigation' to (a) and adding provision (e) governing the use of psychoactive drugs:

Principle 16. Research Precautions. The psychologist assumes obligations for the welfare of his research subjects, both animal and human.
a. Only when a problem is of scientific significance and it is not practicable to investigate it in any other way is the psychologist justified in exposing research subjects research subjects, whether children or adults, to physical or emotional stress as part of an investigation.
b. When the possibility of injurious aftereffects exists, research is conducted only when the subjects or the responsible agents are fully informed of this possibility and agree to participate nevertheless.
c. The psychologist seriously considers the possibility harmful aftereffects and avoids, or removes them as soon as permitted by the design of the experiment.
3.	d. A psychologist using animals in research adheres to the provisions of the Rules Regarding Animals, drawn up by the Committee on Precautions in Animal Experimentation and adopted by the American Psychological Association.
e. Investigations of human subjects using experimental drugs (for example, hallucinogenic, psychotomimetic, psychedelic, or similar substances) should be conducted only in such settings as clinics, hospitals, or research facilities maintaining appropriate safeguards for the subjects.

Brief history of definitions of 'Psychology'
Pre-history of Psychology:
The scientific investigation into the human mind and/or human behavior begins almost simultaneously with science itself.  We must then begin with the followers of Francis Bacon, and trace the idea that the mind is open to empirical inquiry through the empiricists into the present day.
Bacon, who we now credit with establishing 'The Scientific Method,' argued that the human mind tended to distort reality in regular, systematic ways, which he called 'idols.' In order to understand reality, we must then give up on the idea that a single person can discover the truth on his or her own. In order to learn about the world, we need to work together, collaboratively creating a “natural and experimental history” (Bk 2, Ch X, p 109) of the phenomenon.  As working collaboratively can lead to confusion and misunderstanding, we organize that natural and experimental history into a series of tables: including instances of the phenomenon's presence, closely related instances in which the phenomenon is absent, instances in which the phenomenon occurs in degrees or in comparison, and instances of exclusion of the phenomenon. Once these tables are built, we review them and create what Bacon called a 'first harvest' of the phenomenon. In short, this is a generalized axiom unifying the phenomenon yet held close to observation. Once that first axiom is established, we return to the tables, highlighting privileged instances which are further classified as solitary, transitory, revealing, etc. These, then can be used to further refine the first harvest into further, more careful axioms.
Bacon profoundly influenced Elizabethan England. His empirical method sparked inquiry in almost all areas of human knowledge, and formed the basis for what we now call the 'scientific revolution' or the 'enlightenment.' His influence on psychology and psychiatry is actually far more direct than most assume.  Late in his life, Bacon became good friends with the Philosopher Thomas Hobbes. In fact, Hobbes founded a Baconian reading group in Oxford, which is the forebearer of the Royal Society—the world's oldest scientific body.
Thomas Hobbes, who is most widely known for his initiation of social-contract theory in defense of absolute monarchy, opens his master work Leviathan with this bold claim:
Nature (the art whereby God hath made and governs the world) is by the art of man, as in many other things, so in this also imitated, that it can make an artificial animal.  For seeing life is but a motion of limbs, the beginning whereof is in some principal part within, why may we not say that all automata (engines that move themselves by springs and wheels as doth a watch) have an artificial life? For what is the heart, but a spring; and the nerves, but so many strings; and the joints, but so many wheels, giving motion to the whole body such was was intended by the artificer? (Ch 1, S1)
Just as his famous social-political philosophy posited universal laws of human conduct, Hobbes believed that the human mind followed to universal laws which were deducible through reason. To discover these laws, one must look at what separates humans (who have minds) from animals (who are supposed to not).  According to Hobbes, humans surpass animals insofar as they are “apt to inquire the consequences of it, and what effects he could do with it.”  In addition, humans can “can by words reduce the consequences he finds to general rules, called theorems, or aphorisms; that is, he can reason, or reckon, not only in number, but in all other things whereof one may be added unto or subtracted from another.” (Ch V, S6).  
Thus we have the beginning of psychology: human minds work by the process of deducing consequences and abstracting from particular experiences to general rules through basic logical functions. You may recall from the previous section that Hobbes was, in part, responding to Descartes' argument that the mind must be separate and distinct from the human body.
Descartes' most famous argument for mind-body dualism asks us to doubt all that cannot be known with certainty, and then concludes that one cannot doubt that one is doubting; hence thinking; hence one cannot doubt that one is a thinking thing.  This famous argument (called the “cogito” is contained the First Meditation. But Descartes offers a much more interesting and influential argument in a number of other writings. The argument appears twice in The Discourse on Methods, first in part 3:
...if there were such machines having the organs and the shape of a monkey or of some other animal that lacked reason, we would have no way of recognizing that they were not entirely of the same nature as these animals; where as, if there were any such machines that bore a resemblance to our bodies and imitated our actions as far as this is practically feasible, we would always have two very certain means of recognizing that they were not at all, for that reason, true men.  The first is that they could never use words or other signs, or put them together as we do in order to declare our thoughts to others.  For one can well conceive of a machine being so made that it utters words, and even that it utters words appropriate to the bodily actions that will cause some change in its organs... But it could not arrange its words differently so as to respond to the sense of all that will be said in its presence, as even the dullest men can do. (Discourse, Ch 3, 1637)
And then again in part 5:
[in looking at the body] I found there precisely all those things that can be in us without our thinking about them, and hence, without our soul's contributing to them, that is to say, that part distinct from the body of which it has been said previously that its nature is only to think.  And these are all the same features in which one can say that animals lacking reason resemble us.  But I could not on that account find there any of those functions, which, being dependent on thought, are the only ones that belong to us as men, although I did find them all later on, once I had supposed God created a rational soul and joined it to this body in particular manner that I described. (Discourse, Ch 5, 1637)
The same point appears in his Letter to Henry More:
Nevertheless it has never been observed that any brute beast arrived at such perfection that it could use true speech, that is, that it indicated by words or signs something that can be ascribed to thought alone, and not to a natural impulse.  For speech is the only certain sign of thought concealed in the body, and all men, even the stupidest and most insane, make use of it, but not any brute.  Therefore, this can be taken to be the true differentia between man and brutes (Reply to Henry More, S5)
In these passages, Descartes ascribes to humans alone the ability to use language and conceive of abstract ideas. He then finds that these abilities cannot be the products of material, finite reality. As experience is limited to finite reality, ideas of things that are not finite must be 'ascribed to thought alone.' Thus, these ideas must be innate to the mind and not based on experience. It  follows that that these distinctly human abilities are the products of a non-material infinite reality. In short, the argument is this:
1.	Humans alone use language and conceive of abstract entities (i.e. 'infinity').
2.	No material mechanism could ever use language or conceive of an abstract entity.
3.	Therefore, humans cannot just be not material mechanism

Hobbes' assertion that human beings could be imitated through material mechanisms runs directly counter to Descartes' argument. But insofar it is only an assertion—a hypothesis—it needs empirical demonstration. To establish Hobbes' contention and meet Descartes' challenge scientifically, Hobbes must show a physical machine could, through experience, develop both the ability to speak rationally and conceive of abstract entities that are not clearly the product of experience (such as 'infinity').
It is easy to see how the process of 'addition and subtraction' could produce a concept of infinity. But it is hard to see how simple arithmetic could produce a machine that could “arrange its words differently so as to respond to the sense of all that will be said in its presence, as even the dullest men can do.”
Locke's famous Essay on Human Understanding opens with a fifty-eight page argument against the idea of innate ideas. Locke picks up the project where Hobbes left off, adding 'reflection' (what we now call 'introspection') as an additional source of ideas, but leaving the other main theses in place. For Locke, like for Hobbes , the mind is populated with ideas that originate in experience. We come to understand our minds, and how our minds occasionally lead us astray, by understanding the mental mechanisms that produce ideas from sensation. Abstract ideas like 'infinity' are the products of a process of abstraction:
Finite then, and infinite, being by the mind looked on as modifications of expansion and duration, the next thing to be considered, is, -How the mind comes by them.  As for the idea of the finite, there is no great difficulty...Every one that has an idea of any stated lengths of space, as a foot, finds that he can repeat that idea; and joining it to the former, make the idea of two feet; and by the addition of a third, three feet; and so on, without every coming to an end of his additions, whether of the same idea of a foot, or, if he pleases, of doubling it, or any idea he has of any length, as a mile, or diameter of the earth, or of the orbis magnus...This, I think, is the way whereby the mind gets the idea of infinite space. --Essay Book 2, Ch17
But like Hobbes, Locke fails to explain how language structure could be produced by a finite mechanism.
At the same time, Antione Arnaud, a fervent supporter of Descartes' theory of mind, was developing a school of thought in France which we now call the 'Port-Royalist' movement. The Port-Royalists held that the structure of grammar was universal for humans and could be reduced to the laws of logic. Unlike the empiricists Hobbes and Locke, however, the Port-Royalists, who including the great logician and mathematician Pascal, were dualists and theists. For the Port-Royalists, thought was different from language, although we tend to think in language through force of habit.  Pure thought, both in its content and its structure, becomes imperfect when 'translated' into an imperfect spoken language. A perfect language, and perfect grammar, would be possible if each word signified unequivocally a single simple idea, and the grammar of speech matched perfectly the 'grammar of thought.'
David Hume, the great Scottish Empiricist took the argument against innate ideas and married it to the idea of a universal structure of the mind. First, by extending the argument against innateness beyond the concept of the infinite:
The idea of God, as meaning an infinitely intelligent, wise, and good Being, arises from reflecting on the operations of our own mind, and augmenting, without limit, those qualities of goodness and wisdom. --Enquiry, S2 P14
And second, by advancing the thesis that principles of connection between ideas in the mind were regular and hence subject to empirical investigation. In fact, he posited three:  RESEMBLANCE, CONTIGUITY in time or place and CAUSE and EFFECT. (Treatise, Part 1, S IV). This thesis was supported by the universality of language structures:
It is evident that there is a principle of connexion between the different thoughts or ideas of the mind, and that, in the appearance to the memory or imagination, they introduce each other with a certain degree of method or regularity... ...Amoung different languages, even where we cannot suspect the least connexion or communication, it is found, that the words, expressive of ideas, the most compounded, do yet nearly correspond to each other: a certain proof that the simple ideas, comprehended in the compound ones, were bound together by some universal principle, which had an equal influence on all mankind.
Thus, with Hume, the empirical study of the mind begins in earnest, although 'psychology' was not distinguished from 'natural philosophy' for another century.
It is important to point out here that for these thinkers, the objects of study are ideas.  The central claim is that the relationships between ideas themselves, whether they be causal or grammatical, are regular and subject to law-like generalization. That central claim unites them with early psychology.  But as we will see, is the challenged in the Behaviorist revolution.
Birth – German Physiological Psychology in the 1880s-1890s.
In about 1847, four friends, three of them students of Johannes Müller (1801-1858), gathered together in Berlin to swear an oath dedicating themselves to undermining vitalism: the theory that all living entities shared a special irreducible ‘vital force.’  They committed themselves to the view that:
No other forces than the common physical-chemical ones are active within the organism. In those cases which cannot at the time be explained by these forces one has either to find the specific way or form of their action by means of the physical –mathematical method or assume new forces equal in dignity to the chemical-physical forces inherent in matter, reducible to the force of attraction and repulsion. (Ernst Jones, p. 40)

These four friends: Hermann von Helmholtz (1821-1894), Carl Ludwig (1816-1895), Emil du Bois-Reymond (1818-1896) and Ernst Wilhelm von Brücke (1819-1892), along with  Hermann Lotze (1817-1891) and his student Gustav Fechner (1801-1887), came to dominate the next generation of psychologist and psychiatrists: Helmholtz hired Christine Ladd-Franklin as his assistant, who went on to be one of the first woman member of the APA, and the first woman to hold a professorship at the University of Chicago. Freud studied under Brücke; Pavlov under Ludwig and Wundt under du Bois-Reymond. Wundt went on to work in Helmholtz’s lab after Ladd-Franklin returned to America.
While all four of these thinkers had a profound influence on the founding and development of psychology as a discipline, I'll focus my attention for the moment on Helmholtz.  Helmholtz was one of the great scientific minds of his era. Not only is he now recognized as a godfather of experimental psychology, he is widely respected in the history or Optics, and is, in many ways, the father of ophthalmology, having invented the ophthalmoscope.
His professor, Müller, held that nerves had 'specific sense energies' naturally: our sensory system had certain a priori assumptions about time and space literally built into them, making sensory experience like binocular vision possible. Students familiar with the history of philosophy may recognize this as a position influenced by Kantian psychology.
Helmholtz, however, posited that our mental system as a whole adjusted itself through a process of 'unconscious inference' to represent the external world. Thus, the contents of our experiences were merely 'signs' or 'indicators' of the objects in the world that our experiences represent.  The  sensory system automatically and unconsciously recovered the world through the complex information it has available. The unconscious inferences that produce stable representations of the world are not transparent to our experience, but neither are they innate.  They are, in short, trained through experience with the regularities of the world itself. Thus, the process of sensation was learned, not biologically determined. While contemporary psychophysics has advanced greatly since 1850, the basic model of how perception works in psychology today is Helmholtz's.
Fechner
On the morning of 22nd of October, 1850, a young physiologist named Gustav Theodor Fechner lay in bed, puzzled by the relationship between the intensity of a psychological experience (i.e. hearing a sound, measured by introspection) and the intensity of the physical stimulus (i.e. the amplitude of the air vibrations). On that morning, it occurred to him that the relative increase in the physical stimulus might correspond to the relative increase in the psychological experience.  It took him a decade to prepare the idea for publication, which he presented as 'Weber's law':

where dp is the change in the psychological experience, k is a constant to be determined experimentally, dS is the change in the stimulus and S is the stimulus. He added to this the idea that the physical stimulus must break a certain threshold to be perceivable at all to derive what is now known as 'Fechner's law':

Wehere S0 is the threshold under which the stimulus is not perceived.
Fechner's law is the first mathematical law (some might say 'model') in psychology.  It posits a specific relationship between a psychological entity (sensation) and a physical entity (the stimulus).  Unlike his predecessors who had contented themselves with discovering the relationships between ideas in a rather imprecise way, Fechner had both bridged the divide between the psychological and the physical, and given that bridge the precision of Calculus.  
Fechner's book, Elements of Psychophysics, published in 1860 had a profound effect in both German and England.  Physiologists now had a model of precision for which they could strive. And psychologists had a model of understanding the relationships between the physical and the psychological. Most importantly, however, the book inspired Hermann Ebbinghaus to begin studying memory.  But that story will have to be left to another time.
Wundt
Today, we generally consider Wilhem Wundt's lab at Leipzig to be the first true psychological laboratory.  Helmholtz's lab, it is argued, was a lab of physiology, not psychology.  Wundt, unlike Helmholtz, believed that the causal relations governing consciousness were of a different kind than those governing the 'external' world.  And it was the challenge of psychology to explain those regularities.
Wundt was, however, a student of the physiologist Helmholtz. Thus, a proper explanation of the laws of psychology would make use of the properties of the central nervous system. In Wundt's own words:
Physiology and psychology cover, between them, the field of vital phenomena; they deal with the facts of life at large, and in particular with the facts of human life. Physiology is concerned with all those phenomena of life that present themselves to us in sense perception as bodily processes, and accordingly form part of that total environment which we name the external world. Psychology, on the other hand, seeks to give account of the interconnection of processes which are evinced by our own consciousness, or which we infer from such manifestations of the bodily life in other creatures as indicate the presence of a consciousness similar to our own. (1902, p. 1)
Shortly thereafter, he asserts that Psychology is “the investigation of conscious process in the modes of connection peculiar to them.” (1902, p. 2) As consciousness is unique in the world, it can only, then, be approached with the investigative tools unique to consciousness: direct experience of consciousness by ourselves of inferred in others on the basis of direct observation and analogy.
This does not mean, however, that a science of psychology is purely introspective. On the contrary, Wundt proposed a 'physiological psychology': a theory of conscious experience informed by our physiological understanding of the brain, what Wundt calls the 'bodily substrate of mental life.'
The nervous system was thought to be made up of a 'central substance' that maintained an equilibrium and 'nerve-fibres' that connected cells together. This 'central stuff' was understood not to just transmit information, but to modify it in one of two ways: first, if it were exposed to repeated stimulus, the amount of energy needed to produce a response would decrease, and second, in some cases, it could invert the signal into it's opposite (i.e. from 'x more than equilibrium' to 'x less than equilibrium'). Wundt sought to reduce the four standard 'Laws of Association' of ideas—similarity, contrast, spatial and temporal contiguity— to simple 'internal connection', as 'contrast' is a completion of an idea in the same way 'similarity' is; and contiguity in space and time are external, not internal, relationships. Ideas tend to produce their contrasting idea, rather than ideas which are similar, when they are accompanied by strong feelings, as all feelings have a kind of 'elasticity' to them, always presenting with its opposite feeling implicitly.
'Internal connection,' is then is explained by what Wundt called 'central innervation,' or the properties of the nervous system.  It is a fundamental law of neuroscience, even then, that 'neurons that wire together fire together.'  For Wundt and his followers, the similarity and contrast of ideas was explainable by the excitation and inhibition properties of these nerves.
Pavlov
Ivan Pavlov was, like the others in this section, a physiologist first. His interest in psychology was, for the most part, tangential to his work in physiology. Between 1891 and 1900, Pavlov conducted a series of experiments on salivation in dogs. His primary interest at this time was to explain why dogs salivated when presented with food at a distance. The common-sense psychological explanation, of course, is that the dog wants the food. More technically, early psychologists would have said the dog associates food and saliva (even it it is unconscious). But those are not an acceptable physiological explanations, and they wouldn't satisfy Pavlov.
Using a recently invented apparatus, Pavlov was able to measure the amount of saliva dogs produced in response to a food stimulus. After a number of experiments, Pavlov noticed that the dogs were salivating without any food present. It occurred to him that in these case, the dogs' salivation response might be responding to the lab techs, rather than food itself. To test this hypothesis, he presented food to a dog and simultaneously rang a bell. After repeated exposures to this combination of stimuli, Pavlov removed the food, leaving just the bell. He found that the dogs still salivated.
Thus, Pavlov discovered what came to be called 'classical conditioning': to train a behavior, one presents a new stimulus (the conditioned stimulus) concurrently with the stimulus that 'naturally' produces the desired behavior (the unconditioned stimulus). After repeated training, the desired behavior (conditional response) will occur with the new (conditioned) stimulus, without the presence of the original, 'natural,' unconditioned stimulus.
Pavlov's primary application of his findings were to the nervous system as a whole as well as “heart, digestive tract and other organs in the higher animals” (lecture 23), he didn't shy away from suggesting that it could be used to explain the seemingly involuntary habitual actions of those deemed 'psychotic' or 'neurotic.' Conditional responses were, however, breakable, or in behaviorists terms 'extinguishable,' if one conditioned a new stimulus in place of the existing stimulus-response association.
Pavlov placed particular emphasis on the idea that his experiments were purely objective and not  open to observer influence, such as the experiments of the introspectivists. In fact, he closes his 1927 lectures with the bold claim that:
all the experiments, those of other workers as well as our own, which have set as their object a purely physiological interpretation of the activity of the higher nervous system, I regard as being in the nature only of a preliminary inquiry, which has however, I fully believe, entirely justified its inception. We have indisputably the right to claim that our investigation of this extraordinarily complex field has followed the right direction, and that, although not a near, nevertheless a complete, success awaits it.
The importance of Pavlov's theorizing should be obvious at this point: classical conditioning provided a physiological law-like relationship that could take the place of (provide the bodily substrate for) association of ideas. And it provides a mechanisms for creating, intervening in, or destroying those associations—which no previous theory had managed to do thus far.
American Psychology: William James and the function of consciousness
During this period of profound growth in psychology in Germany, American Universities were not institutions of Research, but institutions of liberal education. Starting in 1876 that started to change, when Johns Hopkins University was founded in Baltimore with the explicit mission of "The encouragement of research; the encouragement of young men; the advancement of individual scholars, who by their excellence will advance the sciences they pursue, and the society where they dwell."
Daniel Coit Gilman, the first President of Johns Hopkins admired the German university. Of the 53 men to the faculty of Hopkins by 1884, nearly all had been educated at German Universities, and 13 held what was then a German degree, the PhD Josiah Royce, progenitor of American Hegelianism, graduated from Hopkins in 1878. The few exceptions to this rule were the eminent American pragmatists John Dewey and C.S. Peirce.  
What followed can only be described as an explosion in research universities in America. Clark University was founded in 1887 and the University of Chicago in 1892.  In 1860, no PhDs were awarded in America. By 1890, 164 PhDs had been given.
I mention all of this because the German understanding of the science of the mind—specifically that of Helmholtz and his anti-vitalists—became synonymous with the understanding of research in Psychology during this period. In short, if one approached the mind in some fashion other than this experimental tradition, it simply was viewed as not contributing to research, and hence, was not considered suitable for graduate instruction. More often that not, advocates for views not in accordance with physiological-psychology were restricted to departments of philosophy or anthropology. A particularly good example of this kind of reasoning is G. Stanley Hall’s 1879 paper ‘Philosophy in the United States,’ in which he laments American Philosophy as little more than moral training in the Christian tradition.
In the middle of this storm sits William James. James, in many ways, bridges the divide between the older approach to liberal education and the new university approach to research. James’ accredits his interest in Psychology to his time spent in Germany, yet his entire career was spent teaching at the traditional college: Harvard. He advocated for experimentalists, but appeared to perform no psychological experiences himself. His students are the major figures in this first generation of research institutions and Psychology departments, including G. Stanley Hall; yet his position was always in the department of Philosophy, something he appeared to have insisted upon. James had a life-long friendship with the two Hopkins pragmatists, C.S. Peirce and John Dewey, who went on to supervise Christine Ladd-Franklin at Hopkins. Moreover, James was in frequent contact with the early British philosophers of mind including Alexander Bain, Herbert Spencer and John Sully.  
In 1878 James contracted with Henry Holt and company to write a textbook for this nascent field of psychology. The resultant book The Principles of Psychology is a classic in the field.  In it, James defines psychology as “the science of mental life, both of its phenomena and of their conditions” (1890, p. 1) and identified introspection as its chief method.
James held that consciousness (which was the central phenomenon to be studied by psychology) was like stream, encompassing much more than mere ‘associations’ of ideas. The associationists who followed Hume isolated experiences from their context, and provided a overly simplistic account. The object of study of psychology—the relations, tendencies and emotions that make up the stream of consciousness—are directly experienced in introspection, and form the basis of genuine scientific inquiry into the mind.
James' fellow pragmatists Peirce and Dewey went on to construct a theory of psychology focused on the  functions of mental states, what was called ultimately called “The Chicago School.” Dewey argued that explanations of human activity that focused merely on the 'stimulus' and 'response' or 'reflex arcs' were inadequate characterizations of conscious states. In order to truly characterize, and then study, conscious states, science must take into account the function or end of those states. In his words:
the distinction of sensation and movement as stimulus and response respectively is not a distinction which can be regarded as descriptive of anything which holds of psychical events or existences as such. The only events to which the terms stimulus and response can be descriptively applied are to minor acts serving by their respective positions to the maintenance of some organized coördination. The conscious stimulus or sensation, and the conscious response or motion, have a special genesis or motivation, and a special end or function. The reflex arc theory, by neglecting, by abstracting from, this genesis and this function gives us one disjointed part of a process as if it were the whole. (1896, p. 370)
Functional psychology thus emphasizes the role mental entities play in an organisms behavior, not what those ideas represent, or the 'content' of those ideas. (Dewey, 1903, p. 114)
Ebbinghaus and the unreliability of introspection
In or about 1878, inspired by Fechner's stunning results investigating sensation, Hermann Ebbinghaus started experimenting with memory. Ebbinghaus sought, like all of his contemporaries, to understand the association of ideas.  But he was worried, rightfully so, that using existing words or concepts in an experimental design would allow for the individual subject's previous experience with those words or concepts to influence the result of the experience. Thus, to isolate the association of ideas from any prior influence, he created long lists of nonsense syllables (VAM, ZOK, etc.) and set about memorizing them. He then precisely measured the number of repetitions or amount of time it took to repeat list perfectly, something he called trials to criterion.  As it turns out, the longer the list, the more time, or trials, it takes to memorize it.  But that wasn't all: he further tested the process of forgetting.
After some arbitrary period, Ebbinghaus would return to the same list and restart the entire process. If it took him the same number of repetitions to memorize the list to perfection, his forgetting would have been complete.  What Ebbinghaus found was that even if he could not introspectively recall items on the list after some time, it took fewer repetitions for him to learn the list to the criterion or perfection. Thus, a decade before Freud made it fashionable to believe in the unconscious, Ebbinghaus had demonstrated empirically that the mind could retain information that it could not bring to subjective, introspective awareness.
This discovery was a bombshell to the introspective protocols of Wundt and James. Pavlov had shown that 'unconscious' behaviors like salivation could be trained to a stimulus without the intervention of introspection, but Ebbinghaus showed that a paradigmatic psychological phenomenon—memory—was subject to the same training. While Ebbinghaus' work was originally published in 1885 in German, it Is little coincidence that it was translated into English in 1913, the same year Watson declared the beginning of the Behaviorist revolution.
First Revolution: Behaviorism
John B. Watson (1878-1958) opens his 1913 manifesto “Psychology as the Behaviorist Views it.” with the bold claim that Psychology
“is a purely objective branch of natural science. Its theoretical goal is the prediction and control of behavior. Introspection forms no essential part of its methods, nor is the scientific value of its data dependent upon the readiness with which they lend themselves to interpretation in terms of consciousness. The behaviorist, in his efforts to get a unitary scheme of animal response, recognizes no dividing line between man and brute. The behavior of man, with all of its refinement and complexity, forms only a part of the behaviorist's total scheme of investigation.” (1913, p. 158)
In his 1929 debate with the Harvard professor and physiological-psychologist William MacDougall (1871-1938), Watson anticipated a common criticism of behaviorism: that it cannot explain our rich interior mental life—what William James called the “stream of consciousness.” Watson responded that if we were to take the inner mental life as the object of study, rather than observable behaviors, there would be “as many analyses as there are individual psychologists. There is no element of control. There is no way of experimentally attaching and solving psychological problems and standardizing methods.” Thus, psychologists must limit themselves to “things that can be observed, and formulate laws concerning only the observed things.” (1929)
According to Watson, ‘observable things’ includes only “what the organism says or does,” which must then be described “in terms of ‘stimulus and response.’”  By ‘stimulus,’ Watson means “any object in the general environment or any change in the physiological condition of the animal, such as the change we get when we keep an animal from sex activity, when we keep it from feeding, when we keep it from building a nest. By response we mean that system of organized activity that we see emphasized anywhere in any kind of animal, as building a skyscraper, drawing plans, having babies, writing books, and the like.”
Watson’s behaviorism explains the behavior of all organisms (not just humans) by producing laws of correlation between stimuli and responses. This was a massive extension of the field of psychology, as animals and babies were not able to give introspective reports. Following Pavlov, Watson contends that an organism initially engages is some random behavior (say, a baby squirming) in response to a stimulus. This ‘unconditioned response’ may be biologically determined, but it is not yet a law of psychology.  To ‘condition’ a response, one presents the unconditioned stimulus along with a new stimulus repeatedly. Over time, the organism responds to the new, conditioned stimulus with the original unconditioned response. Thus, to explain any given behavior, one must find the conditioned stimulus that is now correlated with the conditioned response.
MacDougall, among others, challenged Watson to explain “thinking” or “thought”  in terms of stimulus and response.  Watson does not shy away from this challenge:
“The increasing dominance of language habits in the behavior of the developing child leads naturally over into the behaviorist's conception of thinking.  The behaviorist makes no mystery of thinking.  He holds that thinking is behavior, is motor organization, just like tennis playing or golf or any other form of muscular activity. But what kind of muscular activity? The muscular activity that he uses in talking. Thinking is merely talking, but talking with concealed musculature.”
According to Watson, a child initiates verbal behavior by talking aloud to and about his surroundings. As that behavior is negatively reinforced, it changes to mumbling to oneself, and ultimately to keeping one's lips closed. It follows that thinking is not an activity of the mind/brain alone, but a kinesthetic experience of the entire organism—in short, a behavior.  Words are, in Watson's view “the conditioned substitutes for our world of objects and acts. Thinking is a device for manipulating the world of objects when those objects are not present to the senses.”
Maturation: Tolman and Hull
During the middle of the 20th century, behaviorism in American divided roughly into two camps: Tolman and Hull. Edward Chace Tolman (1886 – 1959) initiated the 'war' in 1922 by criticizing  Watson. Tolman argued that Watson's belief that all human behavior could be explained in terms of “muscle contraction and grand secretion, as such, would not be behaviorism at all but a mere physiology.” (1922, p. 45)
For Tolman, a behavioristic science must answer three major problems: “(1), given the stimulating agency, determining the behavior-cues (2), given the behavior-cues, determining the behavior-object and (3), given the behavior-object, determining the behavior-act.” (p. 51).  (1) is the problem of psychophysics, which is adequately solved by Fechner. (2) is accessible, with rewording, by classical conditioning. (3) is the “important problem of motive.” A proper science of behavior must answer all three of these problems. Doing so, Tolman contends, would allow the behaviorist to understand and better elucidate introspection.
Opposing Tolman, Clark Hull (1884 – 1952) contended that in order for a postulate or theorem to be “truly scientific,” it must “take the form of specific statements of the outcome of concrete experimentations or observations.” Simple classification of behavior are not, themselves, scientific. But neither is talk of such things as motives.  Scientific explanations must make use of clear, unambiguous terms that refer to  observable behavior. Everything else is simply not considered to be 'science.' Hull contends that psychology should produce mathematical equations that would specify precisely all the  relationships between variables that account for an organisms behavior. The specific behavior of a given organism would be an instance of these universal mathematical generalizations.
Hull's primary contribution to behaviorism is the thesis that that the when a given stimulus has the effect of reducing a biological need, the connection between the stimulus and the response is strengthened automatically. While that statement may seem like a commonsense position today (food given as a reward, e.g.), the important part of it in 1935 was the word of 'automatically.' Contrary to the introspectivists or even commonsense, one need not be aware of the satiation of one's physical desires in order to strengthen the association between the conditioned stimulus and the conditional response. In fact, most conditioned associations are not accessible to introspective awareness.
Methodologically, Hull's insistence on the mathematical-deductive structure of theory led to a cadre of young psychologists who were able to represent complex relationships between variables mathematically.  Many members of that generation—including Roger Shepard—ended up at Stanford, ultimately providing much of the theory of information processing that allowed the cognitivists to advance sophisticated mathematical and computer models of cognitive states.
In response to Hull, Tolman argued that simple stimulus-response connections were insufficient to explain behavior: specifically rats running a maze for a food reward.  In his famous 1948 paper “Cognitive Maps in Rats and Men,” Tolman presented evidence that showed rats that were allowed to wander around a maze randomly before the beginning of training period learned the maze more quickly than rats that began training without prior exposure to the maze. Tolman argued that the best explanation for this phenomenon—and our general intuition about why rats appear to pause before beginning down a specific course—is that the rats have built up a 'cognitive map' of the maze through their random explorations.  He goes so far as to suggest that the rats had the ability to learn through 'Vicarious Trial and Error,' or 'imagining' what would happen if they responded to a particular stimulus.  For Tolman, this was:
evidence that in the critical stages-whether in the first picking up of the instructions or in the later making sure of which stimulus is which-the animal's activity is not just one of  responding passively to discrete stimuli, but rather one of the active selecting and comparing of stimuli. (1948, p. 200)
One of Tolman's students, Ritchie, constructed further experiments to test the capacity of the rats' cognitive maps. By starting rats on the far side of the laboratory, Ritchie found that the rats tended to navigate not by the direct path to the reward, but to the walls of the room itself. Thus, Tolman contends, the rats' cognitive maps were 'strip-like' and 'narrow.'
It is this concept—the breadth or narrowness of cognitive maps—that allows Tolman to extrapolate to the human mind, going so far to suggest that we may interpret the various psychological mechanisms posited by psychoanalysts as “narrowings of our cognitive maps due to too strong motivations or too intense frustration.” Thus, racists, sexists, pathological patriots, etc. are individuals with too narrow a 'cognitive map.' A healthy mind—and a well educated person—is one who can use reason, i.e. “broad cognitive maps” to
“look before and after, learning to see that there are often round-about and safer paths to their quite proper goals-learn, that is, to realize that the well-beings of White and of Negro, of Catholic and Protestant, of Christian and of Jew, of American and Russian (and even of males and females) are mutually interdependent.” (208)
Radical Behaviorism
Starting in 1938, Behaviorism underwent a radical transformation.  In that year, Burrhus Frederic Skinner (1904 – 1990) published The Behavior of Organisms: An Experimental Analysis, in which he introduced the idea of operant conditioning.  Skinner's insight was not entirely without precedent, but rather built upon the concept of 'instrumental conditioning' originally introduced by Edward Thorndike (1874-1949).  
According to what is now called 'Thorndike's law of effect', if a response is followed closely by a pleasurable experience, it is more likely to be associated with the stimulus than if it is followed by a unpleasurable or neutral experience. Skinner turned this idea into the central explanatory mechanism of behaviorism: rather than the conditioned stimulus occurring simultaneously with the unconditioned stimulus, the conditioning stimulus occurs immediately after the desired behavior as a consequence of the desired behavior. In his own words:
Operant behavior usually affects the environment and generates stimuli which is “feed back” to the organism. Some feedback may have the effects identified by the layman as reward or punishment.  Any consequence of behavior which is rewarding or, more technically, reinforcing increases the probability of further responding. (1957 / 1972, p. 129)
By introducing the idea of reinforcement of a behavior as whatever makes it more likely that that behavior will occur, Skinner was able to undercut Tolman's (and MacDougall's before him) insistence that a purpose or goal was required to explain the behavior of animals.
As a boy, Skinner was fascinated with mechanisms.  Legend has it that he even built a steam cannon out of a discarded water boiler. Extraordinarily intelligent, Skinner found Francis Bacon's works at about fourteen, and became enamored with the idea that Bacon may have written Shakespeare's plays.  He majored in English and literature at Hamilton College, where he became famous for elaborate practical jokes.  During his time at Hamilton, he expressed significant interest in the authors Joyce and Proust – but also physiological psychologists Pavlov and Jacques Loeb. Legend has it that he met Robert Frost, who encouraged him to become a writer.   After that did not pan out, he returned to behaviorism through the work of Bertrand Russell – specifically Russell's comparison between 'reflex' and 'force' in physics.
Inspired by Pavlov's maxim “control the environment and you will see order in behavior,” as well as his passion for inventing mechanisms, Skinner began to create machines that would control behavior of an organism by automatically rewarding the desired behavior and punishing behavior that was not desired.
These successes led Skinner to hypothesize that all animal behavior—including human behavior—resulted from such forces. He delineated four types of operant conditioning: positive reinforcement, negative reinforcement, punishment and extinction, which he studied with mathematical precision. Skinner shifted behaviorism's emphasis from reflexes to regularities of the whole organism, moving from the causal link between stimulus and response to the relationship between the response and its reinforcement.
According to Skinner, this form of behaviorism was the inevitable development of psychology into a full-fledged science. Often pulling on an analogy to the history of physics, chemistry and biology, he argued that 'consciousness' and 'inner causes' were the remnants of superstition, and human psychology and society could be perfected through the principles of operant conditioning.  
Skinner adamantly insisted that scientific inquiry could not countenance hypothetical unobservable entities. Following Russell, Skinner argued that explaining a given behavior, such as 'eating,' in terms of a mental state, such as 'being hungry,' was ad hoc, equivalent to the pre-scientific explanation of physical events in terms of vitalistic 'forces.'  For example, if I explain why a glass breaks by referring to it's fragility, I've really explained nothing at all—I've only explained breaking in terms of being likely to break.  A genuine explanation of a glass's breaking is in terms of the environmental conditions and events immediately prior to the breaking of the glass. Likewise, explaining eating in terms of 'hunger' is hollow, repeating only the likelihood of eating behavior.
 Throughout his career, Skinner argued that radical behaviorism alone was the scientific approach to psychology. Theories—including Hull's—cannot refer to underlying entities. When one objects that paradigmatic sciences like physics postulate unobservable underlying entities such as electrons, Skinner retorts that these are not believed by physics to really exist, but are merely convenient placeholders for the mathematical relationships that hold between observable entities. A scientist must restrict his or her work to observation, not theorizing. In retrospective appraisal of his own work, Skinner would claim of his work in Behavior of Organisms:
The notes, data, and publications which I have examined do not show that I ever behaved in the manner of Man Thinking as described by John Stuart Mill or John Dewey or in reconstructions of scientific behavior by other philosophers of science.  I never faced a Problem which was more than the eternal problem of finding order. I never attacked a problem by constructing a Hypothesis.  I never deduced Theorems or submitted them to Experimental Check. So far as I can see, I had no preconceived Mode of behavior—certainly not a physiological or mentalistic one and, I believe, not a conceptual one.” (1972, p. 112)
In the years following, Behaviorism came to utterly dominate American Psychology.  By 1960, for example, the standard textbook for experimental psychology, Burton G. Andreas' Experimental Psychology could confidently assert:
Psychology seeks to express the laws of behavior. It makes the assumption that all aspects of behavior, like other natural phenomena, are dependent on the conditions under which the behavior occurs... Psychology seeks to describe the dependence of the activities of people or animals on their environments and states of being. Psychology's place is delineated by this particular goal and the specific techniques devised for striving toward it. (1960, p. 4)
Concurrent developments: Logic and Computing
In 1812, George Boole (1815-1864) published The Laws of Thought, which is now regularly classified as a classic work in Logic. The opening paragraph, however, suggests a different discipline:
The design of the following treatise is to investigate the fundamental laws of those operations of the mind by which reasoning is performed; to give expression to them in the symbolic language of a Calculus, and upon this foundation to establish the science of Logic and construct its method; to make that method itself the basis of a general method for the application of the mathematical doctrine of Probabilities; and, finally, to collect from the various elements of truth brought to view in the course of these inquiries some probable intimations concerning the nature and constitution of the human mind. -- Laws of Thought (1854) Ch1 Para1
Boole, like his predecessor David Hume, believed that the rules that regulate the human mind were simple, and complex ideas were structured out of simple ones in the same way complex theorems are constructed out of simple axioms via logical transformations.
The history of Logic is of great importance here because in 1950, a brilliant young logician named Alan Turing proposed a theoretical physical machine that would be capable of carrying out logical functions.  That theoretical machine ultimately became the digital computer we know today.
He further proposed that such a machine could be taught to understand human language, and one could test the sophistication of that teaching by a simple empirical test, now known as the 'Turing test.'  An interviewer would have a conversation with two individuals, one human and one computer, for a period of time. If, after five minutes or so, the interviewer could not tell the difference between the two, we would be in a position of calling the machine a 'thinking' machine.  According to Turing:
“I believe that in about fifty years' time it will be possible, to programme computers, with a storage capacity of about 109, to make them play the imitation game so well that an average interrogator will not have more than 70 per cent chance of making the right identification after five minutes of questioning.”
In short, Turing's ideal machine would 'respond to the sense of all that will be said in its presence, as even the dullest men can do.'   The challenge set by Descartes and dreamt about by Hobbes, Locke and Hume to create a physical device capable of using language in a productive and systematic way was met, at least, theoretically, by the digital computer.
The question that remains for you, in the course of this game, is whether or not Turing's discovery of the logical functions that meet Descartes' challenge in fact lead to, in Boole's words “probable intimations concerning the nature and constitution of the human mind,” and whether or not those 'probable intimations' are scientific in nature.
Second Revolution: Cognitive Science
In 1957, two books were published on the topic of language use by humans. As we've discussed, philosophers of mind have long considered language-use the defining characteristic of humanity.  The empirical study of language-use therefore, has the potential to quantify, analyze and observe, with scientific reliability, what we are as human beings.
In the first, Verbal Behavior, B.F. Skinner explained humans' language use in terms of operant conditioning.  Verbal behavior is particularly interesting for the behaviorist because it isn't directly reinforced by the world, but rather mediated by another person via his or her own verbal behavior. In fact, this unique feature comes to form Skinner's definition of verbal behaviors: those behaviors that are 'reinforced through the mediation of other persons' (1957, p. 2). He later refines and restricts that definition thus: “If we make the further provision that the 'listener' must be responding in ways which have been conditioned precisely in order to reinforce the behavior of the speaker, we narrow our subject to what is traditionally recognized as the verbal field.” (p. 225) This definition, you'll no doubt notice, makes no reference to vocalization, words, sentences, thoughts, phonems, meanings, semantics, grammar, or anything else typically associated with language-behavior.
The second was Noam Chomsky's Syntactic Structures. Chomsky opens his first masterwork by noting that the set of all grammatical sentences in any given language, while infinite, is not random. There are sentences like 'Colorless green ideas sleep furiously' which may have never occurred in English before 1957, but nonetheless are grammatical sentences; while at the same time, there are sentences like 'Furiously sleep ideas green colorless' that are not grammatical. He then proposes that an adequate theory of language ought to describe a device that generates all and only the sentences that are grammatical in that language. Any theory that can't generate the set of grammatical sentences simply is not an adequate explanation of human language-behavior.
Central to Chomsky's theory is the thesis that humans differ from animals in their ability to use language. You'll remember from the beginning of this history that that view was shared by Rene Descartes and the Port-Royalists, who used it to argue for the distinction between the soul (mind) and the body.  It is not a view held by the Behaviorists.  For Chomsky, however, the ability to use language does not entail a non-physical being. Turing's machines showed that a physical entitled generate new and novel sentences that follow the grammatical structures. Verbal behavior, the defining feature of human psychology, is the ability to structure sentences in new and novel ways via the process of recursion, but that does not mean that human minds are non-physical entities.
Not only do the cognitivists reject the behaviorists conjecture that one can explain human behavior without reference to internal states, they reject the behaviorists rejection of the thesis that there is a dividing like between “man and brutes.”
In 1959, Chomsky published a vitriolic review of Skinner's Verbal Behavior, in which he claimed that not only were Skinner's definitions of reinforcement and conditioning either confused or circular, he argues that empirically, children learn grammar at a higher rate than can be explained by operant conditioning. It is included in the appendix.
In the decade before these tumultuous years, The Macy foundation had sponsored series of conferences that introduced some of great early mathematicians and computer scientists including John von Neumann (father of most computer languages), Norbert Wiener (founder of cybernetics), Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts (who together created a mathematical model of a neuron, which is the basis for all neural network architecture), Julian Bigelow and Arutuo Rosenblueth (also pioneering cyberneticists) to the great social scientists and psychologists of the day, including the anthropologist Margaret Mead, the Gestalt psychologist Wolfgang Köhler among others. The goal of these workshops was to investigate the similarities between computational machines and human minds and social structures.  Behaviorists almost never attended. While the results from these conferences were minimal, they set the stage for MIT's second Symposium on Information theory, September 10-12 1956, that forever changed forever the face of psychology.  
At that conference, Alan Newell and Herbert Simon, the great computer scientists from Carnegie-Melon, presented a simple machine that could do logic proofs and Noam Chomsky presented his idea of a transformative-generative grammar as the basis of language. George Miller writes, in an unpublished paper presented at MIT and repeatedly cited by historians of cognitive science, that he came away from the conference with a sense “more intuitive than rational, that human experimental psychology, theoretical linguistics, and the computer simulation of the cognitive process were all the pieces from a larger whole, and that the future would see a progressive elaboration and coordination of their shared concerns.”  Miller recalls Newell telling him “Chomsky was developing exactly the same kind of ideas for language that he and Herb Simon were developing for theorem-proving.”
And so began 'the Cognitive Revolution”.

Playing a Psychologist or Psychiatrist in the 1970s.
Unlike many other professional organizations of the late 19th century, the APA immediately granted membership to women: specifically the eminent experimental psychophysicist Christine Ladd-Franklin and Margaret Washburn in 1894, two years after its founding. Mary Whiton Calkins was the first woman elected the first president in 1905.
In 1964, a magazine called Fact asked 12,000 psychiatrists if they would be willing to diagnose conservative presidential candidate Barry Goldwater. Of the more than 2000 that responded 1,189 responded that he appeared to have a 'personality disorder'--that slippery category between psychosis and neurosis.  The headline proclaimed (under the magazine's title 'fact:') that “1,198 Psychiatrists Say Goldwater Is Psychologically Unfit To Be President! You'll recall that the 1964 election witnessed Johnson's famous 'Daisy' ad, which suggested that the election of Barry Goldwater would lead to nuclear annihilation.  
In 1969, the American Psychological Association issued a public proclamation, citing lack of evidence to the contrary that:
WHEREAS in many state legislature, bills have recently been introduced for the purpose of repealing or drastically modifying the existing criminal codes with respect to the termination of unwanted pregnancies; and whereas, termination of unwanted pregnancies is clearly a mental health and child welfare issue, and a legitimate concern of APA; be it resolved, that termination of pregnancy be considered a civil right of the pregnant woman, to be handled as other medical and surgical procedures in consultation with her physician, and to be considered legal if performed by a licensed physician in a licensed medical facility.

The American Psychiatric Association followed in 1977 with:
The emotional consequences of unwanted pregnancy on parents and their offspring may lead to long-standing life distress and disability, and the children of unwanted pregnancies are at high risk for abuse, neglect, mental illness, and deprivation of the quality of life. Pregnancy that results from undue coercion, rape, or incest creates even greater potential distress or disability in the child and the parents. The adolescent most vulnerable to early pregnancy is the product of adverse sociocultural conditions involving poverty, discrimination, and family disorganization, and statistics indicate that the resulting pregnancy is laden with medical complications which threaten the well-being of mother and fetus. The delivery that ensues from teenage pregnancy is prone to prematurity and major threats to the health of mother and child, and the resulting newborns have a higher percentage of birth defects, developmental difficulties, and a poorer life and health expectancy than the average for our society. Such children are often not released for adoption and thus get caught in the web of foster care and welfare systems, possibly entering lifetimes of dependency and costly social interventions. The tendency of this pattern to pass from generation to generation is very marked and thus serves to perpetuate a cycle of social and educational failure, mental and physical illness, and serious delinquency.
Because of these considerations, and in the interest of public welfare, the American Psychiatric Association
1)	opposes all constitutional amendments, legislation, and regulations curtailing family planning and abortion services to any segment of the population; 2) reaffirms its position that abortion is a medical procedure in which physicians should respect the patient's right to freedom of choice - psychiatrists may be called on as consultants to the patient or physician in those cases in which the patient or physician requests such consultation to expand mutual appreciation of motivation and consequences; and 3) affirms that the freedom to act to interrupt pregnancy must be considered a mental health imperative with major social and mental health implications.
You'll recall that the US Supreme court decided that abortion was covered by the constitutional dictate to a 'right to privacy,' thereby blocking all laws that had kept abortion illegal.
Needless to say, not only were these political events were hugely controversial in the United States, the professional involvement of psychiatrists and psychologists was itself hugely controversial. The 'Goldwater affair', as it became to be known, embarrassed Psychiatry as a whole, painting the entire discipline as either politically motivated and unreliable (in the technical sense, that the same individual would not be classified the same way by a different analysts).  And the abortion declarations were widely seen as unmotivated by scientific evidence.

            <Comments>The four idols distinguished by Bacon are the idols of the tribe, the cave, the marketplace and the theater.  The idols of the tribe are those which we all share, as a function of our biology. They “have their origin either in the regularity of the substance of the human spirit; or in its prejudices; or in its limitations; or in its restless movement; or in the influence of the emotions; or in the limited powers of the senses; or in the mode of impression” (LII)
The idols of the cave are those of an individual. They have their origin in “the individual nature of each man's mind and body; and also in his education, way of life and chance events.” (LIII)
The idols of the marketplace are those of miscommunication and misunderstanding. As Bacon says “For men believe that their reason controls words. But it is also true that words retort and turn their force back upon the understanding; and this has rendered philosophy and the science sophistic and unproductive.” (LIX)
The idols of the theater are those of intellectual 'showmanship.' They are “not innate or stealthily slipped into the understanding; they are openly introduced and accepted on the basis of fairytale theories and mistaken rules of proof.” (LXI)
All quotes from Bacon &amp; Jardin (2000).  Roman numerals indicate Aphorism number.
Bacon lists 27 different types of these 'privileged instances' in Book 2 of his Novum Organon.
If you aren't familiar with the argument, you can read it, in Latin English and French, here: http://www.wright.edu/cola/descartes/
There are many instances of this claim in the history of psychology: see, e.g. Wundt, 1876 (p. 175)
I can illustrate some of the differences in theoretical approach here with the example of color perception: Helmholtz posited that there were three basic primary colors: red, green and purple.  Ladd-Franklin argued that purple perceptually appeared to be (i.e. ‘looked like’) a mixture of red and blue, whereas yellow appeared to be primary. Thus, she theorized, there are in fact four psychologically primary colors: red, green, blue and yellow.  Helmholtz responded (quoted in Hering) that one could not draw conclusions about facts of physiology from direct psychological experience (i.e. introspection), therefore Ladd-Franklin’s observation had no bearing on the science of psychology.  While Ladd-Franklin’s point seems obvious and definitive against Helmholtz’s theory, it was widely rejected, on the basis of the unreliability of introspective reports and observations, in favor of the physiological reductionism of Helmholtz. In fact, it wasn’t until a plausible mathematical model based on Ladd-Franklin’s observation was proposed by Jameson and Hurvich in 1957 that the psychological community rejected Helmholtz’s theory in favor of Ladd-Franklin’s.
I am skipping, for the sake of space, the fascinating history of British psychology during this period, as it adapted associationism to the new physiology. See Daston, L.J. (1978). “British Response to Psycho-Physiology 1860-1900.” The History of Science Society 69 (2) p. 192-208
And the ‘German Mind’ apparently: “The thoroughness of the German mind, its desire for perfection in every detail, and its philosophical aptitudes are well illustrated by the controversies now in vogue in the land of universities.”(http://webapps.jhu.edu/jhuniverse/information_about_hopkins/about_jhu/daniel_coit_gilman/)
See Ch. V of Miller (1962)
(Miller, 1962, p. 66) argues that “If Watson had not been so inept as a philosopher, he might have offered behaviorism as a pragmatic theory of mind, comparable to Peirce’s pragmatic theory of meaning, James’ pragmatic theory of truth, and Dewey’s pragmatic theory of value.”
In the interests of conciseness, I am skipping over the fascinating and under-rated history of Gestalt psychology. I do this with a heavy heart, as it is one of my favorite topics in the history of psychology. Characters who wish to engage with the tradition of behaviorism, however, should pay careful attention to Wolfgang Köhler's presidential address, included in the appendix, for the Gestalt concerns about this period in American Psychology's history.
This is only one of Hull's four criteria. The other are: (1) The definitions and postulates of a scientific system should be stated in a clear and unambiguous manner, they should be consistent with one another, and they should be of such a nature that they permit rigorous deductions. (2) The labor of deducing the potential implications of the postulates of a system should be performed with meticulous care and exhibited, preferably step by step and in full detail. It is these deductions which constitute the substance of a system. (4) The theorems so deduced which concern phenomena not already known must be submitted to carefully controlled experiments. The outcome of these critical experiments, as well as all previous ones, must agree with the corresponding theorems making up the system.
See the section on behaviorism in the 'Public Character info' section for more on the difference between operant and classical conditioning.
“Gradually it was found that all the equations could be written down without bringing in forces. What was observable was a certain relation between acceleration and configuration; to say that this relation was drought about by the intermediacy of 'force' was to add nothing to our knowledge. Observation shows that planets have at all times an acceleration towards the sun, which varies inversely as the square of their distance from it.  To say that this is due to the 'force' of gravitation is merely verbal, like saying that opium makes people sleep because it has a dormitive virtue. The modern physicist, therefore, merely states formulae which determine accelerations, and avoids the word 'force' altogether. 'Force' was the faint ghost of the vitalist view as to the causes of motions, and gradually the ghost has been exorcized.” (Russell, 1946, p 495)
See, e.g. interview with Skinner, p. 39 pf Baars.

Titchener, who was a founding member of the APA but probably never attended a meeting, created a separate organization called the “Experimentalists” in 1904, from which he explicitly barred women. Christine Ladd-Franking engaged in high profile war of words with Titchener until his death in 1925. Unfortunately, many people misremember this conflict as happening in the APA, which is incorrect. Also unfortunately, Titchener's student E.G. Boring wrote the most famous history of experimental psychology, in which he attacks Christine Ladd-Franklin as 'invading' laboratories and 'the women graduate students manicure her fingers' in the laboratory.

Brief History of Homosexuality in America
While homosexual behavior has appeared throughout human history, the notion of homosexuality as an orientation or personality is relatively recent.  The etymology of the word 'homosexual' itself shows the intimate connection between the idea of sexual orientation and the history of psychiatry.  According to the OED, the term first appears in print in English in C. G. Chaddock translation of R. von Krafft-Ebing 1892 Psychopathia Sexualis. Relevant sections are reproduced in the appendix.
The idea of homosexuality as a lifestyle is, in the English speaking world at least, indelibly linked to the public persona of Oscar Wilde. Wilde was a flamboyant public figure, known for dressing immaculately and flamboyantly, his sharp wit and his talent at dinner conversation.  While he was studying classics at Oxford, he began advocating aestheticism, the view that aesthetic values trump moral or social values in the understanding of art and literature. In 1895, he and his companion Alfred Taylor were convicted of acts of 'gross indecency' and sentenced to two years hard labor.
Their trial was 'the trial of the century' in the English upper-class, and to this day, many of Wilde's personal characteristics inform the common stereotypes of homosexual men. For example:   fastidiousness with respect to personal appearance, extraordinary wittiness and social adeptness, esp. with upper-class women, are all traceable to Wilde himself.
The next fifty years were not kind to gay folks.  “Treatments” for homosexuals included surgical interventions such as castration, vasectomies, lobotomies, sterilization, clitoridectomies, hysterectomies; chemical interventions such as sexual stimulants, depressants, hormonal injections, and pharmacological shock; psychological interventions included adjustment therapy, psychoanalysis, hypnosis, aversion therapy that included electric shock and desensitization; and social psychological interventions patterned on Alcoholics Anonymous like 'Homosexuals Anonymous' and others.
One of the saddest stories of this era is that of Alan Turing, who I mentioned in the previous section. Turing was one of the greatest mathematicians and logicians of his era, if not the greatest. During WWII, he worked at Bletchley park as one of Churchill's famed code-breakers. His efforts in breaking the German codes lead directly to the development of modern logic and the invention of the electronic computer. He is generally considered to be the founder of both modern cryptography and computer science.  Quite literally, Turing is to the contemporary information age what Newton was to the age of mechanics.
But Turing was also gay. In 1952, he was prosecuted and convicted for being a homosexual. Sentenced to hormone therapy and stripped of his military clearance, he committed suicide on June 7th, 1954. In 2009, the British Government started a program of accepting online petitions from citizens of the UK. One of the first to be submitted, and promoted by Richard Dawkins, was a call for an official apology to Alan Turing for unjust prosecution. On 10 September 2009, Prime Minister Gordon Brown issued a formal apology to Alan Turing, stating:
It is thanks to men and women who were totally committed to fighting fascism, people like Alan Turing, that the horrors of the Holocaust and of total war are part of Europe’s history and not Europe’s present.
So on behalf of the British government, and all those who live freely thanks to Alan’s work I am very proud to say: we’re sorry, you deserved so much better.
During this period, advocates for homosexuals (at this time called 'homophile' organizations) focused primarily on changing the stereotypes of the homosexual as a step towards ending  the criminalization of homosexual acts as well as the psychological and medical 'treatments.'  There was little activity within the scientific and academic communities on this issue. That all started to change when a young social psychologist named Evelyn Hooker started teaching at UCLA.
During WWII, young men and women who were accused of homosexuality in Pacific theater of operations for the US Military tended to be discharged in California ports, including San Diego, Long Beach and San Francisco. Many, if not most, of these young people could not return to their hometowns because of their dishonorable discharge from the military. As a result, a organic community of homosexuals began taking shape in many of these cities.
Hooker became friends with one of her graduate students, Sam Fromm. Sam was gay. In 1943, he challenged her to study 'people like him' to determine if they were mentally ill (specifically 'neurotic') independently of the biases against homosexuality inherent in the psychiatric tradition. In a 1998 interview, Hooker explained the significance of this phrase:
 “This bright young man, somewhere in his early thirties, had obviously been thinking about this for a long time. And by ‘people like us’ he meant, ‘We’re homosexual, but we don’t need psychiatrists. We don’t need psychologists. We’re not insane. We’re not any of those things they say we are.” (Eric Marcus, Windy City Times, October 31, 2007 • vol 23 no 07)
During the 1940's, Evelyn Hooker became a trusted 'outsider' of the gay community in L.A., but didn't want to conduct research on people she saw as her friends.
Kinsey
In 1948, Alfred C. Kinsey (1894 – August 25, 1956) published Sexual Behavior in the Human Male. It was revolutionary.
Kinsey and his assistants had interviewed  5300 white males from all walks of American life. The interviews required up to 521 questions, depending on the interviewees experiences, with the average being around 300.  Kinsey reported that a large number of men—up to 45%—reported having at least one homosexual encounter during his adolescence.  These encounters are most frequent at young age, dropping to a stable 10% of the population by age 20-25. These numbers, Kinsey fears, may not tell the whole story because:
The social significance of the homosexual is considerably emphasized by the fact that both Jewish and Christian churches have considered this aspect of human sexuality to be abnormal and immoral. … Social custom and our Anglo-American law are sometimes very severe in penalizing one who is discovered to have had homosexual relations. In consequence, many persons who have had such experiences are psychically disturbed, and not a few of them have been in open conflict with the social organization. (p. 610)
The Kinsey report found that homosexual activity as a common part of male sexual development.  Self-identifying as a homosexual, or engaging exclusively in homosexual activity, was found to be more rare. But at 10%, almost twice as high as any previous scientific estimate. Almost as importantly, he identified the source of psychic disturbance not to be the homosexual activity itself, but the social structures that penalize such behavior.
Early 'Homophile' movements
Two years after the publication of the Kinsey report, a group of 'homophile' activists founded the Mattachine society, which is now generally recognized as the first national gay-rights organization. The Mattachine society, named for a European tradition of theater masks, sought to change the prevailing view of homosexuality by presenting the membership as no different than the mainstream heterosexual society. Its members dressed in suits and skirts, and showed no 'outward signs' of homosexuality. These 'outward signs' are, of course, those stereotypes we identified as originating with Oscar Wilde. Mattachine society demonstrations—held annually in front of Independence Hall in Philadelphia on July 4th—were sober affairs of men in gray suits and women in dresses walking up and down in straight lines.
The Daughters of Bilitis were a secret social club for Lesbians founded in San Franscisco in the 1950s by Del Martin and Phyllis Lyon. To stay in touch with its members, it created a magazine called 'The Ladder', which came under the editorship of Barbara Gittings in 1963. It flourished under Gittings' direction, growing from a simple hand-stapled newsletter to a true 40-page magazine.
Connecting the dots: Evelyn Hooker
After the publication of the Kinsey report, Hooker finally decided to meet Fromm's challenge. She designed an experiment to determine if homosexuals were mentally disturbed.  In 1954, she received a grant from the National Institute on Mental Health to run her study. She recruited 30 homosexuals the Mattachine society as well as the gay community generally. An equal number of heterosexual men were recruited from civil organizations around the city. Individuals in the groups were matched with respect to age, IQ and education level. All people currently in therapy for mental health were excluded from the study.  This alone was a major step forward in the study of male homosexuality, as all previous psychological studies had found their subjects in psychiatric wards, army barracks or clinical settings.
Hooker tested the resulting 60 men using standard psychological tests: the Rorschach, Thematic Apperception Test (TAT) and the Make-A-Picture-Story Test (MAPS). The data was sent to psychologists who were experts on reading these tests, and the tests scored.  Hooker found no significant difference was found between the groups, indicating that homosexual men were no more likely to have mental disturbances (i.e. to be neurotic) than equivalent heterosexual men.
Hooker presented her findings at the 1956 APA in Chicago. Her paper was published in 1957, shortly after Sam Fromm's death.
Stonewall: The street activists


By the 1960s, tensions were growing in the gay community. Another group of younger gay activists were growing irritated with both the slow progress of the Mattachine society and its restrictions on behavior. In 1968, a group of young 'street-activists' disrupted a meeting of the American Medical Association in New York by shouting down Charles Socarides, a Psychiatrist known for his psychoanalytic treatment of homosexuals.
Everything changed forever on Saturday, June 28, 1969 at 1:20 AM, when the police raided the Stonewall Inn in Greenwich Village. The gay and lesbian patrons of the Stonewall resisted arrest. Events escalated. The riots that followed lasted until Wednesday night, July 3rd. 
On the Fourth, the gay community’s attention turned to Independence Hall in Philadelphia and the Mattachine society’s annual march. As usual, Frank Kameny and Barbara Gittings, long time leaders of that gay and lesbian advocacy group, required the women to wear skirts and men suits. When couples held hands, Kameny famously scolded “None of that!” But the tide had turned. The young protestors from Stonewall would not conform. Kameny’s approach of assimilation had been surpassed by the direct action begun at Stonewall. Militant groups such as the Gay Liberation Front and the Gay Activist Alliance sprouted up across the country overnight (both started in New York). Plans were made to confront those who continued to classify homosexuality as a mental disorder, and directly challenge those who continued to treat homosexuals using barbaric methods.
And those plans included San Francisco, site of the 1970 American Psychiatric Association’s annual convention. And you already know what happened there.

            <Comments>In Victorian England, 'gross indecency' was defined as sexual acts between men that did not rise to the level of 'buggery'.
There is a superb website in the UK that is collecting stories of patients, doctors and nurses from this era. All are deeply disturbing, some downright terrifying.  See http://treatmenthomosexuality.co.uk/.  I'll quote just one example here, as it so perfectly illustrates classical conditioning:
“We need to remember that the discussions that went on at Maudsley in the early 50s were constantly searching for ways in which we could understand the relationship between events, so again referring to the ideas put forward by Pavlov, Skinner and Wolpe, if a situation produces anxiety and at the same time there is another even occurring then buy the process of conditioning it's quite likely that the reaction of  anxiety will become associated with the unconditioned stimulus. By thinking along those lines it seemed to me that if the process of sexual arousal and gratification is linked with something, it may well become the preferred method of seeking gratification. It seemed to me that if a person wanted to stop being involved in and interested in make figures—so long as he had bisexual potential or interests—we might be able to utilize the other half of the spectrum of potential arousal signals. And, if we did that often enough, he then might be gratified by femininity.”

The use of the word 'gay' as a replacement for 'homosexual' dates from precisely this time with precisely these people.

Verbal behavior. By B. F. SKINNER.(The Century Psychology Series.) Pp. viii, 478. New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts, Inc., 1957.

1. A great many linguists and philosophers concerned with language have expressed the hope that their studies might ultimately be embedded in a frame- work provided by behaviorist psychology, and that refractory areas of investi- gation, particularly those in which meaning is involved, will in this way be opened up to fruitful exploration. Since this volume is the first large-scale attempt to incorporate the major aspects of linguistic behavior within a behaviorist frame- work, it merits and will undoubtedly receive careful attention. Skinner is noted for his contributions to the study of animal behavior. The book under review is the product of study of linguistic behavior extending over more than twenty years. Earlier versions of it have been fairly widely circulated, and there are quite a few references in the psychological literature to its major ideas.
The problem to which this book is addressed is that of giving a 'functional analysis' of verbal behavior. By functional analysis, Skinner means identifica- tion of the variables that control this behavior and specification of how they interact to determine a particular verbal response. Furthermore, the controlling variables are to be described completely in terms of such notions as stimulus, reinforcement, deprivation, which have been given a reasonably clear meaning in animal experimentation. In other words, the goal of the book is to provide a way to predict and control verbal behavior by observing and manipulating the physical environment of the speaker.
Skinner feels that recent advances in the laboratory study of animal behavior permit us to approach this problem with a certain optimism, since 'the basic processes and relations which give verbal behavior its special characteristics are now fairly well understood ... the results [of this experimental work] have been surprisingly free of species restrictions. Recent work has shown that the methods can be extended to human behavior without serious modification' (3).1
1 Skinner's confidence in recent achievements in the study of animal behavior and their applicability to complex human behavior does not appear to be widely shared. In many recent publications of confirmedbehaviorists there is a prevailing note of skepticism with regard to the scope of these achievements. For representative comments, see the contribu- tionstoModernlearningtheory(byEstesetal.;NewYork,1954);Bugelski,Psychologyof learning (New York, 1956);Koch, in Nebraskasymposiumon motivation58 (Lincoln, 1956); Verplanck, Learned and innate behavior, Psych. rev. 52.139 (1955). Perhaps the strongest view is that of Harlow, who has asserted (Mice, monkeys, men, and motives, Psych. rev. 60.23-32 [1953])that 'a strong case can be made for the proposition that the importance of the psychological problems studied during the last 15 years has decreased as a negatively accelerated function approaching an asymptote of complete indifference.' Tinbergen, a leading representative of a different approach to animal behavior studies (comparative ethology), concludes a discussion of 'functional analysis' with the comment that 'we may

It is important to see clearly just what it is in Skinner's program and claims that makes them appear so bold and remarkable. It is not primarily the fact that he has set functional analysis as his problem, or that he limits himself to study of 'observables', i.e. input-output relations. What is so surprising is the particular limitations he has imposed on the way in which the observables of behavior are to be studied, and, above all, the particularly simple nature of the 'function' which, he claims, describes the causation of behavior. One would naturally expect that prediction of the behavior of a complex organism (or machine) would require, in addition to information about external stimulation, knowledge of the internal structure of the organism, the ways in which it proc- esses input information and organizes its own behavior. These characteristics of the organism are in general a complicated product of inborn structure, the genetically determined course of maturation, and past experience. Insofar as independent neurophysiological evidence is not available, it is obvious that inferences concerning the structure of the organism are based on observation of behavior and outside events. Nevertheless, one's estimate of the relative im- portance of external factors and internal structure in the determination of be- havior will have an important effect on the direction of research on linguistic
(or any other) behavior, and on the kinds of analogies from animal behavior studies that will be considered relevant or suggestive.
Putting it differently, anyone who sets himself the problem of analyzing the causation of behavior will (in the absence of independent neurophysiological evidence) concern himself with the only data available, namely the record of inputs to the organism and the organism's present response, and will try to describe the function specifying the response in terms of the history of inputs. This is nothing more than the definition of his problem. There are no possible grounds for argument here, if one accepts the problem as legitimate, though Skinner has often advanced and defended this definition of a problem as if it were a thesis which other investigators reject. The differences that arise between those who affirmand those who deny the importance of the specific 'contribution of the organism' to learning and performance concern the particular character and complexity of this function, and the kinds of observations and research necessary for arriving at a precise specification of it. If the contribution of the organism is complex, the only hope of predicting behavior even in a gross way
will be through a very indirect program of research that begins by studying the detailed cha.acter of the behavior itself and the particular capacities of the organism involved.
Skinner's thesis is that external factors consisting of present stimulation and the history of reinforcement (in particular the frequency, arrangement, and withholding of reinforcing stimuli) are of overwhelming importance, and that the general principles revealed in laboratory studies of these phenomena pro- vide the basis for understanding the complexities of verbal behavior. He confi-
now draw the conclusion that the causation of behavior is immensely more complex than was assumed in the generalizations of the past. A number of internal and external factors act upon complex central nervous structures. Second, it will be obvious that the facts at our disposal are very fragmentary indeed'-The study of instinct 74 (Oxford, 1951).

dently and repeatedly voices his claim to have demonstrated that the contri- bution of the speaker is quite trivial and elementary, and that precise prediction of verbal behavior involves only specification of the few external factors that he has isolated experimentally with lower organisms.
Careful study of this book (and of the research on which it draws) reveals, however, that these astonishing claims are far from justified. It indicates, fur- thermore, that the insights that have been achieved in the laboratories of the reinforcement theorist, though quite genuine, can be applied to complex human behavior only in the most gross and superficial way, and that speculative attempts to discuss linguistic behavior in these terms alone omit from con- sideration factors of fundamental importance that are, no doubt, amenable to scientific study, although their specific character cannot at present be precisely formulated. Since Skinner's work is the most extensive attempt to accommodate human behavior involving higher mental faculties within a strict behaviorist schema of the type that has attracted many linguists and philosophers, as well as psychologists, a detailed documentation is of independent interest. The mag- nitude of the failure of this attempt to account for verbal behavior serves as a kind of measure of the importance of the factors omitted from consideration, and an indication of how little is really known about this remarkably complex phenomenon.
The force of Skinner's argument lies in the enormous wealth and range of examples for which he proposes a functional analysis. The only way to evaluate the success of his program and the correctness of his basic assumptions about verbal behavior is to review these examples in detail and to determine the pre- cise character of the concepts in terms of which the functional analysis is pre- sented. ?2 of this review describes the experimental context with respect to which these concepts are originally defined. ??3-4 deal with the basic concepts 'stimulus', 'response', and 'reinforcement', ??6-10 with the new descriptive machinery developed specifically for the description of verbal behavior. In ?5 we consider the status of the fundamental claim, drawn from the laboratory, which serves as the basis for the analogic guesses about human behavior that have been proposed by many psychologists. The final section (?11) will consider some ways in which further linguistic work may play a part in clarifying some of these problems.
2. Although this book makes no direct reference to experimental work, it can be understood only in terms of the general framework that Skinner has developed for the description of behavior. Skinner divides the responses of the animal into two main categories. Respondentsare purely reflex responses elicited by particular stimuli. Operants are emitted responses, for which no obvious stimulus can be discovered. Skinner has been concerned primarily with operant behavior. The experimental arrangement that he introduced consists basically of a box with a bar attached to one wall in such a way that when the bar is pressed, a food pellet is dropped into a tray (and the bar press is recorded). A rat placed in the box will soon press the bar, releasing a pellet into the tray. This state of affairs, resulting from the bar press, increases the strengthof the bar-
￼REVIEWS 29
pressing operant. The food pellet is called a reinforcer;the event, a reinforcing event. The strength of an operant is defined by Skinner in terms of the rate of response during extinction (i.e. after the last reinforcement and before return to the preconditioning rate).
Suppose that release of the pellet is conditional on the flashing of a light. Then the rat will come to press the bar only when the light flashes. This is called stimulus discrimination. The response is called a discriminated operant and the light is called the occasionfor its emission; this is to be distinguished from elicita- tion of a response by a stimulus in the case of the respondent.2Suppose that the apparatus is so arranged that bar-pressing of only a certain character (e.g. duration) will release the pellet. The rat will then come to press the bar in the required way. This process is called response differentiation.By successive slight changes in the conditions under which the response will be reinforced it is pos-
sible to shape the response of a rat or a pigeon in very surprising ways in a very short time, so that rather complex behavior can be produced by a process of successive approximation.
A stimulus can become reinforcing by repeated association with an already reinforcing stimulus. Such a stimulus is called a secondaryreinforcer.Like many contemporary behaviorists, Skinner considers money, approval, and the like to be secondary reinforcers which have become reinforcing because of their associa- tion with food etc.3 Secondary reinforcers can be generalizedby associating them with a variety of different primary reinforcers.
Another variable that can affect the rate of the bar-pressing operant is drive, which Skinner defines operationally in terms of hours of deprivation. His major scientific book, Behavior of organisms, is a study of the effects of food-depriva- tion and conditioning on the strength of the bar-pressing response of healthy mature rats. Probably Skinner's most original contribution to animal behavior studies has been his investigation of the effects of intermittent reinforcement, arranged in various different ways, presented in Behavior of organisms and ex- tended (with pecking of pigeons as the operant under investigation) in the re- cent Schedules of reinforcementby Ferster and Skinner (1957). It is apparently
2InBehavioroforganisms(NewYork,1938),Skinnerremarksthat'althoughacondi- tioned operant is the result of the correlation of the response with a particular reinforce- ment, a relation between it and a discriminative stimulus acting prior to the response is the almost universal rule' (178-9). Even emitted behavior is held to be produced by some sort of
'originating force' (51) which, in the case of operant behavior is not under experimental control. The distinction between eliciting stimuli, discriminated stimuli, and 'originating forces' has never been adequately clarified, and becomes even more confusing when private internal events are considered to be discriminated stimuli (see below).
3 In a famous experiment, chimpanzees were taught to perform complex tasks to receive tokens which had become secondary reinforcers because of association with food. The idea that money, approval, prestige, etc. actually acquire their motivating effects on human behavior according to this paradigm is unproved, and not particularly plausible. Many psychologists within the behaviorist movement are quite skeptical about this (cf. fn. 23). As in the case of most aspects of human behavior, the evidence about secondary reinforce- ment is so fragmentary, conflicting, and complex that almost any view can find some sup- port.
￼30 LANGUAGE, VOLUME 35, NUMBER 1 (1959)
these studies that Skinner has in mind when he refers to the recent advances in the study of animal behavior.4
The notions 'stimulus', 'response', 'reinforcement' are relatively well defined with respect to the bar-pressing experiments and others similarly restricted. Before we can extend them to real-life behavior, however, certain difficulties must be faced. We must decide, first of all, whether any physical event to which the organism is capable of reacting is to be called a stimulus on a given occasion, or only one to which the organism in fact reacts; and correspondingly, we must decide whether any part of behavior is to be called a response, or only one con- nected with stimuli in lawful ways. Questions of this sort pose something of a dilemma for the experimental psychologist. If he accepts the broad definitions, characterizing any physical event impinging on the organism as a stimulus and any part of the organism's behavior as a response, he must conclude that be- havior has not been demonstrated to be lawful. In the present state of our knowledge, we must attribute an overwhelming influence on actual behavior to ill-defined factors of attention, set, volition, and caprice. If we accept the nar- rower definitions, then behavior is lawful by definition (if it consists of responses); but this fact is of limited significance, since most of what the animal does will simply not be considered behavior. Hence the psychologist either must admit that behavior is not lawful (or that he cannot at present show that it is-not at all a damaging admission for a developing science), or must restrict his atten- tion to those highly limited areas in which it is lawful (e.g. with adequate con- trols, bar-pressing in rats; lawfulness of the observed behavior provides, for Skinner, an implicit definition of a good experiment).
Skinner does not consistently adopt either course. He utilizes the experimental results as evidence for the scientific character of his system of behavior, and analogic guesses (formulated in terms of a metaphoric extension of the technical vocabulary of the laboratory) as evidence for its scope. This creates the illusion of a rigorous scientific theory with a very broad scope, although in fact the terms used in the description of real-life and of laboratory behavior may be mere homonyms, with at most a vague similarity of meaning. To substantiate this
4 Skinner's remark quoted above about the generality of his basic results must be under- stood in the light of the experimental limitations he has imposed. If it were true in any deep sense that the basic processes in language are well understood and free of species restric- tions, it would be extremely odd that language is limited to man. With the exception of a few scattered observations (cf. his article, A case history in scientific method, The American psychologist 11.221-33[1956]),Skinneris apparently basing this claim on the fact that quali- tatively similarresultsareobtainedwithbar-pressingofratsandpeckingofpigeonsunder special conditions of deprivation and various schedules of reinforcement. One immediately questions how much can be based on these facts, which are in part at least an artifact trace- able to experimental design and the definition of 'stimulus' and 'response' in terms of 'smooth dynamic curves' (see below). The dangers inherent in any attempt to 'extrapolate' to complex behavior from the study of such simple responses as bar-pressing should be ob- vious, and have often been commented on (cf. e.g. Harlow, op.cit.). The generality of even the simplest results is open to serious question. Cf. in this connection Bitterman, Wodinsky, and Candland, Some comparative psychology, Am. jour. of psych. 71.94-110 (1958), where it is shown that there are important qualitative differences in solution of comparable ele-
mentary problems by rats and fish.

evaluation, a critical account of his book must show that with a literal reading (where the terms of the descriptive system have something like the technical meanings given in Skinner's definitions) the book covers almost no aspect of linguistic behavior, and that with a metaphoric reading, it is no more scientific than the traditional approaches to this subject matter, and rarely as clear and
careful.6
3. Consider first Skinner's use of the notions 'stimulus' and 'response'. In Behavior of organisms (9) he commits himself to the narrow definitions for these terms. A part of the environment and a part of behavior are called stimulus (eliciting, discriminated, or reinforcing) and response, respectively, only if they are lawfully related; that is, if the 'dynamic laws' relating them show smooth and reproducible curves. Evidently stimuli and responses, so defined, have not been shown to figure very widely in ordinary human behavior.6 We can, in the face of presently available evidence, continue to maintain the lawfulness of the relation between stimulus and response only by depriving them of their objective character. A typical example of 'stimulus control' for Skinner would be the response to a piece of music with the utterance Mozart or to a painting with the response Dutch. These responses are asserted to be 'under the control of extremely subtle properties' of the physical object or event (108). Suppose instead of saying Dutch we had said Clashes with the wallpaper, I thoughtyou liked abstractwork, Never saw it before, Tilted, Hanging too low, Beautiful, Hideous, Rememberour camping trip last summer?,or whatever else might come into our minds when looking at a picture (in Skinnerian translation, whatever other responses exist in sufficient strength). Skinner could only say that each of these responses is under the control of some other stimulus property of the physical object. If we look at a red chair and say red, the response is under the control of the stimulus 'redness'; if we say chair, it is under the control of the collection of properties (for Skinner, the object) 'chairness' (110), and similarly for any other response. This device is as simple as it is empty. Since properties are free for the asking
5 An analogous argument, in connection with a different aspect of Skinner's thinking, is givenbyScriveninAstudyofradicalbehaviorism= Univ.ofMinn.studiesinphilosophyof science, Vol. 1. Cf. Verplanck's contribution to Modernlearning theory (283-8) for more general discussion of the difficulties in formulating an adequate definition of 'stimulus' and 'response'. He concludes, quite correctly, that in Skinner's sense of the word, stimuli are not objectively identifiable independently of the resulting behavior, nor are they manipu- lable.VerplanckpresentsacleardiscussionofmanyotheraspectsofSkinner'ssystem, com- menting on the untestability of many of the so-called 'laws of behavior' and the limited scope of many of the others, and the arbitrary and obscure character of Skinner's notion of 'lawful relation'; and, at the same time, noting the importance of the experimental data that Skinner has accumulated.
6 In Behavior of organisms, Skinner apparently was willing to accept this consequence. He insists (41-2) that the terms of casual description in the popular vocabulary are not validly descriptive until the defining properties of stimulus and response are specified, the correlation is demonstrated experimentally, and the dynamic changes in it are shown to be lawful. Thus, in describing a child as hiding from a dog, 'it will not be enough to dig- nify the popular vocabulary by appealing to essential properties of "dogness" or "hiding- ness" and to suppose them intuitively known.' But this is exactly what Skinner does in the book under review, as we will see directly.
￼32 LANGUAGE, VOLUME 35, NUMBER 1 (1959)
(we have as many of them as we have nonsynonymous descriptive expressions in our language, whatever this means exactly), we can account for a wide class of responses in terms of Skinnerian functional analysis by identifying the 'con- trolling stimuli'. But the word 'stimulus' has lost all objectivity in this usage. Stimuli are no longer part of the outside physical world; they are driven back into the organism. We identify the stimulus when we hear the response. It is clear from such examples, which abound, that the talk of 'stimulus control' simply disguises a complete retreat to mentalistic psychology. We cannot pre- dict verbal behavior in terms of the stimuli in the speaker's environment, since we do not know what the current stimuli are until he responds. Furthermore, since we cannot control the property of a physical object to which an individual will respond, except in highly artificial cases, Skinner's claim that his system, as opposed to the traditional one, permits the practical control of verbal be- havior7is quite false.
Other examples of 'stimulus control' merely add to the general mystification. Thus a proper noun is held to be a response 'under the control of a specific person or thing' (as controlling stimulus, 113). I have often used the words Eisenhower and Moscow, which I presume are proper nouns if anything is, but have never been 'stimulated' by the corresponding objects. How can this fact be made compatible with this definition? Suppose that I use the name of a friend who is not present. Is this an instance of a proper noun under the control of the friend as stimulus? Elsewhere it is asserted that a stimulus controls a response in the sense that presence of the stimulus increases the probability of the re- sponse. But it is obviously untrue that the probability that a speaker will pro- duce a full name is increased when its bearer faces the speaker. Furthermore,
7 253 f. and elsewhere, repeatedly. As an example of how well we can control behavior using the notions developed in this book, Skinner shows here how he would go about evok- ing the response pencil. The most effective way, he suggests, is to say to the subject 'Please say pencil' (our chances would, presumably, be even further improved by use of 'aversive stimulation', e.g.holdingaguntohishead).Wecanalso'makesurethatnopencilorwriting instrument is available, then hand our subject a pad of paper appropriate to pencil sketch- ing, and offer him a handsome reward for a recognizable picture of a cat.' It would also be useful to have voices saying pencil or pen and ... in the background; signs reading pencil or pen and ... ; or to place a 'large and unusual pencil in an unusual place clearly in sight'. 'Under such circumstances, it is highly probable that our subject will say pencil.' 'The available techniques are all illustrated in this sample.' These contributions of behav- ior theory to the practical control of human behavior are amply illustrated elsewhere in the book, as when Skinner shows (113-4) how we can evoke the response red (the device suggested is to hold a red object before the subject and say 'Tell me what color this is').
In fairness, it must be mentioned that there are certain nontrivial applications of 'op- erant conditioning' to the control of human behavior. A wide variety of experiments have shown that the number of plural nouns (for example) produced by a subject will increase if the experimenter says 'right' or 'good' when one is produced (similarly, positive attitudes on a certain issue, stories with particular content, etc.; cf. Krasner, Studies of the condi- tioning of verbal behavior, Psych. bull., Vol. 55 [1958],for a survey of several dozen experi- ments of this kind, mostly with positive results). It is of some interest that the subject is usually unaware of the process. Just what insight this gives into normal verbal behavior is not obvious. Nevertheless, it is an example of positive and not totally expected results us- ing the Skinnerian paradigm.
￼REVIEWS 33
how can one's own name be a proper noun in this sense? A multitude of similar questions arise immediately. It appears that the word 'control' here is merely a misleading paraphrase for the traditional 'denote' or 'refer'. The assertion (115) that so far as the speaker is concerned, the relation of reference is 'simply the probability that the speaker will emit a response of a given form in the presence of a stimulus having specified properties' is surely incorrect if we take the words 'presence', 'stimulus', and 'probability' in their literal sense. That they are not intended to be taken literally is indicated by many examples, as when a response is said to be 'controlled' by a situation or state of affairs as 'stimulus'. Thus, the expression a needle in a haystack 'may be controlled as a unit by a particular type of situation' (116); the words in a single part of speech, e.g. all adjectives, are under the control of a single set of subtle properties of stimuli (121); 'the sentence The boy runs a storeis under the control of an extremely complex stim- ulus situation' (335); 'He is not at all well may function as a standard response under the control of a state of affairs which might also control He is ailing' (325); when an envoy observes events in a foreign country and reports upon his return, his report is under 'remote stimulus control' (416); the statement This is war may be a response to a 'confusing international situation' (441); the suffix -ed is controlled by that 'subtle property of stimuli which we speak of as action-in-the-past' (121) just as the -s in The boy runs is under the control of such specific features of the situation as its 'currency' (332). No characterization of the notion 'stimulus control' that is remotely related to the bar-pressing ex- periment (or that preserves the faintest objectivity) can be made to cover a set of examples like these, in which, for example, the 'controlling stimulus' need not even impinge on the responding organism.
Consider now Skinner's use of the notion 'response'. The problem of identi- fying units in verbal behavior has of course been a primary concern of linguists, and it seems very likely that experimental psychologists should be able to pro- vide much-needed assistance in clearing up the many remaining difficulties in systematic identification. Skinner recognizes (20) the fundamental character of the problem of identification of a unit of verbal behavior, but is satisfied with an answer so vague and subjective that it does not really contribute to its solu- tion. The unit of verbal behavior-the verbal operant-is defined as a class of responses of identifiable form functionally related to one or more controlling variables. No method is suggested for determining in a particular instance what are the controlling variables, how many such units have occurred, or where their boundaries are in the total response. Nor is any attempt made to specify how much or what kind of similarity in form or 'control' is required for two physical events to be considered instances of the same operant. In short, no answers are suggested for the most elementary questions that must be asked of anyone pro- posing a method for description of behavior. Skinner is content with what he calls an 'extrapolation' of the concept of operant developed in the laboratory to the verbal field. In the typical Skinnerian experiment, the problem of identify- ing the unit of behavior is not too crucial. It is defined, by fiat, as a recorded peck or bar-press, and systematic variations in the rate of this operant and its
￼34 LANGUAGE, VOLUME 35, NUMBER 1 (1959)
resistance to extinction are studied as a function of deprivation and scheduling of reinforcement (pellets). The operant is thus defined with respect to a particu- lar experimental procedure. This is perfectly reasonable, and has led to many interesting results. It is, however, completely meaningless to speak of extrapo- lating this concept of operant to ordinary verbal behavior. Such 'extrapolation' leaves us with no way of justifying one or another decision about the units in the 'verbal repertoire'.
Skinner specifies 'response strength' as the basic datum, the basic dependent variable in his functional analysis. In the bar-pressing experiment, response strength is defined in terms of rate of emission during extinction. Skinner has argued8that this is 'the only datum that varies significantly and in the expected direction under conditions which are relevant to the "learning process".' In the book under review, response strength is defined as 'probability of emission' (22). This definition provides a comforting impression of objectivity, which, however, is quickly dispelled when we look into the matter more closely. The term 'proba- bility' has some rather obscure meaning for Skinner in this book.9 We are told, on the one hand, that 'our evidence for the contribution of each variable [to response strength] is based on observation of frequencies alone' (28). At the same time, it appears that frequency is a very misleading measure of strength, since, for example, the frequency of a response may be 'primarily attributable to the frequency of occurrence of controlling variables' (27). It is not clear how the frequency of a response can be attributable to anything BUT the fre- quency of occurrence of its controlling variables if we accept Skinner's view
that the behavior occurring in a given situation is 'fully determined' by the
relevant controlling variables (175, 228). Furthermore, although the evidence for the contribution of each variable to response strength is based on observation of frequencies alone, it turns out that 'we base the notion of strength upon several kinds of evidence' (22), in particular (22-8): emission of the response (particularly in unusual circumstances), energy level (stress), pitch level, speed and delay of emission, size of letters etc. in writing, immediate repetition, and-
a final factor, relevant but misleading-over-all frequency.
Of course, Skinner recognizes that these measures do not co-vary, because

9And elsewhere. In his paper Are theories of learning necessary?, Skinner considers the
problem how to extend his analysis of behavior to experimental situations in which it is
impossible to observe frequencies, rate of response being the only valid datum. His answer is that 'the notion of probability is usually extrapolated to cases in which a frequency analysis cannot be carried out. In the field of behavior we arrange a situation in which frequencies are available as data, but we use the notion of probability in analyzing or for- mulating instances of even types of behavior which are not susceptible to this analysis' (199). There are, of course, conceptions of probability not based directly on frequency, but I do not see how any of these apply to the cases that Skinner has in mind. I see no way of interpreting the quoted passage other than as signifying an intention to use the word
'probability' in describing behavior quite independently of whether the notion of proba- bility is at all relevant.

ternal linguistic functions.'0 However, he does not hold these conflicts to be very important, since the proposed factors indicative of strength are 'fully understood by everyone' in the culture (27). For example, 'if we are shown a prized work of art and exclaim Beautiful!, the speed and energy of the response will not be lost on the owner.' It does not appear totally obvious that in this case the way to impress the owner is to shriek Beautiful in a loud, high-pitched voice, repeatedly, and with no delay (high response strength). It may be equally effective to look at the picture silently (long delay), and then to murmur Beau- tiful in a soft, low-pitched voice (by definition, very low response strength).
It is not unfair, I believe, to conclude from Skinner's discussion of response strength, the 'basic datum' in functional analysis, that his 'extrapolation' of the notion of probability can best be interpreted as, in effect, nothing more than a decision to use the word 'probability', with its favorable connotations of ob- jectivity, as a cover term to paraphrase such low-status words as 'interest', 'intention', 'belief', and the like. This interpretation is fully justified by the way in which Skinner uses the terms 'probability' and 'strength'. To cite just one example, Skinner defines the process of confirming an assertion in science as one of 'generating additional variables to increase its probability' (425), and more generally, its strength (425-9). If we take this suggestion quite literally, the degree of confirmation of a scientific assertion can be measured as a simple function of the loudness, pitch, and frequency with which it is proclaimed, and a general procedure for increasing its degree of confirmation would be, for in- stance, to train machine guns on large crowds of people who have been instructed to shout it. A better indication of what Skinner probably has in mind here is given by his description of how the theory of evolution, as an example, is con- firmed. This 'single set of verbal responses ... is made more plausible- is strengthened-by several types of construction based upon verbal responses in geology, paleontology, genetics, and so on' (427). We are no doubt to inter- pret the terms 'strength' and 'probability' in this context as paraphrases of more familiar locutions such as 'justified belief' or 'warranted assertability', or something of the sort. Similar latitude of interpretation is presumably expected
when we read that 'frequency of effective action accounts in turn for what we may call the listener's "belief" ' (88) or that 'our belief in what someone tells us is similarly a function of, or identical with, our tendency to act upon the verbal stimuli which he provides' (160)."
10Fortunately, 'In English this presents no great difficulty' since, for example, 'relative pitch levels ... are not ... important' (25). No reference is made to the numerous studies of the function of relative pitch levels and other intonational features in English.
11The vagueness of the word 'tendency', as opposed to 'frequency', saves the latter quotationfromtheobviousincorrectnessoftheformer.Nevertheless, agooddealofstretch- ing is necessary. If 'tendency' has anything like its ordinarymeaning, the remarkis clearly false. One may believe strongly the assertion that Jupiter has four moons, that many of Sophocles' plays have been irretrievably lost, that the earth will burn to a crisp in ten million years, etc., without experiencing the slightest tendency to act upon these verbal stimuli. We may, of course, turn Skinner's assertion into a very unilluminating truth by defining 'tendency to act' to include tendencies to answer questions in certain ways, under motivation to say what one believes is true.

I think it is evident, then, that Skinner's use of the terms 'stimulus', 'control', 'response', and 'strength' justify the general conclusion stated in the last para- graph of ?2 above. The way in which these terms are brought to bear on the actual data indicates that we must interpret them as mere paraphrases for the popular vocabulary commonly used to describe behavior, and as having no particular connection with the homonymous expressions used in the description of laboratory experiments. Naturally, this terminological revision adds no ob- jectivity to the familiar 'mentalistic' mode of description.
4. The other fundamental notion borrowed from the description of bar- pressing experiments is 'reinforcement'. It raises problems which are similar, and even more serious. In Behavior of organisms, 'the operation of reinforcement is defined as the presentation of a certain kind of stimulus in a temporal relation with either a stimulus or response. A reinforcing stimulus is defined as such by its power to produce the resulting change [in strength]. There is no circularity about this: some stimuli are found to produce the change, others not, and they are classified as reinforcing and non-reinforcing accordingly' (62). This is a per- fectly appropriate definitionl2for the study of schedules of reinforcement. It is perfectly useless, however, in the discussion of real-life behavior, unless we can somehow characterize the stimuli which are reinforcing (and the situations and conditions under which they are reinforcing). Consider first of all the status of the basic principle that Skinner calls the 'law of conditioning' (law of effect). It reads: 'if the occurrence of an operant is followed by presence of a reinforcing stimulus, the strength is increased' (Behavior of organisms 21). As 'reinforce- ment' was defined, this law becomes a tautology.13 For Skinner, learning is just change in response strength.'4 Although the statement that presence of reinforce- ment is a sufficient condition for learning and maintenance of behavior is vacu- ous, the claim that it is a necessary condition may have some content, depending on how the class of reinforcers (and appropriate situations) is characterized. Skinner does make it very clear that in his view reinforcement is a necessary condition for language learning and for the continued availability of linguistic responses in the adult.15However, the looseness of the term 'reinforcement' as
12 Oneshouldadd,however,thatitisingeneralnotthestimulusassuchthatisreinforc- ing, but the stimulus in a particular situational context. Depending on experimental ar- rangement, a particular physical event or object may be reinforcing, punishing, or un- noticed. Because Skinner limits himself to a particular, very simple experimental arrangement, it is not necessary for him to add this qualification, which would not be at all easy to formulate precisely. But it is of course necessary if he expects to extend his descriptive system to behavior in general.
13This has been frequently noted.
14 See, for example, Are theories of learning necessary? 199. Elsewhere, he suggests that the term 'learning' be restricted to complex situations, but these are not characterized.
16 'A child acquires verbal behavior when relatively unpatterned vocalizations, selec- tively reinforced, gradually assume forms which produce appropriate consequences in a given verbal community' (31). 'Differential reinforcement shapes up all verbal forms, and when a prior stimulus enters into the contingency, reinforcement is responsible for its resulting control ... The availability of behavior, its probability or strength, depends on whether reinforcements continue in effect and according to what schedules' (203-4). Else- where, frequently.

Skinner uses it in the book under review makes it entirely pointless to inquire into the truth or falsity of this claim. Examining the instances of what Skinner calls 'reinforcement', we find that not even the requirement that a reinforcer be an identifiable stimulus is taken seriously. In fact, the term is used in such a way that the assertion that reinforcement is necessary for learning and contin- ued availability of behavior is likewise empty.
To show this, we consider some example of 'reinforcement'. First of all, we find a heavy appeal to automatic self-reinforcement. Thus, 'a man talks to himself ... because of the reinforcement he receives' (163); 'the child is reinforced automatically when he duplicates the sounds of airplanes, streetcars ...' (164);
'the young child alone in the nursery may automatically reinforce his own ex- ploratory verbal behavior when he produces sounds which he has heard in the speech of others' (58); 'the speaker who is also an accomplished listener "knows when he has correctly echoed a response" and is reinforced thereby' (68); think- ing is 'behaving which automatically affects the behaver and is reinforcing be- cause it does so' (438; cutting one's finger should thus be reinforcing, and an example of thinking); 'the verbal fantasy, whether overt or covert, is automati- cally reinforcing to the speaker as listener. Just as the musician plays or composes what he is reinforced by hearing, or as the artist paints what reinforces him visually, so the speaker engaged in verbal fantasy says what he is reinforced by hearing or writes what he is reinforced by reading' (439); similarly, care in problem solving, and rationalization, are automatically self-reinforcing (442-3). We can also reinforce someone by emitting verbal behavior as such (since this rules out a class of aversive stimulations, 167), by not emitting verbal behavior (keeping silent and paying attention, 199), or by acting appropriately on some future occasion (152: 'the strength of [the speaker's] behavior is determined mainly by the behavior which the listener will exhibit with respect to a given state of affairs'; this Skinner considers the general case of 'communication' or 'letting the listener know'). In most such cases, of course, the speaker is not present at the time when the reinforcement takes place, as when 'the artist... is reinforced by the effects his works have upon ... others' (224), or when the writer is reinforced by the fact that his 'verbal behavior may reach over cen- turies or to thousands of listeners or readers at the same time. The writer may not be reinforced often or immediately, but his net reinforcement may be great' (206; this accounts for the great 'strength' of his behavior). An individual may also find it reinforcing to injure someone by criticism or by bringing bad news, or to publish an experimental result which upsets the theory of a rival (154), to describe circumstances which would be reinforcing if they were to occur (165), to avoid repetition (222), to 'hear' his own name though in fact it was not men- tioned or to hear nonexistent words in his child's babbling (259), to clarify or otherwise intensify the effect of a stimulus which serves an important discrim- inative function (416), etc.
From this sample, it can be seen that the notion of reinforcement has totally lost whatever objective meaning it may ever have had. Running through these examples, we see that a person can be reinforced though he emits no response at all, and that the reinforcing 'stimulus' need not impinge on the 'reinforcedperson'
￼38 LANGUAGE, VOLUME 35, NUMBER 1 (1959)
or need not even exist (it is sufficient that it be imagined or hoped for). When we read that a person plays what music he likes (165), says what he likes (165), thinks what he likes (438-9), reads what books he likes (163), etc., BECAUSE he finds it reinforcing to do so, or that we write books or inform others of facts BECAUSE we are reinforced by what we hope will be the ultimate behavior of reader or listener, we can only conclude that the term 'reinforcement' has a purely ritual function. The phrase 'X is reinforced by Y (stimulus, state of af- fairs, event, etc.)' is being used as a cover term for 'X wants Y', 'X likes Y', 'X wishes that Y were the case', etc. Invoking the term 'reinforcement' has no ex- planatory force, and any idea that this paraphrase introduces any new clarity or objectivity into the description of wishing, liking, etc., is a serious delusion. The only effect is to obscure the important differences among the notions being paraphrased. Once we recognize the latitude with which the term 'reinforcement' is being used, many rather startling comments lose their initial effect-for in- stance, that the behavior of the creative artist is 'controlled entirely by the contingencies of reinforcement' (150). What has been hoped for from the psy- chologist is some indication how the casual and informal description of everyday behavior in the popular vocabulary can be explained or clarified in terms of the notions developed in careful experiment and observation, or perhaps replaced in terms of a better scheme. A mere terminological revision, in which a term borrowed from the laboratory is used with the full vagueness of the ordinary vocabulary, is of no conceivable interest.
It seems that Skinner's claim that all verbal behavior is acquired and main- tained in 'strength' through reinforcement is quite empty, because his notion of reinforcement has no clear content, functioning only as a cover term for any factor, detectable or not, related to acquisition or maintenance of verbal beha- vior.'6 Skinner's use of the term 'conditioning' suffers from a similar difficulty. Pavlovian and operant conditioning are processes about which psychologists have developed real understanding. Instruction of human beings is not. The claim that instruction and imparting of information are simply matters of condi- tioning (357-66) is pointless. The claim is true, if we extend the term 'condition- ing' to cover these processes, but we know no more about them after having revised this term in such a way as to deprive it of its relatively clear and ob- jective character. It is, as far as we know, quite false, if we use 'conditioning' in its literal sense. Similarly, when we say that 'it is the function of predication to facilitate the transfer of response from one term to another or from one object to another' (361), we have said nothing of any significance. In what sense is this true of the predication Whales are mammals?Or, to take Skinner's example, what point is there in saying that the effect of The telephoneis out of orderon the listener is to bring behavior formerly controlled by the stimulus out of order under control of the stimulus telephone(or the telephone itself) by a process of simple conditioning (362)? What laws of conditioning hold in this case? Further-
1* Talk of schedules of reinforcement here is entirely pointless. How are we to decide, for example, according to what schedules covert reinforcement is 'arranged', as in thinking or verbal fantasy, or what the scheduling is of such factors as silence, speech, and ap- propriate future reactions to communicated information?

more, what behavior is 'controlled' by the stimulus out of order,in the abstract? Depending on the object of which this is predicated, the present state of motiva- tion of the listener, etc., the behavior may vary from rage to pleasure, from fixing the object to throwing it out, from simply not using it to trying to use it in the normal way (e.g. to see if it is really out of order), and so on. To speak of 'con- ditioning' or 'bringing previously available behavior under control of a new stimulus' in such a case is just a kind of play-acting at science. Cf. also foot- note 43.
5. The claim that careful arrangement of contingencies of reinforcement by the verbal community is a necessary condition for language learning has ap- peared, in one form or another, in many places.'7Since it is based not on actual observation, but on analogies to laboratory study of lower organisms, it is im- portant to determine the status of the underlying assertion within experimental psychology proper. The most common characterization of reinforcement (one which Skinner explicitly rejects, incidentally) is in terms of drive reduction. This characterization can be given substance by defining drives in some way inde- pendently of what in fact is learned. If a drive is postulated on the basis of the fact that learning takes place, the claim that reinforcement is necessary for learning will again become as empty as it is in the Skinnerian framework. There is an extensive literature on the question of whether there can be learning with- out drive-reduction (latent learning). The 'classical' experiment of Blodgett indicated that rats who had explored a maze without reward showed a marked drop in number of errors (as compared to a control group which had not ex- plored the maze) upon introduction of a food reward, indicating that the rat had learned the structure of the maze without reduction of the hunger drive. Drive-reduction theorists countered with an exploratory drive which was re- duced during the prereward learning, and claimed that a slight decrement in errors could be noted before food reward. A wide variety of experiments, with somewhat conflicting results, have been carried out with a similar design.18 Few investigators still doubt the existence of the phenomenon. Hilgard, in his general review of learning theory,'9 concludes that 'there is no longer any doubt but that, under appropriate circumstances, latent learning is demonstrable.'
More recent work has shown that novelty and variety of stimulus are sufficient
17 See, for example, Miller and Dollard, Social learning and imitation 82-3 (New York, 1941), for a discussion of the 'meticulous training' that they seem to consider necessary for a child to learn the meanings of words and syntactic patterns. The same notion is implicit in Mowrer's speculative account of how language might be acquired, in Learningtheoryand personality dynamics, Chapter 23 (New York, 1950). Actually, the view appears to be quite general.
18 For a general review and analysis of this literature, see Thistlethwaite, A critical review of latent learning and related experiments, Psych. bull. 48.97-129 (1951). MacCor- quodale and Meehl, in their contribution to Modernlearning theory,carry out a serious and considered attempt to handle the latent learning material from the standpoint of drive- reduction theory, with (as they point out) not entirely satisfactory results. Thorpe reviews the literature from the standpoint of the ethologist, adding also material on homing and topographical orientation (Learning and instinct in animals [Cambridge, 1956]).

to arouse curiosity in the rat and to motivate it to explore (visually), and in fact, to learn (since on a presentation of two stimuli, one novel, one repeated, the rat will attend to the novel one);20that rats will learn to choose the arm of a single-choice maze that leads to a complex maze, running through this being their only 'reward';21that monkeys can learn object discriminations and maintain their performance at a high level of efficiency with visual exploration (looking out of a window for 30 seconds) as the only reward;22and, perhaps most strikingly of all, that monkeys and apes will solve rather complex manipulation problems that are simply placed in their cages, and will solve discrimination problems with only exploration and manipulation as incentives.23In these cases, solving the problem is apparently its own 'reward'. Results of this kind can be handled by reinforcement theorists only if they are willing to set up curiosity, exploration, and manipulation drives, or to speculate somehow about acquired drives24for which there is no evidence outside of the fact that learning takes place in these cases.

Harlow has been particularly insistent on maintaining the inadequacy of physiologically based drives and homeostatic need states for explaining the persistence of motivation and rapidity of learn- ing in primates. He points out, in many papers, that curiosity, play, exploration, and ma- nipulation are, for primates, often more potent drives than hunger and the like, and that they show none of the characteristics of acquired drives. Hebb also presents behavioral and supporting neurological evidence in support of the view that in higher animals there is a positive attraction in work, risk, puzzle, intellectual activity, mild fear and frustration, etc. (Drives and the CNS, Psych. rev. 62.243-54 [1955]).He concludes that 'we need not work out tortuous and improbableways to explain why men work for money, why children learn without pain, why people dislike doing nothing.'
In a brief note (Early recognition of the manipulative drive in monkeys, British journal of animal behaviour3.71-2 [1955]),W. Dennis calls attention to the fact that early investi- gators (Romanes, 1882; Thorndike, 1901), whose 'perception was relatively unaffected by learning theory, did note the intrinsically motivated behavior of monkeys', although, he asserts, no similar observations on monkeys have been made until Harlow's experiments. He quotes Romanes (Animal intelligence [1882])as saying that 'much the most striking fea- ture in the psychology of this animal, and the one which is least like anything met with in other animals, was the tireless spirit of investigation.' Analogous developments, in which genuine discoveries have blinded systematic investigators to the important insights of earlier work, are easily found within recent structural linguistics as well.
24 ThusJ.S.Brown,incommentingonapaperofHarlow'sinCurrenttheoryandresearch in motivation (Lincoln, 1953), argues that 'in probably every instance [of the experiments cited by Harlow] an ingenious drive-reduction theorist could find some fragment of fear, insecurity, frustration, or whatever, that he could insist was reduced and hence was rein- forcing' (53). The same sort of thing could be said for the ingenious phlogiston or ether theorist.

There is a variety of other kinds of evidence that has been offered to challenge the view that drive-reduction is necessary for learning. Results on sensory- sensory conditioning have been interpreted as demonstrating learning without drive-reduction.25Olds has reported reinforcement by direct stimulation of the brain, from which he concludes that reward need not satisfy a physiological need or withdraw a drive stimulus.26The phenomenon of imprinting, long observed by zoologists, is of particular interest in this connection. Some of the most complex patterns of behavior of birds, in particular, are directed towards objects and animals of the type to which they have been exposed at certain critical early periods of life.27Imprinting is the most striking evidence for the innate disposi- tion of the animal to learn in a certain direction, and to react appropriately to patterns and objects of certain restricted types, often only long after the original learning has taken place. It is, consequently, unrewarded learning, though the resulting patterns of behavior may be refined through reinforcement. Acquisition of the typical songs of song birds is, in some cases, a type of imprinting. Thorpe
reports studies that show 'that some characteristics of the normal song have been learnt in the earliest youth, before the bird itself is able to produce any kind of full song'.28The phenomenon of imprinting has recently been investi- gated under laboratory conditions and controls with positive results.29
Phenomena of this general type are certainly familiar from everyday experi- ence. We recognize people and places to which we have given no particular attention. We can look up something in a book and learn it perfectly well with no other motive than to confute reinforcement theory, or out of boredom, or idle curiosity. Everyone engaged in research must have had the experience of working with feverish and prolonged intensity to write a paper which no one else will read or to solve a problem which no one else thinks important and which will bring no conceivable reward-which may only confirm a general opinion that the researcheris wasting his time on irrelevancies. The fact that rats and monkeys do likewise is interesting, and important to show in careful experiment. In fact, studies of behavior of the type mentioned above have an independent and posi- tive significance that far outweighs their incidental importance in bringing into question the claim that learning is impossible without drive-reduction. It is not at all unlikely that insights arising from animal behavior studies with this broadened scope may have the kind of relevance to such complex activities as
verbal behavior that reinforcement theory has, so far, failed to exhibit. In any event, in the light of presently available evidence, it is difficult to see how anyone

can be willing to claim that reinforcement is necessary for learning, if reinforce- ment is taken seriously as something identifiable independently of the resulting change in behavior.
Similarly, it seems quite beyond question that children acquire a good deal of their verbal and nonverbal behavior by casual observation and imitation of adults and other children.30It is simply not true that children can learn language only through 'meticulous care' on the part of adults who shape their verbal repertoire through careful differential reinforcement, though it may be that such care is often the custom in academic families. It is a common observation that a young child of immigrant parents may learn a second language in the streets, from other children, with amazing rapidity, and that his speech may be com- pletely fluent and correct to the last allophone, while the subtleties that become second nature to the child may elude his parents despite high motivation and continued practice. A child may pick up a large part of his vocabulary and 'feel' for sentence structure from television, from reading, from listening to adults, etc. Even a very young child who has not yet acquired a minimal repertoire from which to form new utterances may imitate a word quite well on an early try, with no attempt on the part of his parents to teach it to him. It is also perfectly obvious that, at a later stage, a child will be able to construct and understand utterances which are quite new, and are, at the same time, acceptable sentences in his language. Every time an adult reads a newspaper, he undoubtedly comes upon countless new sentences which are not at all similar, in a simple, physical sense, to any that he has heard before, and which he will recognize as sentences and understand; he will also be able to detect slight distortions or misprints. Talk of 'stimulus generalization' in such a case simply perpetuates the mystery
under a new title. These abilities indicate that there must be fundamental processes at work quite independently of 'feedback' from the environment. I have been able to find no support whatsoever for the doctrine of Skinner and others that slow and careful shaping of verbal behavior through differential re- inforcement is an absolute necessity. If reinforcement theory really requires the
30Of course it is perfectly possible to incorporate this fact within the Skinnerian frame' work. If, for example, a child watches an adult using a comb and then, with no instruction' tries to comb his own hair, we can explain this act by saying that he performs it because he finds it reinforcing to do so, or because of the reinforcement provided by behaving like a person who is 'reinforcing' (cf. 164). Similarly, an automatic explanation is available for any other behavior. It seems strange at first that Skinner pays so little attention to the literature on latent learning and related topics, considering the tremendous reliance that he places on the notion of reinforcement; I have seen no reference to it in his writings. Similarly, Keller and Schoenfeld, in what appears to be the only text written under pre- dominantly Skinnerian influence, Principles of psychology (New York, 1950), dismiss the latent-learning literature in one sentence as 'beside the point', serving only 'to obscure, rather than clarify, a fundamental principle' (the law of effect, 41). However, this neglect is perfectly appropriate in Skinner's case. To the drive-reductionist, or anyone else for whom the notion 'reinforcement' has some substantive meaning, these experiments and observations are important (and often embarrassing). But in the Skinnerian sense of the word, neither these results nor any conceivable others can cast any doubt on the claim that reinforcement is essential for the acquisition and maintenance of behavior. Behavior cer-
tainly has some concomitant circumstances, and whatever they are, we can call them 'reinforcement'.

assumption that there be such meticulous care, it seems best to regard this simply as a reductio ad absurdum argument against this approach. It is also not easy to find any basis (or, for that matter, to attach very much content) to the claim that reinforcing contingencies set up by the verbal community are the single factor responsible for maintaining the strength of verbal behavior. The sources of the 'strength' of this behavior are almost a total mystery at present. Reinforcement undoubtedly plays a significant role, but so do a variety of moti- vational factors about which nothing serious is known in the case of human beings.
As far as acquisition of language is concerned, it seems clear that reinforcement, casual observation, and natural inquisitiveness (coupled with a strong tendency to imitate) are important factors, as is the remarkable capacity of the child to generalize, hypothesize, and 'process information' in a variety of very special and apparently highly complex ways which we cannot yet describe or begin to under- stand, and which may be largely innate, or may develop through some sort of learning or through maturation of the nervous system. The manner in which such factors operate and interact in language acquisition is completely unknown. It is clear that what is necessary in such a case is research, not dogmatic and per- fectly arbitrary claims, based on analogies to that small part of the experimental literature in which one happens to be interested.
The pointlessness of these claims becomes clear when we consider the well- known difficulties in determining to what extent inborn structure, maturation, and learning are responsible for the particular form of a skilled or complex per- formance.3'To take just one example,32the gaping response of a nestling thrush is at first released by jarring of the nest, and, at a later stage, by a moving object of specific size, shape, and position relative to the nestling. At this later stage the response is directed towards the part of the stimulus object corresponding to the parent's head, and characterized by a complex configuration of stimuli that can be precisely described. Knowing just this, it would be possible to con- struct a speculative, learning-theoretic account of how this sequence of behavior patterns might have developed through a process of differential reinforcement, and it would no doubt be possible to train rats to do something similar. However, there appears to be good evidence that these responses to fairly complex 'sign stimuli' are genetically determined and mature without learning. Clearly, the possibility cannot be discounted. Consider now the comparable case of a child imitating new words. At an early stage we may find rather gross correspond- ences. At a later stage, we find that repetition is of course far from exact (i.e.

it is not mimicry, a fact which itself is interesting), but that it reproduces the highly complex configuration of sound features that constitute the phonological structure of the language in question. Again, we can propose a speculative ac- count of how this result might have been obtained through elaborate arrange- ment of reinforcing contingencies. Here too, however, it is possible that ability to select out of the complex auditory input those features that are phonologically relevant may develop largely independently of reinforcement, through geneti- cally determined maturation. To the extent that this is true, an account of the development and causation of behavior that fails to consider the structure of the organism will provide no understanding of the real processes involved.

formation in certain specific ways, must be the factor of overwhelming dom-
inance in determining the specific character of language acquisition, since a
child speaks the language of the group in which he lives. But this is a superficial
argument. As long as we are speculating, we may consider the possibility that
the brain has evolved to the point where, given an input of observed Chinese
sentences, it produces (by an 'induction' of apparently fantastic complexity and
suddenness) the 'rules' of Chinese grammar, and given an input of observed
English sentences, it produces (by, perhaps, exactly the same process of induc-
tion) the rules of English grammar; or that given an observed application of a term to certain instances it automatically predicts the extension to a class of
complexly related instances. If clearly recognized as such, this speculation is neither unreasonable nor fantastic; nor, for that matter, is it beyond the bounds of possible study. There is of course no known neural structure capable of per- forming this task in the specific ways that observation of the resulting behavior might lead us to postulate; but for that matter, the structures capable of ac- counting for even the simplest kinds of learning have similarly defied detection.38
Summarizing this brief discussion, it seems that there is neither empirical evidence nor any known argument to support any SPECIFIC claim about the relative importance of 'feedback' from the environment and the 'independent contribution of the organism' in the process of language acquisition.
6. We now turn to the system that Skinner develops specifically for the de- scription of verbal behavior. Since this system is based on the notions 'stimulus', 'response', and 'reinforcement', we can conclude from the preceding sections that it will be vague and arbitrary. For reasons noted in ?1, however, I think it is important to see in detail how far from the mark any analysis phrased solely in these terms must be and how completely this system fails to account for the facts of verbal behavior.
Consider first the term 'verbal behavior' itself. This is defined as 'behavior
33Cf. Lashley, In search of the engram, Symposium of the Society for Experimental Biology 4.454-82 (1950). Sperry, On the neural basis of the conditioned response, British journal of animal behaviour3.41-4 (1955),argues that to account for the experimental results
of Lashley and others, and for other facts that he cites, it is necessary to assume that
high-level cerebralactivity of the type of insight, expectancy, etc. is involved even in simple
conditioning. He states that 'we still lack today a satisfactory picture of the underlying neural mechanism' of the conditioned response.

reinforced through the mediation of other persons' (2). The definition is clearly much too broad. It would include as 'verbal behavior', for example, a rat pressing the bar in a Skinner-box, a child brushing his teeth, a boxer retreating before an opponent, and a mechanic repairing an automobile. Exactly how much of ordinary linguistic behavior is 'verbal' in this sense, however, is something of a question: perhaps, as I have pointed out above, a fairly small fraction of it, if any substantive meaning is assigned to the term 'reinforced'. This definition is subsequently refined by the additional provision that the mediating response of
the reinforcing person (the 'listener') must itself 'have been conditioned precisely in orderto reinforcethe behavior of the speaker' (225, italics his). This still covers the examples given above, if we can assume that the 'reinforcing' behavior of the psychologist, the parent, the opposing boxer, and the paying customer are the result of appropriate training, which is perhaps not unreasonable. A signifi- cant part of the fragment of linguistic behavior covered by the earlier definition will no doubt be excluded by the refinement, however. Suppose, for example, that while crossing the street I hear someone shout Watch out for the car and jump out of the way. It can hardly be proposed that my jumping (the mediating, reinforcing response in Skinner's usage) was conditioned (that is, I was trained to jump) precisely in order to reinforce the behavior of the speaker. Similarly for a wide class of cases. Skinner's assertion that with this refined definition 'we narrow our subject to what is traditionally recognized as the verbal field' (225) appears to be grossly in error.
7. Verbal operants are classified by Skinner in terms of their 'functional' rela- tion to discriminated stimulus, reinforcement, and other verbal responses. A mand is defined as 'a verbal operant in which the response is reinforced by a
characteristic consequence and is therefore under the functional control of rele- vant conditions of deprivation or aversive stimulation' (35). This is meant to include questions, commands, etc. Each of the terms in this definition raises a host of problems. A mand such as Pass the salt is a class of responses. We cannot tell by observing the form of a response whether it belongs to this class (Skinner is very clear about this), but only by identifying the controlling variables. This is generally impossible. Deprivation is defined in the bar-pressing experiment in terms of length of time that the animal has not been fed or permitted to drink. In the present context, however, it is quite a mysterious notion. No attempt is made here to describe a method for determining 'relevant conditions of depriva- tion' independently of the 'controlled' response. It is of no help at all to be told (32) that it can be characterized in terms of the operations of the experimenter. If we define deprivation in terms of elapsed time, then at any moment a person is in countless states of deprivation.34It appears that we must decide that the relevant condition of deprivation was (say) salt-deprivation, on the basis of the fact that the speaker asked for salt (the reinforcing community which 'sets up'
34Furthermore, the motivation of the speaker does not, except in the simplest cases, correspond in intensity to the duration of deprivation. An obvious counter-example is what Hebb has called the 'salted-nut phenomenon' (Organizationof behavior199 [New York,1949]).Thedifficultyisofcourseevenmoreseriouswhenweconsider'deprivations' not related to physiological drives.
￼46 LANGUAGE, VOLUME 35, NUMBER 1 (1959)
the mand is in a similar predicament). In this case, the assertion that a mand is under the control of relevant deprivation is empty, and we are (contrary to Skinner's intention) identifying the response as a mand completely in terms of form. The word 'relevant' in the definition above conceals some rather serious complications.
In the case of the mand Pass thesalt, the word 'deprivation' is not out of place, though it appears to be of little use for functional analysis. Suppose however that thespeakersaysGivemethebook,Takemeforaride,orLetmefix it.What kinds of deprivation can be associated with these mands? How do we determine or measure the relevant deprivation? I think we must conclude in this case, as before, either that the notion 'deprivation' is relevant at most to a minute frag- ment of verbal behavior, or else that the statement 'X is under Y-deprivation' is just an odd paraphrase for 'X wants Y', bearing a misleading and unjustifiable connotation of objectivity.
The notion 'aversive control' is just as confused. This is intended to cover threats, beating, and the like (33). The manner in which aversive stimulation functions is simply described. If a speaker has had a history of appropriate re- inforcement (e.g. if a certain response was followed by 'cessation of the threat of such injury-of events which have previously been followed by such injury and which are therefore conditioned aversive stimuli') then he will tend to give the proper response when the threat which had previously been followed by the injury is presented. It would appear to follow from this description that a speaker will not respond properly to the mand Your money or your life (38) unless he has a past history of being killed. But even if the difficulties in describing the mechanism of aversive control are somehow removed by a more careful analysis, it will be of little use for identifying operants for reasons similar to those men- tioned in the case of deprivation.
It seems, then, that in Skinner's terms there is in most cases no way to decide whether a given response is an instance of a particular mand. Hence it is meaning- less, within the terms of his system, to speak of the characteristicconsequences of a mand, as in the definition above. Furthermore, even if we extend the system so that mands can somehow be identified, we will have to face the obvious fact that most of us are not fortunate enough to have our requests, commands, advice, and so on characteristically reinforced (they may nevertheless exist in considerable 'strength'). These responses could therefore not be considered mands by Skinner. In fact, Skinner sets up a category of 'magical mands' (48-9) to cover the case of 'mands which cannot be accounted for by showing that they have ever had the effect specified or any similar effect upon similar occasions' (the word 'ever' in this statement should be replaced by 'characteristically'). In these pseudo mands, 'the speaker simply describes the reinforcement appro- priate to a given state of deprivation or aversive stimulation'. In other words, given the meaning that we have been led to assign to 'reinforcement' and 'depri- vation', the speaker asks for what he wants. The remark that 'a speaker appears to create new mands on the analogy of old ones' is also not very helpful.
Skinner's claim that his new descriptive system is superior to the traditional one 'because its terms can be defined with respect to experimental operations'
￼REVIEWS 47
(45) is, we see once again, an illusion. The statement 'X wants Y' is not clarified by pointing out a relation between rate of bar-pressing and hours of food-depri- vation; replacing 'X wants Y' by 'X is deprived of Y' adds no new objectivity to the description of behavior. His further claim for the superiority of the new analysis of mands is that it provides an objective basis for the traditional classi- fication into requests, commands, etc. (38-41). The traditional classification is in terms of the intention of the speaker. But intention, Skinner holds, can be reduced to contingencies of reinforcement, and, correspondingly, we can explain the traditional classification in terms of the reinforcing behavior of the listener. Thus a question is a mand which 'specifies verbal action, and the behavior of the listener permits us to classify it as a request, a command, or a prayer' (39). It is a request if 'the listener is independently motivated to reinforce the speaker'; a command if 'the listener's behavior is ... reinforced by reducing a threat'; a prayer if the mand 'promotes reinforcement by generating an emotional disposi- tion'. The mand is advice if the listener is positively reinforced by the conse- quences of mediating the reinforcement of the speaker; it is a warning if 'by carrying out the behavior specified by the speaker the listener escapes from aversive stimulation'; and so on. All this is obviously wrong if Skinner is using the words 'request', 'command', etc., in anything like the sense of the corre- sponding English words. The word 'question' does not cover commands. Please pass the salt is a request (but not a question), whether or not the listener happens to be motivated to fulfill it; not everyone to whom a request is addressed is favorably disposed. A response does not cease to be a command if it is not fol- lowed; nor does a question become a command if the speaker answers it because of an implied or imagined threat. Not all advice is good advice, and a response does not cease to be advice if it is not followed. Similarly, a warning may be misguided; heeding it may cause aversive stimulation, and ignoring it might be positively reinforcing. In short, the entire classification is beside the point. A moment's thought is sufficient to demonstrate the impossibility of distinguishing between requests, commands, advice, etc., on the basis of the behavior or dis- position of the particular listener. Nor can we do this on the basis of the typical behavior of all listeners. Some advice is never taken, is always bad, etc., and similarly with other kinds of mands. Skinner's evident satisfaction with this analysis of the traditional classification is extremely puzzling.
8. Mands are operants with no specified relation to a prior stimulus. A tact, on the other hand, is defined as 'a verbal operant in which a response of given form is evoked (or at least strengthened) by a particular object or event or property of an object or event' (81). The examples quoted in the discussion of stimulus control (?3) are all tacts. The obscurity of the notion 'stimulus control' makes the concept of the tact rather mystical. Since, however, the tact is 'the most important of verbal operants', it is important to investigate the develop- ment of this concept in more detail.
We first ask why the verbal community 'sets up' tacts in the child-that is, how the parent is reinforced by setting up the tact. The basic explanation for this behavior of the parent (85-6) is the reinforcement he obtains by the fact that his contact with the environment is extended; to use Skinner's example, the
￼48 LANGUAGEV,OLUME35,NUMBER1(1959)
child may later be able to call him to the telephone. (It is difficult to see, then, how first children acquire tacts, since the parent does not have the appropriate history of reinforcement). Reasoning in the same way, we may conclude that the parent induces the child to walk so that he can make some money delivering newspapers. Similarly, the parent sets up an 'echoic repertoire' (e.g. a phonemic system) in the child because this makes it easier to teach him new vocabulary, and extending the child's vocabulary is ultimately useful to the parent. 'In all these cases we explain the behavior of the reinforcing listener by pointing to an improvement in the possibility of controlling the speaker whom he reinforces' (56). Perhaps this provides the explanation for the behavior of the parent in inducing the child to walk: the parent is reinforced by the improvement in his control of the child when the child's mobility increases. Underlying these modes of explanation is a curious view that it is somehow more scientific to attribute to a parent a desire to control the child or enhance his own possibilities for action than a desire to see the child develop and extend his capacities. Needless to say, no evidence is offered to support this contention.
Consider now the problem of explaining the response of the listener to a tact. Suppose, for example, that B hears A say fox and reacts appropriately, looks around, runs away, aims his rifle, etc. How can we explain B's behavior? Skinner rightly rejects analyses of this offered by Watson and Bertrand Russell. His own equally inadequate analysis proceeds as follows (87-8). We assume (1) 'that in the history of [B] the stimulus fox has been an occasion upon which looking around has been followed by seeing a fox' and (2) 'that the listener has some current "interest in seeing foxes"-that behavior which depends upon a seen fox for its execution is strong, and that the stimulus supplied by a fox is therefore reinforcing'. B carries out the appropriate behavior, then, because 'the heard stimulus fox is the occasion upon which turning and looking about is frequently followed by the reinforcement of seeing a fox'; i.e. his behavior is a discriminated operant. This explanation is unconvincing. B may never have seen a fox and may have no current interest in seeing one, and yet may react appropriately to the stimulus fox.35 Since exactly the same behavior may take place when neither of the assumptions is fulfilled, some other mechanism must be operative here.
Skinner remarks several times that his analysis of the tact in terms of stimulus control is an improvement over the traditional formulations in terms of reference and meaning. This is simply not true. His analysis is fundamentally the same as the traditional one, though much less carefully phrased. In particular, it differs only by indiscriminate paraphrase of such notions as denotation (reference) and connotation (meaning), which have been kept clearly apart in traditional formulations, in terms of the vague concept 'stimulus control'. In one tradi- tional formulation a descriptive term is said to denote a set of entities and to connote or designate a certain property or condition that an entity must possess
35Just as he may have the appropriate reaction, both emotional and behavioral, to such utterances as The volcano is erupting or There's a homicidal maniac in the next room without any previous pairing of the verbal and the physical stimulus. Skinner's discussion of Pav- lovian conditioning in language (154) is similarly unconvincing.

or fulfil if the term is to apply to it.36Thus the term vertebraterefers to (denotes, is true of) vertebrates and connotes the property 'having a spine' or something of the sort. This connoted defining property is called the meaning of the term. Two terms may have the same reference but different meanings. Thus it is ap- parently true that the creatures with hearts are all and only the vertebrates. If so, then the term creaturewith a heartrefers to vertebrates and designates the property 'having a heart'. This is presumably a different property (a different general condition) from having a spine; hence the terms vertebrateand creature with a heart are said to have different meanings. This analysis is not incorrect (for at least one sense of meaning), but its many limitations have frequently been pointed out.37The major problem is that there is no good way to decide whether two descriptive terms designate the same property.38As we have just seen, it is not sufficient that they refer to the same objects. Vertebrateand creaturewith a spine would be said to designate the same property (distinct from that designated by creaturewith a heart). If we ask why this is so, the only answer appears to be that the terms are synonymous. The notion 'property' thus seems somehow
36 Mill, A system of logic (1843). Carnap gives a recent reformulation in Meaning and synonymy in natural languages, Phil. studies 6.33-47 (1955), defining the meaning (inten- sion) of a predicate 'Q' for a speaker X as 'the general condition which an object y must fulfill in order for X to be willing to ascribe the predicate "Q" to y'. The connotation of an expression is often said to constitute its 'cognitive meaning' as opposed to its 'emotive meaning', which is, essentially, the emotional reaction to the expression.
Whether or not this is the best way to approach meaning, it is clear that denotation, cognitive meaning,and emotive meaning are quite differentthings. The differencesare often obscured in empirical studies of meaning, with much consequent confusion. Thus Osgood has set himself the task of accounting for the fact that a stimulus comes to be a sign for another stimulus (a buzzer becomes a sign for food, a word for a thing, etc.). This is clearly (for linguistic signs) a problem of denotation. The method that he actually develops for quantifying and measuring meaning (cf. Osgood, Suci, Tannenbaum, The measurementof meaning [Urbana, 19571)applies, however, only to emotive meaning. Suppose, for example, that A hates both Hitler and science intensely, and considers both highly potent and 'active', while B, agreeing with A about Hitler, likes science very much, although he con- siders it rather ineffective and not too important. Then A may assign to 'Hitler' and 'sci- ence' the same position on the semantic differential, while B will assign 'Hitler' the same position as A did, but 'science' a totally different position. Yet A does not think that 'Hit- ler' and 'science' are synonymous or that they have the same reference, and A and B may agree precisely on the cognitive meaning of 'science'. Clearly it is the attitude toward the things (the emotive meaning of the words) that is being measured here. There is a gradual shift in Osgood's account from denotation to cognitive meaning to emotive meaning. The confusion is caused, no doubt, by the fact that the term 'meaning'is used in all three senses (and others). [See Carroll's review of the book by Osgood, Suci, and Tannenbaum in this number of LANGUAGE.]

Carnap (op.cit.) presents a very similar idea (?6), but somewhat misleadingly phrased, since he does not bring out the fact that only extensional (referential) notions are being used.

language-bound, and appeal to 'defining properties' sheds little light on questions of meaning and synonymy.
Skinner accepts the traditional account in toto, as can be seen from his defini- tion of a tact as a response under control of a property (stimulus) of some physi- cal object or event. We have found that the notion 'control' has no real sub- stance, and is perhaps best understood as a paraphrase of 'denote' or 'connote' or, ambiguously, both. The only consequence of adopting the new term 'stimulus control' is that the important differences between reference and meaning are obscured. It provides no new objectivity. The stimulus controlling the response is determined by the response itself; there is no independent and objective method of identification (see ?3 above). Consequently, when Skinner defines 'synonymy' as the case in which 'the same stimulus leads to quite different re- sponses' (118), we can have no objection. The responses chair and red made alternatively to the same object are not synonymous, because the stimuli are called different. The responses vertebrateand creaturewith a spine would be con- sidered synonymous because they are controlled by the same property of the object under investigation; in more traditional and no less scientific terms, they evoke the same concept. Similarly, when metaphorical extension is ex- plained as due to 'the control exercised by properties of the stimulus which, though present at reinforcement, do not enter into the contingency respected by the verbal community' (92; traditionally, accidental properties), no objection can be raised which has not already been levelled against the traditional account. Just as we could 'explain' the response Mozart to a piece of music in terms of subtle properties of the controlling stimuli, we can, with equal facility, explain the appearance of the response sun when no sun is present, as in Juliet is [like] the sun. 'We do so by noting that Juliet and the sun have common properties, at least in their effect on the speaker' (93). Since any two objects have indefinitely many properties in common, we can be certain that we will never be at a loss to explain a response of the form A is like B, for arbitrary A and B. It is clear, however, that Skinner's recurrent claim that his formulation is simpler and more scientific than the traditional account has no basis in fact.
Tacts under the control of private stimuli (Bloomfield's 'displaced speech') form a large and important class (130-46), including not only such responses as familiar and beautiful, but also verbal responses referring to past, potential, or future events or behavior. For example, the response There was an elephant at the zoo 'must be understood as a response to current stimuli, including events within the speaker himself' (143).39 If we now ask ourselves what proportion of
39In general, the examples discussed here are badly handled, and the success of the proposed analyses is overstated. In each case, it is easy to see that the proposed analysis, which usually has an air of objectivity, is not equivalent to the analyzed expression. To take just one example, the response I am looking for my glasses is certainly not equivalent to the proposed paraphrases: 'When I have behaved in this way in the past, I have found my glasses and have then stopped behaving in this way', or 'Circumstances have arisen in which I am inclined to emit any behavior which in the past has led to the discovery of my glasses; such behavior includes the behavior of looking in which I am now engaged.' One may look for one's glasses for the first time; or one may emit the same behavior in

the tacts in actual life are responses to (descriptions of) actual current outside stimulation, we can see just how large a role must be attributed to private stimuli. A minute amount of verbal behavior, outside the nursery, consists of such remarks as This is red and Thereis a man. The fact that 'functional analysis' must make such a heavy appeal to obscure internal stimuli is again a measure of its actual advance over traditional formulations.
9. Responses under the control of prior verbal stimuli are considered under a different heading from the tact. An echoicoperantis a response which 'generates a sound pattern similar to that of the stimulus' (55). It covers only cases of immediate imitation.40No attempt is made to define the sense in which a child's echoic response is 'similar' to the stimulus spoken in the father's bass voice; it seems, though there are no clear statements about this, that Skinner would not accept the account of the phonologist in this respect, but nothing else is offered. The development of an echoic repertoire is attributed completely to differential reinforcement. Since the speaker will do no more, according to Skinner, than what is demanded of him by the verbal community, the degree of accuracy in- sisted on by this community will determine the elements of the repertoire, whatever these may be (not necessarily phonemes). 'In a verbal community which does not insist on a precise correspondence, an echoic repertoire may re- main slack and will be less successfully applied to novel patterns'. There is no discussion of such familiar phenomena as the accuracy with which a child will pick up a second language or a local dialect in the course of playing with other children, which seem sharply in conflict with these assertions. No anthropologi- cal evidence is cited to support the claim that an effective phonemic system does not develop (this is the substance of the quoted remark) in communities that do not insist on precise correspondence.
A verbal response to a written stimulus (reading) is called 'textual behavior'.
looking for one's glasses as in looking for one's watch, in which case I am looking for my glasses and I am looking for my watch are equivalent, under the Skinnerian paraphrase. The difficult questions of purposiveness cannot be handled in this superficial manner.
40 Skinner takes great pains, however, to deny the existence in human beings (or parrots) of any innate faculty or tendency to imitate. His only argument is that no one would suggest an innate tendency to read, yet reading and echoic behavior have similar 'dynamic proper- ties'. This similarity, however, simply indicates the grossness of his descriptive categories.
In the case of parrots, Skinner claims that they have no instinctive capacity to imitate, but only to be reinforced by successful imitation (59). Given Skinner's use of the word 'reinforcement', it is difficult to perceive any distinction here, since exactly the same thing could be said of any other instinctive behavior. For example, where another scientist would say that a certain bird instinctively builds a nest in a certain way, we could say in Skin- ner's terminology (equivalently) that the bird is instinctively reinforced by building the nest in this way. One is therefore inclined to dismiss this claim as another ritual introduction of the word 'reinforce'. Though there may, under some suitable clarification, be some truth in it, it is difficult to see how many of the cases reported by competent observers can be handled if 'reinforcement' is given some substantive meaning. Cf. Thorpe, op.cit. 353 f.; Lorenz, King Solomon's ring 85-8 (New York, 1952); even Mowrer, who tries to show how imitation might develop through secondary reinforcement, cites a case, op.cit. 694, which he apparently believes, but where this could hardly be true. In young children, it seems
most implausible to explain imitation in terms of secondary reinforcement.
￼52 LANGUAGE, VOLUME 35, NUMBER 1 (1959)
Other verbal responses to verbal stimuli are called 'intraverbal operants'. Paradigm instances are the response four to the stimulus two plus two or the response Paris to the stimulus capital of France. Simple conditioning may be suf- ficient to account for the response four to two plus two,41but the notion of intra- verbal response loses all meaning when we find it extended to cover most of the facts of history and many of the facts of science (72, 129); all word association and 'flight of ideas' (73-6); all translations and paraphrase (77); reports of things seen, heard, or remembered (315); and, in general, large segments of scientific, mathematical, and literary discourse. Obviously the kind of explanation that might be proposed for a student's ability to respond with Paris to capital of France, after suitable practice, can hardly be seriously offered to account for his ability to make a judicious guess in answering the questions (to him new) What is the seat of the French government?,... the source of the literary dialect?, ... the chief targetof the Germanblitzkrieg?,etc., or his ability to prove a new theorem, translate a new passage, or paraphrase a remark for the first time or in a new way.
The process of 'getting someone to see a point', to see something your way, or to understand a complex state of affairs (e.g. a difficult political situation or a mathematical proof) is, for Skinner, simply a matter of increasing the strength of the listener's already available behavior.42Since 'the process is often exemplified by relatively intellectual scientific or philosophical discourse', Skinner considers it 'all the more surprising that it may be reduced to echoic, textual, or intraverbal supplementation' (269). Again, it is only the vagueness and latitude with which the notions 'strength' and 'intraverbal response' are used that save this from absurdity. If we use these terms in their literal sense, it is clear that understand- ing a statement cannot be equated to shouting it frequently in a high-pitched voice (high response strength), and a clever and convincing argument cannot be accounted for on the basis of a history of pairings of verbal responses.43
41Though even this possibility is limited. If we were to take these paradigm instances seriously, it should follow that a child who knows how to count from one to 100could learn an arbitrary 10 X 10 matrix with these numbers as entries as readily as the multiplication table.
42 Similarly,'theuniversalityofaliteraryworkreferstothenumberofpotentialreaders inclined to say the same thing' (275;i.e. the most 'universal' work is a dictionary of cliches and greetings); a speaker is 'stimulating' if he says what we are about to say ourselves (272); etc.
43Similarly, consider Skinner's contention (362-5) that communication of knowledge or facts is just the process of making a new response available to the speaker. Here the anal- ogy to animal experiments is particularly weak. When we train a rat to carry out some peculiar act, it makes sense to consider this a matter of adding a response to his repertoire. In the case of human communication, however, it is very difficult to attach any meaning to this terminology. If A imparts to B the information (new to B) that the railroads face col- lapse, in what sense can the response Therailroadsface collapsebe said to be now, but not previously, available to B? Surely B could have said it before (not knowing whether it was true), and known that it was a sentence (as opposed to Collapseface railroads the). Nor is there any reason to assume that the response has increased in strength, whatever this means exactly (e.g. B may have no interest in the fact, or he may want it suppressed). It is not clear how we can characterize this notion of 'making a response available' without reducing Skinner's account of 'imparting knowledge' to a triviality.

10. A final class of operants, called autoclitics, includes those that are involved in assertion, negation, quantification, qualification of responses, construction of sentences, and the 'highly complex manipulations of verbal thinking'. All these acts are to be explained 'in terms of behavior which is evoked by or acts upon other behavior of the speaker' (313). Autoclitics are, then, responses to already given responses, or rather, as we find in reading through this section, they are responses to covert or incipient or potential verbal behavior. Among the auto- clitics are listed such expressions as I recall, I imagine, for example, assume, let X equal ..., the terms of negation, the is of predication and assertion, all, some, if, then, and, in general, all morphemes other than nouns, verbs, and adjectives, as well as grammatical processes of ordering and arrangement. Hardly a remark in this section can be accepted without serious qualification. To take just one example, consider Skinner's account of the autoclitic all in All swans are white (329). Obviously we cannot assume that this is a tact to all swans as stimulus. It is suggested, therefore, that we take all to be an autoclitic modify- ing the whole sentence Swans are white. All can then be taken as equivalent to always, or always it is possible to say. Notice, however, that the modified sentence Swans are white is just as general as All swans are white. Furthermore, the pro- posed translation of all is incorrect if taken literally. It is just as possible to say Swans are green as to say Swans are white. It is not always possible to say either (e.g. while you are saying something else or sleeping). Probably what Skinner means is that the sentence can be paraphrased 'X is white is true, for each swan X'. But this paraphrase cannot be given within his system, which has no place for true.
Skinner's account of grammar and syntax as autoclitic processes (Chapter 13) differs from a familiar traditional account mainly in the use of the pseudoscientific terms 'control' or 'evoke' in place of the traditional 'refer'. Thus in The boy runs,
the final s of runs is a tact under control of such 'subtle properties of a situation' as 'the nature of running as an activity rather than an object or property of an object'.44 (Presumably, then, in The attemptfails, The difficulty remains, His anxiety increases, etc., we must also say that the s indicates that the object described as the attempt is carrying out the activity of failing, etc.) In the boy's gun, however, the s denotes possession (as, presumably, in the boy's arrival,... story, ... age, etc.) and is under the control of this 'relational aspect of the situation' (336). The 'relational autoclitic of order' (whatever it may mean to call the order of a set of responses a response to them) in The boy runs the store is under the control of an 'extremely complex stimulus situation', namely, that the boy is running the store (335). And in thehat and theshoeis under the control of the property 'pair'. Throughin the dog went throughthe hedgeis under the con- trol of the 'relation between the going dog and the hedge' (342). In general, nouns are evoked by objects, verbs by actions, and so on.
Skinner considers a sentence to be a set of key responses (nouns, verbs, ad- jectives) on a skeletal frame (346). If we are concerned with the fact that Sam

rented a leaky boat, the raw responses to the situation are rent, boat, leak, and Sam. Autoclitics (including order) which qualify these responses, express rela- tions between them, and the like, are then added by a process called 'composi- tion' and the result is a grammatical sentence, one of many alternatives among which selection is rather arbitrary. The idea that sentences consist of lexical items placed in a grammatical frame is of course a traditional one, within both philosophy and linguistics. Skinner adds to it only the very implausible specula- tion that in the internal process of composition, the nouns, verbs, and adjectives are chosen first and then are arranged, qualified, etc., by autoclitic responses to these internal activities.45
This view of sentence structure, whether phrased in terms of autoclitics, syncategorematic expressions, or grammatical and lexical morphemes, is in- adequate. Sheep providewool has no (physical) frame at all, but no other arrange- ment of these words is an English sentence. The sequences furiously sleep ideas green colorless and friendly young dogs seem harmless have the same frames, but only one is a sentence of English (similarly, only one of the sequences formed by reading these from back to front). Struggling artists can be a nuisance has the same frame as marking papers can be a nuisance, but is quite different in sentence structure, as can be seen by replacing can be by is or are in both cases. There are many other similar and equally simple examples. It is evident that more is involved in sentence structure than insertion of lexical items in grammatical frames; no approach to language that fails to take these deeper processes into account can possibly achieve much success in accounting for actual linguistic behavior.
11. The preceding discussion covers all the major notions that Skinner intro-
duces in his descriptive system. My purpose in discussing the concepts one by one was to show that in each case, if we take his terms in their literal meaning, the description covers almost no aspect of verbal behavior, and if we take them metaphorically, the description offers no improvement over various traditional formulations. The terms borrowed from experimental psychology simply lose their objective meaning with this extension, and take over the full vagueness of ordinary language. Since Skinner limits himself to such a small set of terms for paraphrase, many important distinctions are obscured. I think that this analysis supports the view expressed in ?1 above, that elimination of the independent contribution of the speaker and learner (a result which Skinner considers of great importance, cf. 311-2) can be achieved only at the cost of eliminating all significance from the descriptive system, which then operates at a level so gross and crude that no answers are suggested to the most elementary questions.46
46 One might just as well argue that exactly the opposite is true. The study of hesitation pauses has shown that these tend to occur before the large categories-noun, verb, adjec- tive; this finding is usually described by the statement that the pauses occur where there is maximum uncertainty or information. Insofar as hesitation indicates on-going composi- tion (if it does at all), it would appear that the 'key responses' are chosen only after the 'grammatical frame'. Cf. C. E. Osgood, unpublished paper; Goldman-Eisler, Speech analy- sis and mental processes, Language and speech 1.67 (1958).

￼REVIEWS 55
The questions to which Skinner has addressed his speculations are hopelessly premature. It is futile to inquire into the causation of verbal behavior until much more is known about the specific character of this behavior; and there is little point in speculating about the process of acquisition without much better understanding of what is acquired.
Anyone who seriously approaches the study of linguistic behavior, whether linguist, psychologist, or philosopher, must quickly become aware of the enor- mous difficulty of stating a problem which will define the area of his investiga- tions, and which will not be either completely trivial or hopelessly beyond the range of present-day understanding and technique. In selecting functional analysis as his problem, Skinner has set himself a task of the latter type. In an extremely interesting and insightful paper,47K. S. Lashley has implicitly delimited a class of problems which can be approached in a fruitful way by the linguist and psychologist, and which are clearly preliminary to those with which Skinner is concerned. Lashley recognizes, as anyone must who seriously con- siders the data, that the composition and production of an utterance is not simply a matter of stringing together a sequence of responses under the control of outside stimulation and intraverbal association, and that the syntactic organi- zation of an utterance is not something directly represented in any simple way in the physical structure of the utterance itself. A variety of observations lead him to conclude that syntactic structure is 'a generalized pattern imposed on the specific acts as they occur', and that 'a consideration of the structure of the
sentence and other motor sequences will show ... that there are, behind the overtly expressed sequences, a multiplicity of integrative processes which can only be inferred from the final results of their activity'. He also comments on the great difficulty of determining the 'selective mechanisms' used in the actual construction of a particular utterance.
Although present-day linguistics cannot provide a precise account of these integrative processes, imposed patterns, and selective mechanisms, it can at least set itself the problem of characterizing these completely. It is reasonable to regard the grammar of a language L ideally as a mechanism that provides
what stimuli are in 'control' in a specific case? When are stimuli 'similar'? And so on. (It is not interesting to be told e.g. that we say Stop to an automobile or billiard ball because they are sufficiently similar to reinforcing people [46].)
The use of unanalyzed notions like 'similar' and 'generalization' is particularly dis- turbing, since it indicates an apparent lack of interest in every significant aspect of the learning or the use of language in new situations. No one has ever doubted that in some sense, language is learned by generalization, or that novel utterances and situations are in some way similar to familiar ones. The only matter of serious interest is the specific 'simi- larity'. Skinner has, apparently, no interest in this. Keller and Schoenfeld (op.cit.) proceed to incorporate these notions (which they identify) into their Skinnerian 'modernobjective psychology' by defining two stimuli to be similar when 'we make the same sort of response to them' (124;but when are responses of the 'same sort'?). They do not seem to notice that this definition converts their 'principle of generalization' (116), under any reasonable in- terpretation of this, into a tautology. It is obvious that such a definition will not be of much help in the study of language learning or construction of new responses in appropriate situations.

an enumeration of the sentences of L in something like the way in which a deduc- tive theory gives an enumeration of a set of theorems. ('Grammar', in this sense of the word, includes phonology.) Furthermore, the theory of language can be regarded as a study of the formal properties of such grammars, and, with a precise enough formulation, this general theory can provide a uniform method for determining, from the process of generation of a given sentence, a structural description which can give a good deal of insight into how this sentence is used and understood. In short, it should be possible to derive from a properly formu- lated grammar a statement of the integrative processes and generalized patterns imposed on the specific acts that constitute an utterance. The rules of a gram- mar of the appropriate form can be subdivided into the two types, optional and obligatory; only the latter must be applied in generating an utterance. The optional rules of the grammar can be viewed, then, as the selective mechanisms involved in the production of a particular utterance. The problem of specifying these integrative processes and selective mechanisms is nontrivial and not be- yond the range of possible investigation. The results of such a study might, as Lashley suggests, be of independent interest for psychology and neurology (and conversely). Although such a study, even if successful, would by no means answer the major problems involved in the investigation of meaning and the causation of behavior, it surely will not be unrelated to these. It is at least possible, fur- thermore, that such notions as 'semantic generalization', to which such heavy appeal is made in all approaches to language in use, conceal complexities and specific structure of inference not far different from those that can be studied and exhibited in the case of syntax, and that consequently the general character of the results of syntactic investigations may be a corrective to oversimplified approaches to the theory of meaning.
The behavior of the speaker, listener, and learner of language constitutes, of course, the actual data for any study of language. The construction of a grammar which enumerates sentences in such a way that a meaningful structural descrip- tion can be determined for each sentence does not in itself provide an account of this actual behavior. It merely characterizes abstractly the ability of one who has mastered the language to distinguish sentences from nonsentences, to understand new sentences (in part), to note certain ambiguities, etc. These are very remarkable abilities. We constantly read and hear new sequences of words, recognize them as sentences, and understand them. It is easy to show that the new events that we accept and understand as sentences are not related to those with which we are familiar by any simple notion of formal (or semantic or sta- tistical) similarity or identity of grammatical frame. Talk of generalization in this case is entirely pointless and empty. It appears that we recognize a new item as a sentence not because it matches some familiar item in any simple way, but because it is generated by the grammar that each individual has somehow and in some form internalized. And we understand a new sentence, in part, because we are somehow capable of determining the process by which this sentence is derived in this grammar.
Suppose that we manage to construct grammars having the properties out- lined above. We can then attempt to describe and study the achievement of the speaker, listener, and learner. The speaker and the listener, we must assume,
￼REVIEWS 57
have already acquired the capacities characterized abstractly by the grammar. The speaker's task is to select a particular compatible set of optional rules. If we know, from grammatical study, what choices are available to him and what conditions of compatibility the choices must meet, we can proceed meaningfully to investigate the factors that lead him to make one or another choice. The listener (or reader) must determine, from an exhibited utterance, what optional rules were chosen in the construction of the utterance. It must be admitted that the ability of a human being to do this far surpasses our present understanding. The child who learns a language has in some sense constructed the grammar for himself on the basis of his observation of sentences and nonsentences (i.e. cor- rections by the verbal community). Study of the actual observed ability of a speaker to distinguish sentences from nonsentences, detect ambiguities, etc., apparently forces us to the conclusion that this grammar is of an extremely com- plex and abstract character, and that the young child has succeeded in carrying out what from the formal point of view, at least, seems to be a remarkable type of theory construction. Furthermore, this task is accomplished in an astonish- ingly short time, to a large extent independently of intelligence, and in a com- parable way by all children. Any theory of learning must cope with these facts.
It is not easy to accept the view that a child is capable of constructing an extremely complex mechanism for generating a set of sentences, some of which he has heard, or that an adult can instantaneously determine whether (and if so, how) a particular item is generated by this mechanism, which has many of the properties of an abstract deductive theory. Yet this appears to be a fair description of the performance of the speaker, listener, and learner. If this is correct, we can predict that a direct attempt to account for the actual behavior of speaker, listener, and learner, not based on a prior understanding of the struc-
ture of grammars, will achieve very limited success. The grammar must be re- garded as a component in the behavior of the speaker and listener which can only be inferred, as Lashley has put it, from the resulting physical acts. The fact that all normal children acquire essentially comparable grammars of great complexity with remarkable rapidity suggests that human beings are somehow specially designed to do this, with data-handling or 'hypothesis-formulating' ability of unknown character and complexity.48The study of linguistic structure
48 There is nothing essentially mysterious about this. Complex innate behavior patterns and innate 'tendencies to learn in specific ways' have been carefully studied in lower or- ganisms. Many psychologists have been inclined to believe that such biological structure will not have an important effect on acquisition of complex behavior in higher organisms, but I have not been able to find any serious justification for this attitude. Some recent studies have stressed the necessity for carefully analyzing the strategies available to the organism, regarded as a complex 'information-processing system' (cf. Bruner, Goodnow, andAustin,Astudyofthinking[NewYork,1956];Newell,Shaw,andSimon,Elementsofa theory of human problem solving, Psych. rev. 65.151-66 [1958]), if anything significant is to be said about the character of human learning. These may be largely innate, or devel- oped by early learning processes about which very little is yet known. (But see Harlow, The formation of learning sets, Psych. rev. 56.51-65 (1949), and many later papers, where strik- ing shifts in the character of learning are shown as a result of early training; also Hebb, Organizationof behavior109ff.) They are undoubtedly quite complex. Cf. Lenneberg, op.cit., and Lees, review of Chomsky's Syntactic structuresin Lg. 33.406f. (1957), for discussion of
the topics mentioned in this section.
￼58 LANGUAGE, VOLUME 35, NUMBER 1 (1959)
may ultimately lead to some significant insights into this matter. At the moment the question cannot be seriously posed, but in principle it may be possible to study the problem of determining what the built-in structure of an information- processing (hypothesis-forming) system must be to enable it to arrive at the grammar of a language from the available data in the available time. At any rate, just as the attempt to eliminate the contribution of the speaker leads to a
'mentalistic' descriptive system that succeeds only in blurring important tradi- tional distinctions, a refusal to study the contribution of the child to language learning permits only a superficial account of language acquisition, with a vast and unanalyzed contribution attributed to a step called 'generalization' which in fact includes just about everything of interest in this process. If the study of language is limited in these ways, it seems inevitable that major aspects of verbal behavior will remain a mystery.
The measurement of meaning. By CHARLESE. OSGOOD,GEORGEJ. SUCI, and PERCYH. TANNENBAUM.Pp. [vii], 342. Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 1957.
ReviewedbyJOHNB.CARROLLH,arvardUniversity
The title of this book provides scant indication of the wide-angle view which the authors have given of a variety of subjects in psycholinguistics and the study of communication processes in both their theoretical and their practical aspects. One can find a little of everything, from pure psychological theory (in the tradi- tion of Clark L. Hull), personality theory, and attitude research, to journalism and advertising. All this is by way of presenting the rationale and the uses of the measuring technique which Osgood has called the semantic differential (here- after SD). Linguists will be most concerned to learn how the authors have dealt with what they call meaning and how the SD can aid in the development of the branch of linguistics which is covered by the widely used and misused term semantics.
Both in the introduction and towards the close of the book (318) the reader is warned that it represents largely a 'progress report'; he is asked therefore to discount the 'tone of assurance not actually felt'. Certainly he cannot but admire the energy and imagination with which the studies described in this volume have been pursued; he will take note of the fact that psychologists here, there, and everywhere have been quick to adopt the SD as a tool of broad usefulness.' But he will ponder. Indeed, the authors predict (320) that he will raise ques- tions-about whether the SD is really a measure of 'meaning', about whether there are really only three main dimensions of the 'semantic space', and about how much the results of SD research can contribute to our understanding of the nature of meaning.

Structuralism

Bloomfield structuralism in American, originated with Saussuer's 'Course in General Linguistics' from 1916.  Bloomfield was sympathetic to Watson's behaviorism. Structuralism in Europe became identified with sympathetic movements in Anthropology (), Psychoanalysis and Marxism, but is largely known through the critiques by the 'Post-Structuralists' who rejected that movement.

Bloomfieldian structuralism was different.

Chomsky 1957:
3.1: argues for 'levels of representation' as necessary for adequate explanation. This is a theme throughout cognitive science, articulated most clearly in the work of David Marr.

2.1	Explicit analogy to mathematical, formal languages, and the rejection of the Markov machine as adequate.  This argument is simple and easy enough to repeat.
 Big point: pg 32. Linguistic processing requires 'phrasing' – which is analogous to Millers' 'chunking' in memory, and potentially analogous to the Gestalt's categorization.

iple 8. Client Relationship. The psy- t informs his prospective client of the im- aspects of the potential relationship that affect the client's decision to enter the rela-
Aspects of the relationship likely to affect the client's dccision include the recording of an interview, the use of interview material for training purposes, and observation of an interview by other persons.
When the client is not competent to evaluate tbe
situation (as in the case of a child)' the person ,, reponsible for the client is informed of the circum-
strnces rvhich may influence the relationship.
Xle psychologist does not normally enter into a pro- .fessional relationship with members of his own family, intimate friends, close associates, or others whose velfare might be jeopardized by such a dual relation- ,stip.
9. Impersonal Services. Psycholog- lcrvices for the purpose of diagnosis, treatment, lized advice are provided only in the
of a professional relationship and are not by means of public lectures or demonstra-
newspaper or magazine articles, radio or programs, mail, or similar media.
I]be preparation of personnel reports and recom- Irmdations based on test data secured solely by mail l,b unethical unless such appraisals are an integral part nl a continuing client relationship with a company, $ a result of which the consulting psychologist has c knowledge of the ctent's personnel situation lud can be assured thereby that his written appraisals .iill be adequate to the purpose and will be properly
ed by the client. These reports must not embellished with such detailed analyses of the sub- personality traits as would be appropriate only intensive interviews with the subject. The
nrust not make specific recommendations as tmplolment or placement of the subject which go the psychologist's knou'ledge of the job re-
quirements of the company. The reports must not purport to eliminate the company's need to carry on such other regular employment or personnel practices as appraisal of the work history, ctrecking of refer- ences, past performance in the company.
Principle 10. Announcement of Services. A psychologist adheres to professional rather than commercial standards in making known his avail- ability for professional services.
a. A psychologist does not directly solicit clients for individual diagnosis or therapy.
b. Individual listings in telephone directories are limited to name, highest relevant degree, certifrcation status, address, and telephone number. They may also in- clude identification in a few words of the psychologist's major areas of practice; for example, child tberapy, personnel selection, industrial psychology. Agency listings are equally modest.
c. Announcements of individual private practice are limited to a simple statement of the name, higbest relevant degree, certification or diplomate status, address, telephone number, offrce hours, and a brief explanation of the types of services rendered. An- nouncements of agencies may list names of stafr members with their qualifications. They conform in other particulars with the same standards as in-
dividual announcements, making certain that the true
nature of the organization is apparent.
d. A psychologist or agency announcing noncliuical pro-
fessional services may use brochures that are descrip- tive of services rendered but not evaluative. They may be sent to professional persons, schools, business firms, government agencies, and other similar organiza- tions.
e. The use in a brochure of "testimonials from satisfied users" is unacceptable. The offer of a free trial of services is unacceptable if it operates to misrepresent in any way the nature or the efficacy of the services rendered by the psychologist. Claims that a psy- chologist has unique skills or unique devices not available to others in the profession are made only if the special efficacy of these unique skills or devices has been demonstrated by scientifically acceptable
evidence.
f. The psychologist must not encourage (nor, within his
porver, even allow) a client to bave exaggerated ideas as to the efficacy of services rendered. Claims made to clients about the efficacy of his services must not go beyond those which the psychologist would be willing to subjcct to professional scrutiny through publishing his results and his claims in a professional journal.
Principle 11. Interprofessional Relations. A psychologist acts with integrity in regard to col- leagues in psychology and in other professions.
a. A psychologist does not normally offer professional services to a person rcceiving psychological assistance from anotber professional worker except by agxeement

History of classifications of mental illness

While behaviors associated with mental illness—hallucinations, catatonic states, mania, etc.—have been known since ancient times, psychiatry dates its regularization as a scientific discipline to the work of the French physician Phillipe Pinel. His Traité médico-philosophique sur l'aliénation mentale; ou la manie stands as the first attempt at a scientific classification of mental illness. The book, translated as Treatise on Insanity in 1806 by D.D. Davis, is excerpted in Appendix Error! Reference source not found. on page Error! Bookmark not defined..  
Pinel was an intellectual disciple of Étienne Bonnot de Condillac, who in turn, was a disciple of John Locke. Locke is most well known as the intellectual progenitor of the American Constitution. But his views on the nature of mind and the empirical basis of knowledge held sway over much of the Western intellectual world in the first half of the 19th century.   Locke's influence on Condillac and hence Pinel was two-fold: first, he held that all our ideas originate in sensation and reflection. Second, and as importantly, Locke followed Francis Bacon in teaching that all knowledge must be based on careful, systematic observation.
For the empiricists, it follows that insanity, which is a severe form of our ideas 'leading us astray', is explained by a incorrect connection and association of ideas. The mechanism is simple: some of our ideas have a natural affinity or connection with one another. Others are held together by mere custom or habit. Cases of insanity are cases where habitual associations become so disorganized they begin to effect the 'natural' associations. This misassociation can become so extreme that it can “set us awry in our actions, as well moral as natural, passions, reasonings, and notions themselves” (Bk 2, Ch 33, p9. p 317). It is worth noting that to this day, we use metaphors like 'lost his senses' to describe someone with mental illness; and we describe poorly chosen actions as 'not very sensible.'
This is simply the theoretical basis for understanding insanity in the broadest possible terms.  To truly understand how mental disorder is defined and classified, we must consider how the mentally ill have been treated.
Pinel – Foundation in Empiricism
Phillipe Pinel (1745-1826) revolutionized the treatment of the insane. When, in 1792, he was appointed a physician at the main asylum in Paris—the Bicêtre hospital—the situation was dire. According to a biographer in 1846:
 “The buildings were unfit for habitation. In them were congregated men crouching together in the mud, in stone cells, narrow, cold, damp, destitute of air and light, and merely furnished with a straw bed, seldom renewed, and soon becoming foul and offensive; wretched dens, in which one would hesitate to place the meanest animal. The insane, who were immured in these filthy holes, were at the mercy of their attendants, and these persons were malefactors released from prison. The wretched patients were loaded with chains and manacled like convicts. Thus given up defenseless to the wickedness of their guardians, they were the sports of an insulting mockery, or of a brutality all the more blind that it was gratuitous.” (Marx, 1846, p. 194-195)
Upon his arrival, Pinel immediately began advocating pity, respect, and compassion for the patients, not only for humanitarian reasons, but also in order to allow the Baconian method of careful observation. Bicêtre's chief physician, Pussin, was sympathetic to Pinel's techniques, and began a pilot study of unchaining the patients.


Two years later, Pinel was appointed  chief physician of the Hospice de la Salpêtrière—Paris' parallel institution for women. There, the women were kept chained, often naked, in subterranean cells; subjected to the terrors of abusive guards and hungry rats. Pinel immediate banned the use of metal chains as restraints, allowed the women clothing, and established something resembling human civility. This act was mythologized during the French Revolution as part of the overthrow of the aristocratic order, and has been duly commemorated in Art.
Pinel's revolutionary kindness is not just a story of a sympathetic humanitarian.  Pinel's goal was to  systematical classify mental illness in the Baconian manner.  The conditions of confinement found in the Bicêtre and the Salpêtrière compounded the patients' mental illness, and confounded his attempts at observation. In these conditions, one could not determine if the regularity of symptoms found in the population resulted from the illness or the treatment. By providing the patients respect and dignity, he believed he could observe their mental illness in a more untainted form.
In general, Pinel followed Locke and Condillac in holding that insanity was 'derangement of the understanding,' yet extended the view to cover cases where the memory, understanding and judgment were perfectly sound, and still the patient was maniacal. Pinel thus abandoned any formal all-encompassing theoretical explanation of insanity per se, and preferred to work with its variants, which he classified as mania, melancholy, dementia and idiocy.
Pinel spent a great amount of time showing that the conditions he was treating did not have a physiological basis. Much of his argumentation in Treatise on Insanity turns on the dissections performed on patients who had died while at the Bicêtre. The reason for this was two-fold: first, the ancient Aristotlean understanding of the mind held that mental illness resulted from too much or too little of one of the four main 'humours': black bile, yellow bile, blood and phlegm.  By showing that the mentally ill had no significant lesions in the brain, or imbalances in their 'fluids', Pinel was able to establish the independence of psychiatry from other forms of medicine.
Secondly, there is a long tradition of defining the 'mental' as that which is opposed to the 'physical'. For example, Rene Descartes famously argues that the actions of our bodies can be explained entirely in physical, mechanistic terms, except that which can be attributed to, in his terms, our 'souls.'  It follows then, that if an illness is to be truly mental, it must not have a physical explanation. And most importantly, physical causes are treated with physical interventions. As insanity was now deemed non-physical, the treatment cannot be physical. Hence, psychiatry is a discipline independent from physical medicine.
While Pinel had no strong theoretical commitment or agenda, by following Locke's notion of mental illness as a confusion of ideas, he made two significant contributions to both psychiatry as a medical discipline and our understanding of the mind more broadly: First, if insanity was just a misassociation of ideas, it was not a permanent, inherited incurable disease. Second, if insanity is a misassociation of ideas, it does not depend on or result from physiological changes. Explanations for mental illness thus did not require autopsy; and treatment did not require surgery.
It is likewise important to recognize that Pinel was, in many ways, precisely following Bacon's system of investigation. He was not attempting to form an overarching explanation. He was setting down tables upon tables of observed facts, classifying and arranging phenomena, highlighting privileged instances, and was open to any and all techniques that might shed light on these cases. After initial observation, he split “insanity” into four varieties, distinguishing between the incurable dementia and idiocy from the often transient and curable mania and melancholy.
Therapeutically, Pinel called his humane treatment of the insane the 'moral treatment.' In his words,
I then discovered, that insanity was curable in many instances, by mildness of treatment and attention to the state of the mind exclusively, and when coercion was indispensable, that it might be very effectually applied without corporal indignity. (p. 108).
His therapeutic program meant paying attention to the environment in which the insane were confined. He changed the architecture, the diet, the way the nurses and orderlies treated the patients, everything.  He even went so far as to allow the higher-functioning patients to work as nurses for the lower-functioning. Patients were listened to. Careful, detailed personal histories were taken. Baths, walking and gardening were encouraged.
Pinel frequently borrowed from the snake-oil salesmen and charlatans that populated Western Europe at the time.  He used of the techniques of mesmerism (hypnosis), hellebore as an evacuative, bleeding, etc. , but as a follower of Bacon, insisted on the maxim “We cannot cure diseases by the resources of art, if not previously acquainted with their terminations, when left to the unassisted efforts of nature.” (p. 109). For him, extreme treatments could only be used in extreme cases. The curable would be cured by simple humane treatment.
It is worth pointing out that the word 'asylum' means, of course, a sanctuary or refuge. It was used in the late 18th century to describe leper colonies, but it first appears in English in the 1808 translation of Pinel's Treatise on Insanity, to reference the Bicêtre. It appears in English newspapers only in the 1860's, long after Pinel's 'moral treatment' had come to dominate the English treatment of the mentally ill.
Esquirol – Mental Alienation
While Pinel tended to think of transient mental illness as a confusion of ideas, he occassionally spoke of the role of passions in mental illness.  In the early pages of the Treatise, he hypotheses three different causes of insanity:
I now proceed to describe the general progress of periodical insanity. Amoung its various causes; exclusive of changes in the state of the atmosphere, my experience leads me to enumerate as the most frequent; undue indulgence of the angry passions; any circumstances calculated to suggest the recollection of the original exciting cause of the disease, intemperance in drinking, inanition, &amp;c. (p. 12)
Pinel's greatest student, Esquirol built on this hypothesis of 'undue indulgence of the angry passions' and redefined the notion of transient insanity as 'mental alienation.' It was Esquirol who grew the empirical understanding of the mind into a full-fledged psychiatric system. But like Pinel, the set of conditions he sought to explain were those with symptoms that were not obviously explained by physical, bodily conditions.
To Pinel's four-fold classification, Esquirol added monomania, or obsession with a single idea, as distinct kind of mental illness.  'Melancholy,' he renamed 'lypemania.' because the former implied the medieval theory of 'humors' and  'black bile.' These were distinguished by the types of passions that were out of order: “The passions of the insane are impetuous, especially in mania and monomania. They are of a depressing character in lypemania. In dementia and imbecility, those only exist, which spring from the first wants of man,--love, anger, jealousy.” (p 26).  
As the curable, transient forms of insanity were diseases of malformed passions, their treatment required reforming or redirecting the passions. His five varieties of insanity are defined thus:
1.	Lypemania (melancholy of the ancients) delirium with respect to one, or a small number of objects, with predominance of a sorrowful and depressing passion.
2.	Monomania, in which the delirium is  limited to one or a small number of objects, with excitement, and predominance of a gay, and expansive passion.
3.	Mania, in which the delirium extends to all kids of objects, and is accompanied by excitement.
4.	Dementia, win which the insensate utter folly, because the organs of thought have lost their energy, and the strength requisite to fulfill their functions.
5.	Imbecility, or idiocy, in which the conformation of the organs has never been such, that hose who are thus afflicted, could reason justly. (29)
It is important to note here that the passions accompany delirium with respect to collections of objects.  One cannot be passionate without being passionate about something. The 'something' that is the object of passion is supplied by the senses – and hence, we're still within a Lockean framework of understanding the mind.  Ideas originate in sense experience and internal reflection. When the passions directed at one of these ideas becomes excessive of out of control, lypemania or monomania results, depending on the nature of the particular passion that becomes excessive. When the passions are exaggerated without a specific object, and hence apply themselves to every object, or what ever object is before the senses at a particular moment, mania results.
Mental illness's causes “are as numerous as its forms are varied.”  Case studies presented in his Mental Maladies include climate, seasons, age, sex, temperament, trauma (especially during the first menstrual cycle for young women), excessive study, ambition, etc. Again, as in Pinel, the difference between the mentally ill and the mentally stable is one of scale, not of kind.  Everyone has passions – they are why we grieve, fall in love, work for that 'A', make personal sacrifices for our friends and families, etc. – the question of insanity is whether these passions are appropriate or excessive and whether they are directed at an appropriate or inappropriate object.
According to Esquirol:
“The first wants of man, limiting themselves to those connected with his preservation and reproduction, provoke the determinations of instinct; an internal impulse leads us to gratify them.
The secondary wants, attach themselves to the first, and the desires which they excite, acquire as much more energy, as we have means of satisfying them, They produce the primitive passions; in fine, they are the wants which are connected with our preservation; and are the fruit of our increasing intelligence and civilization. They engender the factitious passions,—those passions which cause the greatest injury to man, especially in the higher walks of life.
Infancy, except from the influence of the passions, is almost a stranger to insanity; but at the epoch of puberty, the sentiments, unknown until this period, cause new wants to arise. Insanity then appears, to trouble the first moments of the moral existence of man.
At mature age, the relations become extended, social wants multiple and the passions take a new character. In proportion as the amorous passions become enfeebled, those of a factitious nature grow strong. Personal interest, ambition, love of distinction and avarice, replace the charms of love and delights of paternity.
At this period of life also, mental alienation appears; insanity is more obstinate, and more concentrated. It passes more readily into a chronic state; and is more dependent upon abdominal lesions.
A sense of his weakness, renders the old man more clam; and while meditating upon the errors to which the passions lead, he isolates himself, and becomes an egotist.
Insanity from a moral cause, rarely exists with him, and when he loses his reason, it is because his organs are fatigued and exhausted. Hence, it is neither mania nor monomania which is developed, at this period, but senile dementia.
Of all moral causes, those which most frequently produce insanity, are pride, fear, fright, ambition, reverses of fortune, and domestic trouble. This last should have been placed, relative to its great influence, at the head of the moral causes, if it be limited to a simple ideas; but by domesticate troubles, I express all the pains, all the griefs, all oppositions, misfortunes and dissensions that grow out of the family state.
(Mental Maladies: A Treatise on Insanity, p 45-46)
Esquirol began to gather around himself a 'circle' of students who are sometimes referred to as the 'mental alienists'. Two of the most famous of his students were Charles Lasègue, who is now credited with working out the first definition of hysteria and documenting anorexia nervosa; and Étienne-Jean Georget who delineated four sub-types of 'monomania': theomania (religious obsession), ertomania (sexual obsession), demonomania (obsession with evil) and homocidal monomania.
squirol's concept of monomania sparked what is probably the first recorded wave of copy-cat psychosis.  In November 1825, a young single mother of two named Henriette Cornier, decapitated the 19 month-old child of her neighbors. She had prepared her room for the act, even placing a bucket to catch the blood. She had known the family of the infant for only ten days, and had, up until this event, been nothing but loving and gentle towards the little girl who would be her victim. When the police arrived, she offered no resistance to the police, and did not flee. She confessed, saying that the idea had taken hold of her, and she simply had to act upon it.
The case became a sensation across Europe. Georget diagnosed her as a 'homicidal monomaniac.' At her trial, the jury decided that the act had not been premediated and as a result, she was sentenced to life in prison with hard labor instead of death. This ruling makes little sense: Cornier admitted that the idea had occurred to her before the event, and she had carefully prepared her room for the murder. Thus, many commentators—include Lisa Appengasi (p 75)—have attributed the decision to Georget's diagnosis of mental alienation. After all, if Cornier was mentally ill, does pre-planning count as 'premediation'?
The idea of the murderous monomaniac took off across Europe, informing or appearing in some of the greatest literature of era, including (according to various literary critics) Poe's “The Tell-Tale Heart,” the character of Roskolvikov in Dostovesky's Crime and Punishment, and even Heathcliff in Bonte's Wutherheights. The Marquis de Sade is also said to have been a monomaniac.
Beard – American Nervousness
George Beard (1839-1883) was an American physician who started out advocating for the use of electricity as a medical intervention.  His first book Electricity as a Tonic (1866) suggested that electricity could be used to cure 'general nervous debility,' including dyspepsia, chorea, neuralgia, anaemia, or amenorrhoea. (1867, p. 73) Beard was a charismatic popular author, who went on to write a series of popular home-healthcare books starting with Our Home Physician: Handy Book of Family Medicine in 1869.
Starting in the 1870s, Beard became increasingly interested in psychological disorders. In 1881, he published American Nervousness, a book that came to define psychological treatment for a generation.  'Nervousness' did not mean then what it means today: jitteriness or tension. Then, it denoted a kind of fundamental exhaustion—what we still call a 'nervous breakdown'.  Technically, Beard defined it as:


“deficiency of lack of nerve-force. This condition, together with all the symptoms of diseases that are evolved from it, has developed mainly within the nineteenth century, and is especially frequent and severe in the Northern and Eastern portions of the United States. Nervousness, in the sense here used, is to be distinguished rigidly and systematically from simple excess of emotion and from organic disease.” (1881, p. vi)
It was caused by “modern civilization, which is distinguished from the ancient by these five characteristics: steam-power, the periodical press, the telegraph, the sciences, and the mental activity of women.” (p. vi)
Beard was building on both folk theory of innate energy as well as recent discoveries in neurology (compare, for example, the concurrent theory of 'specific sense energies' proposed by  Müller – see the Error! Reference source not found.). But he extended his view to cover diseases such as “neurasthenia (nervous exhaustion... hysteria, hay-fever, sick-headache, inebriety... some and phases of insanity.” (p. vii) whose 'signs' could include:
The nervous diathesis; susceptibility to stimulants and narcotics and various drugs, and consequent necessity of temperance; increase of the nervous diseases inebriety and neurasthenia (nervous exhaustion), hay-fever neuralgia, nervous dyspepsia, asthenopia and allied diseases and symptoms; early and rapid decay of teeth; premature baldness; sensitiveness to cold and heat; increase of diseases not exclusively nervous, as diabetes and certain forms of Bright's disease of the kidneys and chronic catarrhs; unprecedented beauty of American women; frequency of trance and muscle-reading; the strain of dentition, puberty and change of life; American oratory, humor speech and language; change in type of disease during the past half century, and the great intensity of animal life on this continent. (p. vii-ix)
Beard died shortly after the publication of American Nervousness,but his cause was taken up by Silas Wier Mitchell (1829-1914), who popularized the standard treatment for American Nervousness: the rest cure. As you can probably imagine, if the cause of American Nervousness was modern civilization, including women having a mental life, the cure was removal from modern civilization, including banning women from having a mental life.
In 1885, at the age of 25, Charlotte Perkins Gilman, a member of a prominent family of American progressives that included the abolitionist author Harriet Beecher Stowe, the suffragist Isabella Beecher Hooker, and the charismatic clergyman Henry Ward Beecher, gave birth to her only child Katharine Beecher Stetson. After the birth, she experienced what we now recognize as a severe case of post-partum depression.
She was taken to see Silas Wier Mitchell. She described her experience of the treatment she received thus:
“During about the third year of this trouble I went, in devout faith and some faint stir of hope, to a noted specialist in nervous diseases, the best known in the country.  This wise man put me to bed and applied the rest-cure, to which all still-good physique responded so promptly that he concluded there was nothing much the matter with me, and sent me home with solemn advice to 'live as domestic a life as far as possible,' to 'have but two hours' intellectual life a day' and 'never touch a pen, brush or pencil again' as long as I lived. This was in 1887.” (“Why I wrote The Yellow Wallpaper, 1913)
Her experiences you may know from the American Standard The Yellow Wallpaper (1892). Gilman acknowledged that she never suffered from the hallucinations the character did, but that she “came so near the borderline of mental ruin that I could see over.” (1913)
While Beard and Wier Mitchell are today often ridiculed as snake-oil salesmen playing on the political concerns over rapid modernization and the suffragist movement, they made a number of notable contributions to our commonsense understanding of psychological disorder. First, they indelibly linked mental disorders to neurology. As mentioned above, we still use phrases like 'nervous breakdown' in common parlance to explain psychological disorder. Second, by proscribing puberty, birth, menopause and the 'unprecedented beauty of American women' as prime causes of mental illness, they further established a link between the onset and frustration of sexuality with mental illness, a point Freud would build his entire theory around.
It would be a mistake, however, to accept the simplistic narrative that the doctors of this era were manipulating and abusing their female patients without consent. Historians of Psychology Laura C. Ball and Jennifer L. Bazar have recently demonstrated that in some cases, some women aggressive sought out procedures, such as clitorectomies, in this period. In one remarkable case, a patient even 'tormented the doctors to operate again.'
On way to chart the rise of psychiatric diagnosis is to consider how people with mental illness are counted.  Starting in 1830, the US census included categories for the disabled, including 'blind' and 'deaf.' From 1840-1870, the census included the category 'idiocy/insanity.' Starting in 1880, however, the federal government began using categories of mental illness. In 1880, those categories were:
21 Mental Disease, Insanity
      00 Melancholy
      01 Mania
      02 Hysteria
      03 Nerves
      04 Dementia
      05 Insane (not elsewhere classified)
22 Mental Retardation, Idiocy
      00 Idiotic
Table 1: Classifications of 1880

Readers of these sections will no doubt recognize this taxonomy as owing an intellectual debt to Esquirol and Beard.
Charcot
Charcot began his career at the Salpêtrière tending to the 'incurables'—the patients whose conditions had been classified as 'idiocy' or 'dementia.' Charcot saw himself primarily as a nosologist: a classifier or taxonomizer of disease, rather than a healer. His appointment was, in many ways, ideal. This was a patient population for which there was no hope of cure, and morever, had not been studied in a careful way.  
Charcot is, today, often classified as a neurologist. That is a bit of historicism, as there was no such field when he began work.  In fact, the 'neuron doctrine', or the idea that the nervous system is composed of individual cells called 'neurons,' is not formally advanced until 1891.  And it isn't until 1911 that Ramon y Cajal uses the Golgi stain to highlight neurons in the hippocampus, confirming the neuron doctrine.
None of that stopped Charcot from classifying a huge number conditions and diseases we still recognize today: multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS or “Lou Gerig's disease,” it was once called “Charcot's disease”), lenticulostriate artery (“Charcot's artery”), joint arthopathy (“Charcot's joint”), peroneal muscular atrophy (“Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease”), Charcot Wilbrand syndrome, Charcot's intermittent hepatic fever and even Parkinson's disease were first named or described by Charcot.
Methodologically, Charcot advocated what he called the 'anatomo-clinical' method, which meant careful anatomical analysis performed largely post-mortum combined with case studies of vivisection in both animals and human subjects. Once a behavioral deficiency has been identified, careful anatomical studies are carried out to determine any corresponding anatomical 'deficiency,' or lesion. In his own words:
Allow me to recall to your minds the opinion which that most illustrious physiologist, Claude Bernard, thus expressed:—“Pathology,” said he, “should not he subordinated to physiology. Quite the reverse. Set up first the medical problem which arises from the observation of a malady, and afterwards seek for a physiological explanation. To act otherwise would be to risk overlooking the patient, and distorting the malady.” These are excellent words, which I have ventured to quote verbatim, because they are absolutely significant. They enable us to clearly understand that the whole domain of pathology appertains strictly to the physician, who alone can cultivate it and make it fruitful, and that it necessarily remains closed to the physiologist who, systematically confined within the precincts of his laboratory, disdains the teaching of the hospital ward. (p. 8)
In 1878, he began extensive work on hypnosis. Charcot became increasingly interested in the therapeutic use of hypnosis to cure what he called 'hysteria', a vaguely-defined collection of usually transient symptoms that included paralysis, anesthesias, visual or auditory agnosias, temporary blindness or deafness, amnesia and seizures. While 'hysteria' came to be identified closely with women, Charcot himself believed that it could effect men, and treated many men that he diagnosed with hysteria.
This does not mean, however, that Charcot gave up his commitment to neurological explanations of behavior. He simply allowed functional and/or physiological explanations in addition to the anatomical. In his words:
There is another important fact in the history of neuroses in general, and of hysteria in particular, which clearly shows that these diseases do not form, in pathology, a class apart, governed by other physiological laws than the common ones. (13)
I've quoted this passage because it is the first use of the word 'neuroses.'  It's root in neurological terminology is obvious, but here Charcot uses itto demarcate transient, psychological, functional or dynamic neurological conditions from the incurable, intransient, anatomical neurological conditions we still classify as medical. 'Neurosis' thus supplants 'mental alienation' and 'nervousness' as the descriptor of the set of psychological conditions that cannot be explained physically.
In 1890, blocked by antisemitism in Germany from further education, a young Sigmund Freud, came to study with M. Charcot. There, he learned the techniques of hypnosis. Later in life, Freud frequently referred to Charcot as his 'mentor,' and even attributed the idea that all neuroses originate 'in the genitals' to Charcot.
In his eulogy for Charcot, Sigmund Freud said:
He was not a reflective man, not a thinker: He had the nature of an artist—he was, as he himself said, a 'visuel', a man who sees... He used to look again and again at the things he did not understand, to deepen his impression of them day by day, till suddenly an understanding of them dawned on him.  In his mind's eye the apparent chaos presented by the continual repetition of the same symptoms then ave way to order: the new nosological picture emerged, characterized by the constant combination of certain groups of symptoms... He might be heard to say that the greatest satisfaction a man could have was to see something new-- that is, to recognize it as new; and he remarked against and again n the difficulty and value of this kind of 'seeing'. (Quoted in Mad, Bad and Sad, p. 128)
It should be fairly obvious that Freud here is describing, essentially, the Baconian approach to scientific classification. Careful, close observation with only careful, conservative theoretical suppositions. Freud, of course, became famous for his theoretical suppositions later in life. Whereas Charcot was content with describing neuroses and localizing them in the nervous system, Freud sought to explain the origins of neuroses in non-physical terms.
Freud &amp; Breuer
By the time the late 19th century arrives, we are beginning to find general agreement that mental illnesses are characterized by symptoms with no bodily, physical (or in Beard's terms 'organic') explanation. That understanding defined the limits of psychiatry. When a condition could be explained in anatomical terms, it was no longer considered psychiatric and reverted to medical. When it could not—when it had to be explained in terms of 'psychic energy—it was given to the psychiatrists.
This thesis was not challenged largely in part because psychiatrists practiced in hospitals that contained psychiatric patients. That sounds circular, but it isn't: Pinel, Esquirol and Charcot were attempting to create a theory of mental illness that could explain the patients they say before them. The patients they saw before them were not brought there because they fit the theory, or because they had chosen to be there. They were brought to the Bicêtre and Salpêtrière when the rest of the medical community had given up attempting to explain their symptoms. The same can be said for Beard and Wier Mitchell: Perkins Gilman was taken to see Wier Mitchell only after all physical interventions had failed.
These founders of psychiatry theorized about a population that had been deemed mentally ill because the medical community had given up explaining their symptoms. Not the other way around. The Psychiatric hospital was a kind of catch-all for those individuals whose symptoms could not be alleviated by physical medicine, and hence it is unsurprising that the definitions of insanity we find in this era require the absence of a physical explanation.
In 1880, Josef Breuer, a student of the great psycho-physiologist Ewald Hering was studying the ear as a part of his research at Vienna General Hospital. It was there that he first met 'Anna O.', a young woman with an extremely acute cough. Finding no physical reason for the cough, her family physician diagnosed her with “typical tussis nurvosa [nervous cough]” (p 27)  Shortly thereafter a number of other symptoms arose. Freud &amp; Breuer describe her case thusly:
 Before this time she too had always enjoyed good health, showing no sign of nervous indisposition during her development. Of considerable intelligence, remarkably acute powers of reasoning, and a clear-sighted intuitive sense, her powerful mind could have digested, needed even, more substantial intellectual nourishment, but failed to receive it once she had left school. Her rich poetic and imaginative gifts were controlled by a very sharp and critical common sense. The latter also made her quite closed to suggestion. Only arguments had any influence on her, assertions were without effect. Her will was energetic, tenacious and persistent, sometimes heightened to such obstinacy that it would give way only out of kindness and consideration for others.
One of her principle traits was a sympathetic kindness. Even during her illness, she benefited greatly from the care and support she gave to some sick and poor people, for it allowed her to satisfy a strong drive. Her spirits always tended slightly to exaggeration, whether of joyfulness or grief, and as a consequence she was also somewhat moody. The element of sexuality was remarkably undeveloped: the patient, whose life became transparent to me in a way that seldom happens between people, had never been in love, and not once in the mass of hallucinations that occurred during her illness did this element of the inner life emerge...
...The course of the illness falls into several distinct phases. They are as follows:
A)	Latent incubation. From mid-July 1880 to approximately 10 December. This  case was exceptional because it afforded so complete an insight into a phase that in most cases escapes us, and for this reason alone its pathological interest could not be overestimated. I will expound on this part of the history later.
B)	Manifest illness: a peculiar kind of psychosis, paraphasia, stabismus convergens [convergent squint], sever visual disturbance, paralyzing contractures, complete paralysis in the upper right and both lower extremities, partial paralysis in the upper left extremity, paresis of the neck muscles. A gradual reduction in the contracture of the right extremities. Some improvement, interrupted by a sever psychical trauma (death of the father) in April, after which
C)	A period of continual somnambulism ensues, which then alternates with more normal states; continuation of a series of chronic symptoms until December 1881.
D)	Gradual winding down of mental states and symptoms until June 1882. (p25-26)
Breuer took over her care during the period of 'manifest illness,'  during which, Anna O. slept for great periods of time ('somnambulism'), but when she awoke in the evening, she would complain of 'torment.' Her speech lost all grammatical structure ('paraphasia') and she would piece together words and phrases from the five distinct languages she spoke, producing an incomprehensible jargon. This same jargon appeared in writing, so Breuer knew that it was not a disfunction of the physical mechanism of speech.
In the early spring of 1881, Anna O fell mute for a period of two weeks. At this point, Breuer claims that he “knew she had taken great offense at something and had resolved to say nothing about it. When I guessed as much and forced her to talk about it, the inhibition, which had until then made it impossible for her to speak about anything else either, disappeared.” (p 29)
After her father's death, her illness became much more severe. Breuer noticed, however, that her periods of sleep in the later afternoon, during which she was 'tormented' by hallucinations, resembled hypnotic states.  He decided to preemptively hypnotize her and prompt her to 'talk through' these tormenting phantasies. The symptoms subsided quickly.  The day after a session, she would become 'quite calm' and 'agreeable, obedient, industrious and even in good spirits'. The second day after a session she would be 'increasingly moody, contrary and disagreeable, and this worsened on the third.'  Anna O. named these sessions (in English) the 'talking cure' and 'chimney-sweeping.'  Breuer preferred the more sophisticated 'cathartic procedure.'
Breuer communicated this to his friend Sigmund Freud, who offered to co-author a paper laying out his findings. That paper, titled 'The Psychic Mechanism of Hysterical Phenomena,' first appeared in 1893, but was republished as the first chapter of Freud and Breuer's Studies on Hysteria (1895). In it, Freud and Breuer propose a new form of hysteria, called 'traumatic hysteria', which they conjecture is always connected to some traumatic event that evokes the syndrome. They further hypothesize that the traumatic event can be unavailable to the conscious, reflective mind of patient—i.e. be unconscious—yet still be causally responsible for the hysterical symptoms.  Moreover, they hypothesize that making the patient aware of the trauma, via Beuer's 'cathartic procedure' using hypnosis if necessary, alleviates the hysteria.
Freud: The foundation of psychoanalysis
The seeds of psychoanalysis were planted by Charcot and Breuer, but they did not develop into a full-fledged system of Psychiatry until Freud worked independently. Building on his theory of unconscious trauma to explain hysteria, Freud hypothesizes that traumatic events may manifest themselves in the mind indirectly in the form of symbols. He then went on to realize that the fantasy lives of the psychotic are full of such symbols, and recovering the original trauma requires investigation of the mechanisms of symbolization.
It was this realization that gives us the basis for psychoanalysis, for it is this realization that allows Freud to argue that the hallucinations and fantasies experiences by the psychotic are not significantly different from the dreams of the sane. Whereas prior to Freud, dreams and hallucinations were thought to be without meaning, after Freud they were seen as full of symbolic representations, the meanings of which were available empirically through systematic investigation of the mechanisms of psychological representation. Freud's proposed mechanisms are introduced in the 'Error! Reference source not found.' section on page Error! Bookmark not defined.  of the game book.
The barrier between the mentally ill and the mentally healthy had been permanently broken. No longer does the theory of psychiatry apply only to those who cannot be helped by medicine. Now the theory applies to everyone: a healthy person could become ill through unhealthy habits of mental representation, and ill people could become healthy through the process of discovering their habits of mental representation and recognizing their unconscious traumas.  
This conflation of psychiatric conditions and normal life left Freud in the precarious position of having to define 'mental illness.'  He did so thus:
Symptoms—and of course we are dealing now with psychical (or psychogenic) symptoms and psychical illness—are acts detrimental, or at least useless, to the subject's life as a whole, often complained by him as unwelcome and bringing unpleasure or suffering to him. (Introductory Lecture, p. 445)
Neurosis v. Psychosis
One of the hallmarks of Freud's theory is his thesis that the there is no hard and fast distinction to be made between the mentally ill and the mentally healthy. His Introductory Lectures are structured to introduce the reader to psychopathology in everyday life before extending the analysis of common activities to psychotics and neurotic patients.  As such, there are no hard and fast definitions of psychosis and neurosis.
During the course of normal development of mentally healthy adults, the ego must become 'reasonable': it must no longer let “itself be governed by the pleasure principle, but obeys the reality principle, which also at bottom seeks to obtain pleasure, but pleasure which is assured through taking account of reality, even though it is pleasure postponed and diminished.” (p. 444) A neurotic's ego fails to make this transition, and gets stuck at one point in development.  Thus, the neurotic's libido and ego are still struggling in a child-like way, but the contents of the struggle have been transformed into objects of adulthood. Neurotic symptoms are the “outcome of a conflict which arises over a new method of satisfying the libido” (p. 446) and a person is ill from neurosis only if “his ego has lost the capacity to allocate his libido in some way” (p. 480). A psychotic patient, however, has lost the battle for the reality principle, and the libido has created its own reality.
The object of a neurosis, then, is relevant to the diagnosis only insofar as it is a stand-in for the actual conflict by the mechanisms of repression, reaction formation, isolation, etc.  According to Freud: “clinical psychiatry takes little notice of the outward form or content of individual symptoms, but psychoanalysis takes matters up at precisely that point and has established in the first place the fact that symptoms have a sense and are related to the patient's experience.” (p. 318)
See Lectures 22 and 23 of the Introductory Lectures for a full discussion of neurosis and its origins.
The Clark Lectures
In 1909, G. Stanley Hall, first president of the American Psychological Association, invited Freud and Jung to give a series of lectures at Clark University. The conference itself was a major moment in the intellectual history of America, as such luminaries as William James, Franz Boas, Adolf Meyer and E.B. Tichner were in attendance, as well as the famed Anarchist Emma Goldman.
After the lectures, James Jackson Putnam, a neurologist in New York City, invited Freud and Jung to retire to his family's Adirondack 'great camp' for the weekend.  Putnam became an important advocate for psychoanalysis in the United States, establishing its legitimacy as a treatment for hysteria. While there are articles prior to 1909 on psychoanalysis (notably one by Putnam himself in 1906), we don't find significant discussion of  psychoanalysis in the mainstream journals of Psychology until after the Clark lectures. An effort to convince the American public of the scientific nature of psychoanalysis was mounted by Putnam camp attendees A.A. Brill, founder of the New York Psychoanalytic Society, and Ernest Jones, student of Freud. By 1916, Jones had published 20 articles, notes and reviews in the Journal of Abnormal Psychology offering or advocating for psychoanalysis.
Putnam and Freud went on to become close friends, and Putnam spent much of the rest of his career attempting to professionalize and regularize the practice of psychiatry. He founded the American Psychoanalytic Association (APsaA) in 1911, which is still active today. His posthumously published Addresses on Psychoanalysis, which contains a preface by Freud himself, not only seeks to introduce Freudian theory to his scientific community, but also to dispel misunderstanding gained “through the gossip of prejudice and misconception” (Putnam &amp; Jones, 1921, p. 3).
Putnam’s influence here cannot be understated. Putnam introduced psychoanalytic ideas to the budding field of medical neurology. His position as a medical doctor at Harvard gave psychoanalysis legitimacy as a medical practice in America, and his stature in the neurological community helped to assuage any doubts about the lack of a physical basis for the hypothetical entities posited by Freud's structural hypothesis.
The story is not all smooth sailing. In 1916, the Princeton philosopher and psychologist Warren Fite reviewed of Jung's Psychology of the Unconscious for The Nation, writing that it “presents some five hundred-odd pages of incoherence and obscenity in the form of a psycho-analytic interpretation of the experiences of a sentimental young American woman.” (Fite, 1916) The fact that the United States was at war with Germany didn't help the psychoanalytic cause: Christine Ladd-Franklin, a student of C.S. Peirce and protege of no less than Hermann Helmholtz as well as one of the first women in the APA, called Freud's theory the product of an “undeveloped... German mind.”
What followed is a history of tension between those in the psychological and psychoanalytic communities. Helped by the military's preference for psychoanalysts in the treatment of 'shell-shock' during WWI and 'combat fatigue' in WWII, psychoanalysis gained credibility in the eyes of the American public.
The DSMs
In 1917 during its annual meeting in New York, the American Medico-Psychological Association (now the American Psychiatric Association) in cooperation with the National Commission on Mental Hygiene formed a committee on statistics and charged it with creating a guide for classifying mental illness. The resulting document, Statistical Manual for the Use of Institutions for the Insane, was published in 1918 and adopted around the nation. It is available freely on google books.

Table 2: Statistical Manual for the Use of Institutions for the Insane classification of insanity, 1918
In 1928, the New York Academy of Medicine invited the Public Health Service, the Army and Navy Medical Departments and the American Hospital Association to collaborate on a standard nomenclature of disease. That standard was first published in 1933 as A Standard Classified Nomenclature of Disease, generally referred to as The Standard, and was widely used until at least the 1960s. In its original form, it used the following ten categories:
0 Diseases due to prenatal influences
1 Diseases due to lower plant and animal parasites
2 Diseases due to higher plant and animal parasites
3 Diseases due to intoxication
4 Diseases due to trauma or physical agents
5.0 Diseases due to circulatory disturbances
5.5 Diseases due to disturbances of innervation or of psychic control
6 Diseases due to or consisting of static mechanical abnormality (obstruction; calculus; displacement and gross changes in form etc., due to unknown cause).
7 Diseases due to disorders of metabolism, growth or nutrition
8 New growths
9 Diseases due to unknown or uncertain causes, the structural reaction (generative, infiltrative, inflammatory, proliferate, sclerotic, or reparative) to which is manifest; and hereditary and familial diseases of this nature.
X Diseases due to unknown or uncertain causes, the functional reaction to which is alone manifest; and hereditary and familial diseases of this nature.
Table 3: Standard Classified Nomenclature classification of disease, 1933
You'll notice that the medical classification is entirely based on the origin or cause of a condition, not the symptoms.  The opposite appears to be true of the psychiatric classification.
During the WWII, psychiatrists classified patients according to the standards of the branch of the armed forces for which they worked. In 1943, Brigadier General William C. Menninger issued a bulletin called “Medical 203” that laid the foundations for medical classification of mental illness. The Navy, Army and Veterans affairs branches all used slightly different diagnostic criteria and classifications.
In 1949, the International Statistical Classification of Diseases (ICD) included, for the first time, a taxonomy of mental disorders. Its classification system was:

Table 4: ICD-6 classification of mental diseases, 1949
In the interest of unifying these different classification schema, the American Psychiatric Association voted to create the first Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM). The nomenclature committee adapted the Medical 203 bulletin into the DSM and circulated it to a randomly selected sample of the membership (10%). When it was overwhelmingly approved by those who replied, the APA adopted it as the standard for diagnosis in medical treatment of psychological disorders. It was published in 1952, and is available online at http://www.psychiatryonline.com/DSMPDF/dsm-i.pdf
The first DSM distinguished between “Disorders caused by or associated with impairment of brain tissue function,” “Mental Deficiency,”  “Disorders of psychogenic origin or without clearly defined physical cause or structural change in the brain” and “Nondiagnostic Terms for Hospital Record.”  This fourth category included “Alcoholic intoxication (simple drunkenness),” and “Dead on admission.”  It is the third category, those without a physical cause, that is of the most interest to us (the corresponding category of the ICD-6 is included in the right most column):

Table 5: DSM-I Classification of mental disorders, 1952

The APA published the revised DSM-II in 1968. It's classification is included as an appendix.
The Rise of Psychopharmacology
Because psychoanalysis tended to be confined to clinical, military settings in the US, a kind of stable truce—one might even say a 'cold war'--settled over the conflict between behaviorism and psychoanalysis. By and large, psychoanalysis confined itself to the medical setting; while behaviorism confined itself to pure research. There were, no doubt, volleys across the bow of one or the other from time to time. But until Skinner's wide-ranging proposals for behaviorism as social reformation, there were few open hostilities.
Much of the scientific credibility for psychoanalysis turned on its success in treating psychotic patients.  Medical Doctors tend not to worry so much about the putative mechanism of a therapy, so long as that therapy works for the individual patient in question.  It isn't uncommon for a drug to help some small portion of the population and fail with another.  Generalizations to universal laws are uncommon in the practice of medicine, and much the of time the cause of a certain medical condition remains unknown, even if we understand how to cure it (consider cancers like lymphoma, for example). Thus, when psychologists objected that psychoanalysis did not generalize, its mechanisms were untestable, and as a treatment it was highly individualistic, medical practitioners were not overly impressed.  
All of that changed starting in 1955 when Wallace Labs began marketing the world's first popular psychotropic for the treatment of anxiety: Miltown. The Wallace Lab claimed that Miltown controlled anxiety without reducing mental function, allowing patients to return to their normal lives. It was quickly followed by Trofranil, an antidepressant, in 1959; Librium, an anti-anxiety medication, in 1960; and Valium in 1963.
These drugs did—in short order—what years of psychoanalysis, hypnosis, electro-shock therapy (the decedent of Beard's treatments) and confinement could not: they allowed patients with crippling anxiety to return to normal or close-to-normal functioning.
Setting the stage for 1971
Since the origin of psychiatry, there has been a distinction made between those disorders that can be directly attributable to a biological dysfunction of the brain and those that cannot. The former were classified as 'neurological,' and the latter 'psychiatric.'  It is this inability to find a biological etiology of the disorder defines the domain of psychiatry.
As it becomes increasingly clear that psycho-pharmaceuticals have an effect on disorders once believed to be independent of the biology of the brain, what will happen to the field of psychiatry?

            <Comments>See, e.g. Treatise on Insanity, p. 46
The story of how Pinel became interested in insanity is frequently retold. Like Newton's apple, it is probably something of a myth, although there may be some core of truth. Here it is, as told by himself in A Treatise on Insanity:
	The loss of a friend, who became insane through excessive love of glory, in 1783, and the ineptitude of pharmaceutic preparations to the mind elated, as his was, with a high sense of its independence, enhanced my admiration of the judicous precepts of the ancients, and made me regret that I had it not then in my power to put them in practice. (p 52)
From a letter by Marx 1846:
	...in 1785, he had the misfortune to lose a young man to whom he was much attached, and whose reason became affected through excessive study and abstinence. This unfortunate person, after his return to his family, became maniacal, one evening he escaped from his father's house into the neighboring forest and was devoured by wolves; a few torn rags were found the following day, and near them a copy of the Phaedra covered with blood.
And by Lisa Appignanesi in 2009:
A shy provincial like himself, the friend had fallen into despair and then 'mania' when his legal aspirations failed to materialize. Unable to help the younger man once he had all but ceased to eat, Pinel had brought him to the Hôtel-Dieu where a treatment of baths and food seemed to restore him. But his worried family intervened and took him home before he was quite well. The youth escaped their hold, fled to the woods and was found dead only after the wolves had got him. (p58)
From a letter of honor, included in Marx 1846: “He who walks in an odoriferous flower-garden, which had formerly been a pestilential swamp, will best be able to appreciate what you effected in madhouses. Formerly an atmosphere almost stifling, damp rooms, the clank of chains, the cries of those under the lash, the hoarse growl of the rough attendants, the desperate frenzy of the ill-used patients; these succeeded by clean apartments, the greatest humanity in personal attentions, and an atmosphere of peace and confidence throughout the whole establishment. (p.210)
See Roberty Fleury's 'Dr. Phillippe Pinel at the Salpêtrière' (1795)
See, e.g p. 3, Section 4, p 134. Also, from the Marx (1846): Every delusion is the result of confused modes of thinking; wrong and crime originate in ignorance.” (p. 212)
Each humour had an associated personality type. Imbalance in a given humour was thought to be the cause of imbalances in mood or personality: people with too much black bile were melancholic, yellow bile choleric (full of energy), blood sanguine (impulsive), and phlegm phlegmatic (emotional). See Aristotle's Problems Bk 3, Section1 Galen's De temperamentis, and Avicenna's The Canon of Medicine for more detail.
The modern reader of A Treatise on Insanity is impressed by the number of times that Pinel stresses these two features of mental illness. We take both of these for granted to such an extent that the work can seem highly repetitive and redundant. But they were radical theses in the late 18th century, and Pinel's thoroughness in covering the topics no doubt reflects the importance of these thesis in his own mind.

In his 'History of the Psychiatric Movement', Freud writes: “...It was the case of the young married couple from the far East. The wife was a great sufferer and the husband was impotent, or exceedinly awkward. I head Charcot repeat: “Tâchez donc, je vous assure vous y arriverez.” Brouardel, who spoke less distinctly, must have expressed his astonishment that such symptoms as those of the young wife should have appeared as a result of such circumstances, for Charcot said suddenly and with great vivacity: “Mais, dans de cas pareils, c'est toujours la chose génital, toujours—toujours-toujours.” And while saying that, he crossed his hands in his lap an jumped up and down several times, with the vivacity peculiar to him.” (Freud, 1938, p. 937-938)
See, for example, Drellich, Marvin G. “Classical Psychoanalytic School” in Arieti, S. (1974). American handbook of psychiatry (2d ed.). New York,: Basic Books.
I am simplifying here a bit. While Freud is commonly believed to originate the idea that dreams and psychotic hallucinations were best understood on a continuum, the ideas appears in the work of the British associationist Alexander Bain (see, e.g. Bain, A. (1903) Dissertations on Leading Philosophical Topics, Longmans, Green, and Co., New York and Bombay., p. 45)
The distinction between neurosis and psychosis has always been controversial. Consider Pavlov's comment in his 1927 lectures: “Contemporary medicine distinguishes "nervous" and "psychic" disturbances-neuroses and psychoses, but this distinction is, of course, only arbitrary. No real line of demarcation can be drawn between these two groups: it is impossible to imagine a deviation of higher activities from normal without a functional or structural disturbance of the cortex.” (Pavlov, 1927, Lecture 23)
