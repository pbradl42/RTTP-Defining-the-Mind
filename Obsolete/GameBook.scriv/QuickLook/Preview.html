The Game<br/>
This game highlights the intellectual conflicts that changed American psychiatry and psychology in the early part of the 1970s. It might seem a little odd, in reacting game, to be exploring relatively recent events. While there will be no executions, ostracisms or civil wars in this game, the intellectual stakes are no less high. What you know of Psychiatry and Psychology today—the social significance of the APA's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM), the use of psychotropic drugs f...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>gameBasics</strong><br/>Game Play<br/>
<br/>
Each week (two or three sessions, depending on your schedule) of game play reenacts one annual conference of the APA in the early 1970s.  Thus, the five weeks of game play cover the years 1971-1975. These conferences are huge events. There are presentations on current research, symposia on issues facing the discipline, administrative meetings for various committees, public discussions and votes on proclamations, and publishers promoting their products.<br/>

Main Factions<br/>
Players represent three factions with different perspectives on not only the nature of scientific inquiry into the human mind, but the object of those studies themselves.  A number of independents, representing a variety of academic disciplines, complement these three factions.<br/>
It should be noted that unlike some other reacting games, individuals in these factions are not bound to think or vote the same way on the central issues in the game. The faction...</p>

<br/>
Ethical codes of research have generally followed the discovery or publication of horrifically unethical experiments.  The most famous of these is probably the Nuremberg Code, adopted by the international medical community after the discovery of the Nazi 'experiments' performed on Jews, Homosexuals and Gypsies during the Holocaust.  The Nuremberg code is available online, and should be reviewed by anyone proposing an experiment or sitting on the Research Committee. See ...</p>

Brief history of definitions of 'Psychology'<br/>
Pre-history of Psychology:<br/>
The scientific investigation into the human mind and/or human behavior begins almost simultaneously with science itself.  We must then begin with the followers of Francis Bacon, and trace the idea that the mind is open to empirical inquiry through the empiricists into the present day.<br/>
Bacon, who we now credit with establishing 'The Scientific Method,' argued that the human mind tended to distort reality in regular, systemat...</p>

History of classifications of mental illness<br/>
<br/>
While behaviors associated with mental illness—hallucinations, catatonic states, mania, etc.—have been known since ancient times, psychiatry dates its regularization as a scientific discipline to the work of the French physician Phillipe Pinel. His Traité médico-philosophique sur l'aliénation mentale; ou la manie stands as the first attempt at a scientific classification of mental illness. The book, translated as Treatise on Insanity in 1806 by D.D....</p>

Brief History of Homosexuality in America<br/>
While homosexual behavior has appeared throughout human history, the notion of homosexuality as an orientation or personality is relatively recent.  The etymology of the word 'homosexual' itself shows the intimate connection between the idea of sexual orientation and the history of psychiatry.  According to the OED, the term first appears in print in English in C. G. Chaddock translation of R. von Krafft-Ebing 1892 Psychopathia Sexualis. Relevant sectio...</p>

Structuralism<br/>
<br/>
Bloomfield structuralism in American, originated with Saussuer's 'Course in General Linguistics' from 1916.  Bloomfield was sympathetic to Watson's behaviorism. Structuralism in Europe became identified with sympathetic movements in Anthropology (), Psychoanalysis and Marxism, but is largely known through the critiques by the 'Post-Structuralists' wh...</p>

A Primer on Research Methods<br/>
Let's start with a plausibly empirical claim—one that you may believe:<br/>
(A) To be educated, one must study.<br/>
How might one investigate that claim scientifically? Notice, first of all, that it is a general claim. 'One' is a pronoun that could stand for any person, so the claim is universal in nature. We cannot claim that a universal claim like this is true unless it is true for every person. But that is empirically impossible to verify.<br/>
One might think, then, that clai...</p>

Appendix 2. Excerpt from Krafft-Ebbing Psychopathia Sexualis<br/>
This excerpt contains three excerpts from Charles Gilbert Chaddock's translation of Dr. R. von Krafft-Ebbing's Psychopathia Sexualis:<br/>
1. Pages 185-356, covering what Krafft-Ebbing calls the “Contrary sexual instinct, or homo-sexuality.” You'll notice that Krafft-Ebbing lumps a number of sexual activities we would now distinguish together.<br/>
